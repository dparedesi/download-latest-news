A clip shared by New York-based Amazon engineer, Abir Bhattacharjee, detailing how he came to know about the company's massive layoffs has gone viral. In the clip on social media, Abir is seen speaking with another person, casually sharing the moment he realised what was coming. “I had lunch at 4 p.m. I knew this was layoff week. Everyone knew,” he said in the Instagram video shared on Monday evening. Abir explained that he was deploying a big update to production, which was related to the customer-facing stage. After a quick lunch, he returned to his desk when his coworker asked him if he had “seen it”. “I thought production had broken,” Abir said. But his coworker looked worried for another reason. That’s when Abir learned that Amazon was planning to lay off 30,000 employees. “That’s how I knew it was happening tomorrow,” the tech influencer, who has nearly 40,000 followers on Instagram, said. His video has garnered more than 50,000 likes so far. Following this, the other person in the video mentions the company is also planning to lay off 6,00,000 factory workers in 2028. He then suggests Abir could join the factory floor then. A post shared by Abir Bhattacharjee (@abirbhattacharjee___) To this, Abir retorts in a light-hearted vein: “I'm too polished now. I like sitting at my pretty desk. I can't live a hard life.” He then follows up with a question, wondering what his next move would be if he got laid off. The other person then jokingly says: “Startup”. Concluding the video, Abir speaks on a more serious note that he will certainly need a plan B the next morning, referring to the potential layoffs in the next few hours. It is to be noted that NDTV Profit has not independently verified Abir's employment with Amazon. On Tuesday, Amazon announced job cuts for 14,000 workers, marking the first phase of its bold plan to eliminate 30,000 roles. The layoffs mark the latest move by the tech giant to slash costs and preserve cash amid a slowing economy. Sources said the reductions, which may roll out over several weeks, will impact roughly 10% of Amazon’s corporate workforce. Many employees reported receiving a text message from the company on Tuesday morning, which confirmed they had been laid off. The incident has sparked a broader debate about modern employment and the increasing impact of artificial intelligence on the job market.

Title: Amazon's cloud boss says the company feels 'quite good' about its massive AI bets

Every time Lee Chong Ming publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is pouring billions into AI infrastructure, and its cloud boss says the company is confident its bets will pay off. The Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said in an interview with CNBC Television published Wednesday that the company feels "quite good" about its massive AI investments, despite rising fears that the AI boom could become a bubble. "Others may have maybe more speculative investments," Garman said in the interview recorded on October 17. "We're very intentional about how we think about leveraging risk and thinking about how we have the long-term view of what this business looks like." Garman's remarks come as Amazon announced the activation of Project Rainier, its $11 billion AI data center in rural Indiana. The announcement coincides with one of the company's biggest ever rounds of layoffs. Project Rainier, one of the largest AI data centers in the world, is dedicated to training and running models from Anthropic, one of Amazon's key AI partners and a rival to OpenAI. More than 500,000 AWS Tranium 2 chips have already been deployed at the data center, which is fully operational and scheduled to double in scale by year-end, Garman said. Garman told CNBC that AWS has spent nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures over the past year building infrastructure. Amazon announced Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs to make it leaner as AI enables companies to "innovate much faster." Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, said in a blog post that Amazon needs to have fewer management layers to move faster. The company is shifting resources to invest in its biggest bets, reducing in some areas and hiring in others, Galetti added. Amazon has 1.55 million employees globally. The cuts represent about 4% of Amazon's roughly 350,000 corporate employees. AWS did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Amazon's latest layoffs are a continuation of the company's yearslong effort to slim down and refocus. In recent years, the company has trimmed management layers, tightened costs, and overhauled pay and performance systems. Amazon announced last September that most corporate staff would have to return to the office five days a week. When growth slowed after the pandemic, Amazon started cutting unprofitable projects and a bloated workforce. CEO Andy Jassy said in a June memo that AI-driven efficiency gains would further shrink head count. Earlier this year, Amazon froze hiring in its retail division, and in July, AWS also saw layoffs. It's not just Amazon cutting thousands of jobs this year. Microsoft announced plans in July to cut about 15,000 roles this year to focus on "security, quality, and AI transformation," while Meta said last week it is cutting roles in its risk organization and replacing them with automation technology.

Title: The Duplicity of Land O’ Lakes Cooperative
URL: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/10/30/the-duplicity-of-land-o-lakes-cooperative/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T05:53:00Z
Full Content:
Image Source: Land O Lakes Co. – Flickr – Public Domain Land O’ Lakes dairy cooperative was founded in 1921 in St. Paul Minnesota by 320 small cooperative creameries. They hoped to improve the quality of butter produced in Minnesota as well as implement better marketing practices thereby improving the profitability of dairy farmers. That’s always been the goal of farmer cooperatives, by working together, groups of small farmers can get better prices for what they sell and pay lower prices for the inputs they have to buy. That was the theory, part of the cooperative thinking that made rural America a better place. Farmer cooperatives were supportive of parity pricing, introduced in Roosevelt’s 1933 Agriculture Adjustment Act– the first Farm Bill, that ensured farmers a fair price. In their early years, cooperatives truly had the best interests of their farmer members at heart. But as some cooperatives grew into national powerhouses and many small local cooperatives went out of business, farmers felt the big cooperatives looked more like corporations than the small cooperative cheese factories or local feed mills that they grew up with, growth seemed more important than the collective good of the farmers. In a recent piece in Time magazine Land O’ Lakes CEO Beth Ford voiced her concern at the continuing loss of farmers, low commodity prices and declining farm income which dropped 25% from 2022 to 2024. Estimates put median farm income for 2025 at -$328. It’s not a new phenomenon, according to USDA data, the average US dairy farm turned a profit twice between 2000 and 2021. She mentions that farmers are getting older, with more farmers over the age of 75 than under the age of 35— no wonder, not many 20 or 30 somethings would take a job knowing they would probably be working for a negative income while slowly loosing their equity. Still, kudos to Beth Ford for at least pointing out some of the problems farmers have always faced, —basically an up and down cycle of good years and bad, with luck, enough good years to keep going, but never enough good years to be consistently profitable. But, there is more to the story of Land O’ Lakes. Most agribusiness CEO’s (while collecting their seven figure salaries) and their well compensated boards of directors, move their business model towards more growth and advise farmers to adopt more “efficient farming practices” meaning a shift to fewer, but larger farms that can afford the capital investments required to stay in business as markets, credit and infrastructure favor growth. So, while lamenting the loss of so many farms and farmers, Land O’ Lakes, through their own business model of consolidation has promoted this trend. “As agricultural markets consolidate, competition lessens, meaning producers and consumers have fewer options”. “Milk producers historically organized into co-ops to counterbalance concentrated power among buyers, but today, the largest co-ops, such as Dairy Farmers of America and Land O’ Lakes, prey off of small-scale producers they’re supposed to protect and strike arrangements with massive milk processors, like Dean Foods, that result in additional wealth transfers from farmers to their own executives”. While farm income has continued to drop, one of Ms. Ford’s solutions, —robust trade, apparently hasn’t raised farm incomes either. The US has promoted liberalized international trade of agricultural commodities for over 50 years, and even more aggressively since the 1996 farm bill that wanted to “get the government out of the marketplace”, yet farmers still can’t make a living and “get big or get out” is accepted as inevitable. Despite their squashing of competition in the domestic dairy sector, Land O’ Lakes has established a “strategic partnership” with the worlds largest dairy exporter, New Zealand based Fonterra. Apparently importing New Zealand cream cheese, non-dairy butter spread etc, will help US dairy farmers? Cooperatives are supposed to work for the best interests of their farmer owners, so it’s also unclear why a CEO and the cooperative board would think that engaging in illegal activities would be in the best interests the cooperative in general, specifically, its farmers. Yet they did, resulting in the price-fixing lawsuits and the ensuing settlements in dairy and in poultry for a total of $297 million. I doubt the farmer owners voted to enter into these scandals, but they paid for them. So, as mentioned, when cooperatives get too big, they often begin to act like a corporation, not a cooperative. Ms. Ford finally notes that “As private equity firms have become financial buyers of farmland, consolidation trends are changing. In Iowa alone, 20 million of its 30 million acres of farmland are set to transition. When farms are owned by firms, not families, communities wither. Contract farming does not plant community roots”. An odd comment for someone who has held a seat on the Board of Directors of BlackRock, an investment firm with considerable holdings in US farmland, agribusiness corporations and recently in Ukrainian farmland. While she stated that she was “honored to join this impactful organization” her resignation a year later, “was not a result of any disagreement with the Company, the Company’s management or the Board”, — so, she was part of their investment strategy and apparently did not disagree with it. Money and power can corrupt and cooperatives, can become that which they sought to oppose. Jim Goodman is a dairy farmer from Wonewoc, Wisconsin.

Shares in three of the “Magnificent Seven” — Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta — moved in different directions in after-hours trading after they released their third-quarter results. The earnings once again underscored how artificial intelligence continues to dominate Big Tech’s growth story and investor sentiment. (Source: Reuters) Alphabet’s shares surged 6.2% after the Google parent beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue. Both its core advertising business and its cloud computing unit showed steady growth. The company also raised its capital expenditure forecast for the year to between $91 billion and $93 billion, far above earlier projections of around $80 billion. Microsoft’s stock fell 3.4% in extended trading even after posting blockbuster growth in its cloud-computing business, which pushed its quarterly revenue past expectations. The results showed that businesses are still spending aggressively on AI services despite concerns about a potential bubble. Analysts noted that Microsoft’s heavy AI investments are now starting to deliver meaningful returns. Meta’s shares dropped more than 8% after the company reported a $16 billion one-time charge in the third quarter related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The social media giant also said its capital expenditure next year would be “notably larger” than in 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading an AI talent hiring spree and plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in massive AI data centres for superintelligence. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the results were a mixed bag for markets. “The good reaction in Alphabet offsets Microsoft’s uninspiring outcome and Meta’s surprise tax loss,” he said, adding that the stock moves were mostly within expected volatility ranges, with Microsoft’s reaction relatively muted. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the latest earnings confirm that there is no sign of a slowdown in the AI capital spending boom. The firm noted that the combined capital expenditure of the three companies rose by $14 billion quarter-on-quarter, or more than 22%, maintaining the same pace as the previous quarter and up 88% from a year ago. Despite the mixed share price reactions, the overall message is clear — AI remains the centrepiece of Big Tech’s long-term strategy. While short-term costs are weighing on profitability, investors continue to bet that these massive infrastructure investments will yield significant payoffs in the years ahead.

Stablecoin leader Circle, the issuer of USDC, has officially launched its Arc testnet with VISA, Mastercard and other major partners, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as the “economic operating system for the internet.” Related Reading: Solana Price Set For Double-Digit Rally Above $230: Analyst Reveals How To Spot Next Move The testnet already counts over 100 major participants from finance, technology, and payments, including, as mentioned, Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Coinbase, all collaborating to bridge the gap between TradFi and the on-chain economy. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described Arc as purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy, emphasizing its ability to facilitate lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. Arc’s design centers on USDC as the native gas token, offering predictable dollar-based transaction fees and sub-second finality, features that make it uniquely appealing for regulated financial operations. Arc’s debut underscores a growing institutional appetite for blockchain infrastructure that balances regulatory compliance with decentralized programmability. Participants such as Apollo, BNY Mellon, and State Street join payment titans and fintech leaders in testing Arc’s capabilities. Circle has also enlisted developer partners like Alchemy, Chainlink, and Anthropic, while Coinbase and Uniswap are providing liquidity support. The network integrates optional privacy controls to ensure compliance with data-protection standards while enabling transparency for audits and settlements. This balance is crucial for large financial institutions exploring tokenized assets, real-time settlements, and programmable payments. In a significant regional development, South Korean firm BDACS announced it will issue its Korean won-backed stablecoin (KRW1) on Circle’s Arc blockchain, a move aimed at expanding South Korea’s regulated stablecoin presence on the global stage. While Circle currently oversees Arc’s testnet operations, the company plans to transition toward community-governed decentralization in the future. Compliance partners like Elliptic are already integrating monitoring tools to strengthen transparency across the ecosystem. Industry analysts view Arc as Circle’s most ambitious project yet, a move that could reshape how banks, fintechs, and enterprises conduct cross-border payments and tokenized finance.

Title: Executives Don’t See AI Undercutting Jobs Yet

Time Published: 2025-10-30T02:52:04Z

ByJoe McKendrick, Senior Contributor. AI a job killer? While AI gets partially the blame for headline-grabbing layoffs such as Amazon shedding 14,000 employees, it’s notable that more than five million people still get hired monthly within the United States. The latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the hiring rate at 5,126,000 for the month of August. Less than two in 10 executives, at most, foresee job cuts as a result of AI in their own organizations, according to the authors of a new study of 800 business leaders out of University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and GBK Collective. If anything, 40% expect AI to help boost hiring of entry-level jobs, while another 40% say their hiring patterns will not change. Only 18% foresee AI decreasing entry-level job opportunities. Likewise, 33% of executives expect AI to increase hiring of executives, and another 54% expect no effect on the sizes of their executive staffs. This is the third year for this particular study, conducted by Wharton’s Human-AI Research (WHAIR) center. Some parts of the business will see the greater impact from AI than others. IT departments lead the pack, with 47% affected by AI, up from 30% in the 2023 survey. Purchasing and procurement comes in at 39%, up from 14% just two years ago. At least 37% of product development and engineering departments will be reshaped by AI, up from 22% in the 2023 survey. When it comes to measuring relative success rates with generative AI, the Wharton study paints a generally positive picture. A few weeks back, a lot of eyebrows were being raised about MIT researchers’ estimates that only five percent of generative AI projects are showing tangible results in businesses. The current Wharton study, on the other hand, finds at least three in four enterprises, 74%, are already seeing positive returns on their genAI investments, the Wharton survey finds. These results are based on solid ROI metrics such as productivity, profitability and throughput. The successes with AI were self-reported in the Wharton/GBK study, as the co-authors note that they “intentionally asked the question about ROI for gen AI in a fairly broad way to allow leaders to essentially answer according to their own definition.” Are executives compelled to portray a rosier picture of their efforts? Who knows, right? Perhaps there is greater comfort with AI. Close to half of these executives, 46%, now use gen AI on a daily basis in their work. A majority, 82%, use it weekly. On average, 82% business leaders expect their AI investments to pay off in just two to three years. With the technology evolving almost every day, the greatest inhibitor is “skill atrophy” — meaning it takes talent and training, not just technology, to fully succeed with AI. Decision-makers see gen AI as a supplement to human capital (89% agree), more than a replacement (71% agree). Still, 43% agree that gen AI will lead to declines in proficiency. The higher you go up the corporate hierarchy, the more optimism you find pertaining to gen AI. Leaders at the vice-president level and above are much more optimistic about early ROI for their gen AI investments compared to mid-managers, with 45% reporting significantly positive returns (defined as greater than 20% ROI) versus only 27% of mid-managers. Mid-managers, the survey shows, are more cautious, and are twice as likely to say it is “too early to tell/still in pilot phase” (16% versus 8% of senior leaders).

Title: Meta’s stock slides on AI bubble fears, as Zuckerberg calls for increased spending

UPDATED 22:19 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2025 by Mike Wheatley Meta Platforms Inc.’s plans to increase spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure made investors jittery today, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading, despite the social network posting solid earnings and revenue beats. In its third-quarter results, the company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $7.25 per share, crushing Wall Street’s targets. Analysts had projected earnings of just $6.69 per share. The company’s revenue also came in above expectations, rising 26% from a year earlier, to $51.24 billion. The Street had been looking for just $49.41 billion in sales. However, the company’s bottom line took a massive hit in the quarter, with net income coming to just $2.7 billion, down from a profit of $15.68 billion in the year-ago period. That’s because Meta was slapped with a substantial onetime tax charge of $15.93 billion that relates to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently implemented One Big Beautiful Bill Act. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the Act will ultimately be beneficial to the company, leading to a “significant reduction” in its federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) hailed what he said was a strong quarter for both the business and its community. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses,” he added. “If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.” Looking at the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $56 billion and $59 billion, with the midpoint of that range falling just shy of Wall Street’s target of $57.58 billion estimate. It wasn’t the guidance that got investors unduly worried, but rather the fact that Meta once again announced plans to increase its spending. Li told analysts the company is raising the low end of its spending forecast by $2 billion, and said the new forecast range is now between $116 billion and $118 billion, up from a range of $114 billion to $118 billion. In addition, the company also upped its fiscal 2025 capital expenditure guidance, saying this will now amount to between $70 billion and $72 billion, up from a previous range of $66 billion to $72 billion. In recent months, concerns have been growing among some critics that the extravagant spending by Meta and its big technology peers is fueling a bubble in the AI industry that may one day burst, with potentially devastating consequences for the stock market. The company has invested billions of dollars into AI, not only on the data center infrastructure it needs but also in acquiring talented developers, such as Scale AI Inc. founder Alexandr Wang, who now heads up the company’s Superintelligence Labs unit. On the call, Zuckerberg did his best to address these concerns, saying that he is seeing a “pattern” that shows Meta will likely need to invest in even more computing infrastructure than it initially believed it would need. That’s why the company has also signed massive, multibillion-dollar cloud computing contracts with the likes of Google Cloud, Oracle Corp. and CoreWeave Inc., he said. But he believes these investments will pay off handsomely for the company over time. “Being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over some period,” he promised. Moreover, he expressed confidence that overspending wouldn’t necessarily be the disaster that many envisage. He said that if AI doesn’t grow as fast as he anticipates, the company can always repurpose its new infrastructure for other workloads, such as improving its core recommendation algorithms. He said there’s potential to do this “in a very profitable way.” Zacks Investment Research analyst Andrew Rocco told SiliconANGLE that the increased capex spend suggests that Meta ultimately believes AI will result in people spending more time using its applications, which will generate more advertising revenues from the company. He’s especially optimistic about the prospects of Instagram Reels, which is its highest-growing ad segment. Moreover, he believes most investors understand this. “I expect deep-pocketed institutional investors to defend the stock in the coming days at the $690 to $700 level,” Rocco said. During the quarter, Meta completed a massive overhaul of its AI organization, snatching up Wang and other high-profile talents and creating the Superintelligence Labs unit in the wake of the lukewarm reception of its open-source Llama 4 model in April. Last week, the company caused a surprise when it said it’s laying off about 600 workers from its AI teams, while leaving its top-level TBD Labs alone. Last month, the company debuted a new feature called Vibes in the Meta AI application, which delivers a feed of AI-generated videos, and it has had a promising start. Since Vibes was launched, Meta AI app downloads have increased by 56% to a total of just over 3.9 million. “Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,” Zuckerberg told analysts. AI may also make a difference to the fortunes of Meta’s Reality Labs business, which has been likened to a black hole or a money pit due to the staggering losses it posts quarter after quarter. In the last three months, it racked up a loss of just over $4.4 billion while generating just $470 million in sales. Moreover, Li said, Reality Labs’ revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from the same period last year. That’s because the company has not released a new virtual reality headset this year, mainly because retailers who purchased inventory of its existing model are waiting to shift that stock over the holiday season. “We’re still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we’ve introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,” Li said. She was referring to the company’s newly announced Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which launched last month with a $799 price tag. They’re the company’s first consumer-ready AI glasses to feature an integrated display in the lens. They also come with a wristband that enables users to navigate through that display using gesture controls. According to Zuckerberg, the product is sold out, and all demo slots for November have been fully booked up. “We’re going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,” he explained. Meta reported 3.54 billion daily active people across its family of applications in the quarter, surpassing Wall Street’s target of 3.5 billion. Total advertising sales came to $50.08 billion, also beating expectations. Analysts had been looking for $48.5 billion in ad revenue. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said the strong ad performance was the main factor behind Meta’s earnings and revenue beat. “Advertising momentum grew 26% in the quarter, benefitting from increased ad impressions, up 14%, and higher average pricing of around 10%,” he said. “Better pricing was key to the beat.” Despite today’s after-hours drop, Meta’s stock has still gained more than 28% in the year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index, which is up just over 17% in the same period.

Title: General Motors to slash nearly 1,700 jobs across the US amid EV demand concerns– who will be impacted?

GM layoffs: General Motors (GM) announced on Wednesday plans to cut US electric vehicle and battery production. It will lay off 1,200 workers at its Detroit EV plant and 550 at a battery plant in Ohio, as a response to a slowdown in battery car demand, Reuters reported. In January, the automaker said it would pause battery cell production at two US joint-venture battery plants in Tennessee and Ohio for nearly six months. Meanwhile, GM will temporarily lay off 5,500 employees across three plants. This includes 3,400 workers furloughed at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit, where the electric Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Hummer EVs are produced. The company stated on Wednesday that it will evaluate the required level of production and reinstate approximately 2,200 of those employees in January when the plant resumes operations on a single shift. The remaining 1,200 will be furloughed indefinitely, Bloomberg reported. The layoffs come as several companies announce job cuts. E-commerce giant Amazon recently confirmed it will slash 14,000 jobs across departments amid its push for artificial intelligence (AI). From January, GM will reduce production at its Detroit EV plant to one shift, down from the current two, following previous layoffs at the facility. This change will decrease output by roughly 50%. The plant manufactures three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, along with the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV. General Motors said the production and job cuts were “in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.” Last month, it lobbied Congress and the White House to ease emissions requirements, the report said. US automakers are significantly reducing their EV plans, expecting a rapid decline in consumer demand once the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires. Experts say that EV sales could potentially drop by 50% in the upcoming months after surpassing 10% of total US car sales this summer, the report said. Nissan, Jeep-maker Stellantis, and other automakers have halted plans for upcoming electric models. Earlier in October, GM announced it was cancelling the production of its Brightdrop electric van, citing slow progress in the commercial EV van market. GM has revised its outlook for EV sales downward and implemented additional EV production cuts this year. United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain criticised GM for the job cuts, highlighting that the company increased its expected annual profits to $13 billion this month. "The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond," the report quoted Fain. The company said it cut around 500 white-collar jobs in the last week. In 2021, GM announced plans to shift to all EV sales by 2035 and increased investment, but it has since scaled back its efforts amid dwindling demand. Last week, GM CEO Mary Barra said, "With an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it's clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned." She also hoped that the automaker would reduce EV losses from 2026 onwards. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With AI rolling out across industries, one question has loomed: will people lose their jobs? Amazon kick-started an answer this week. On Tuesday, the Jeff Bezos-owned tech giant cut 14,000 workers across its corporate workforce. Amazon said the deep cuts were the latest in CEO Andy Jassey's plan to have the firm act "like the world's largest startup." Business Insider's tech team used internal documents to reveal how Amazon's top brass shared the news, what they told workers who were laid off, and their advice for the staff who remained. But all eyes are now on what comes next — not just for Amazon but companies beyond Silicon Valley as artificial intelligence rattles a frozen job market. Is AI behind Amazon's decision to lay off 14,000 employees, and will more companies follow suit with layoffs of their own? Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito joined Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to discuss. Kim broke news about the divisions of Amazon hit hardest by the layoffs, while Ito's latest piece explored how Amazon's full-throttle approach to layoffs could be a warning sign of more AI-related job cuts. In our chat, Kim and Ito tackled Amazon's business case for the layoffs, looked ahead to the company's earnings, and flagged what white-collar workers should watch for in this new age of AI.

YouTube is offering employee buyouts as part of a major reorganization, CEO Neal Mohan said on Wednesday in a memo to staffers that was obtained by Business Insider. "Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform," Mohan wrote. "We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity." Mohan said YouTube, which is owned by Google, was creating three separate product organizations that would report directly to him: viewer products, creator and community products, and subscriptions products. No layoffs were planned as part of the reorganization, which is set to take effect on November 5. "But we also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a Voluntary Exit Program," Mohan said, adding the YouTube employees in the United States would be receiving more information about the buyout option. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several companies have recently made cuts to their workforce — in part due to AI. Amazon announced this week that it was slashing more than 14,000 jobs in order to position itself to innovate faster in the age of AI. Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported record earnings on Wednesday, achieving its first-ever $100 billion quarter. Read Mohan's full memo to YouTube employees below: Jump to

Title: Tether now holds $135B in U.S. debt – Bigger than South Korea!

Tether backs USDT with $135B in Treasuries, becoming a major player in global liquidity markets. It prompted Tether to launch USA₮, a compliant dollar-backed token tailored for U.S. regulations. Yes, but USDC is gaining ground in transaction volume and institutional adoption. The rise of stablecoins is increasingly being felt beyond the digital asset market. Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, now backs its token supply with approximately $135 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, according to recent disclosures. That figure makes Tether the 17th largest U.S. debt holder globally, surpassing countries such as South Korea and nearing Brazil, as noted by Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino. The development underscores how dollar-pegged crypto assets have evolved into meaningful participants in global liquidity flows, particularly in the short-term bond market. This comes at a time when the stablecoin market is entering a new regulatory and competitive phase, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, establishing a clearer regulatory path for compliant stablecoins in the U.S. market. In response, Tether introduced USA₮, a dollar-backed token specifically designed to meet the new U.S. regulatory requirements. Rival issuer Circle, meanwhile, has been expanding partnerships and infrastructure placements, and overseas players like Japan’s JPYC are also scaling operations to tap into rising global stablecoin demand. At the transaction level, stablecoin usage remains massive. Visa’s on-chain analytics further show that stablecoins facilitated $6.4 trillion in total transfers over the past 30 days. While USDT typically leads market activity, October data illustrate a competitive shift. This is because USDC recorded approximately $669.15 billion in monthly transaction volume, slightly ahead of USDT’s $607.98 billion during the same period. The figures suggest that while USDT still dominates overall market share and circulation, USDC is gaining meaningful traction in payments and institutional pipelines. At the same time, Tether is expanding beyond stablecoins altogether. Tether Data, the company’s technology unit, recently announced the launch of QVAC Genesis I, a 41-billion-token synthetic dataset built to train science- and engineering-focused AI models. Alongside it, the firm introduced QVAC Workbench, an application that allows users to run AI models directly on local devices. However, AMBCrypto’s analysis shows USDT still leads the market with a 79% share in August 2025, but its dominance is slowly slipping as USDC gains ground. While USDC offers stronger transparency and fully liquid reserves overseen by BlackRock, USDT’s mix of assets, ranging from Treasuries to Bitcoin and commodities, raises more debate. However, the 10th October flash de-peg proved that stability isn’t just about reserve composition. This is because USDT briefly traded above $1 while USDC dipped, highlighting that trust in stablecoins now depends as much on real-world performance as the assets backing them.

Title: Northland butchers scoop sausage awards as steak prices bite

The team at Coopers Beach Butchery were the only Northland butchers to take out an overall category prize at this year's Dunninghams Great NZ Sausage Competition. Hand-crafted sausages are smoking past pricey steak as the barbecue go-to this summer – and Northland’s butchers are producing some of the best in the business. The Northern Advocate recently highlighted Omak Meats’ silver medal in the pork category of the 2025 Dunningham’s Great New Zealand Sausage Competition, but has since caught wind that several other Northland butchers also earned top honours. Mangawhai Meat Shop – also known as Klink’s Family Deli – earned two golds for its Free-range Pork and Fennel and Bolognese with Parmesan sausages, and a silver for its Chicken Carbonara. The wins bring the shop’s overall medal tally to 23, including a previous Supreme Award, over the 13 years it’s been entering the national competition. Owner Dan Klink said he was proud that a regional shop with a staff of only five could do so well in a competition that also drew entries from the country’s biggest players. “With over 800 entries from over 110 stores around New Zealand, it’s getting harder and harder to stand out from the rest, but my team and I keep focusing on quality and innovation.” He said sausages were fast becoming the new barbecue staple as meat prices soar. The butchers agreed that beef and lamb prices had increased at least 30% in the past year alone. “People are looking for value, and sausages offer that. They’re more affordable than steak, but when they’re handcrafted like ours, they’re still packed with flavour and quality.” Klink said there might even be a special Christmas snag in the works, possibly incorporating a cranberry and bacon stuffing that the store also sells. Coopers Beach Butchery was the only overall Category Champions in Northland, winning the highest accolade in the pork section – the same category in which Omak Meats won silver. Coopers Beach butcher Gavin Cameron said it was his first time entering the competition since taking ownership of the shop five years ago. However, his winning Blackrock Pork Sausage - named after his previous Auckland business - was the same recipe for which he’d won the Supreme Award back in 2007. “It’s a nod to where we came from and what we’ve built since,” Cameron said. “We’re proud of what we do, and it’s great to see Northland butchers getting the recognition they deserve.” Cameron said the value of a local butcher went far beyond the impersonal experiences of supermarket shopping or a meal kit designed by someone else. “We talk to our customers, we know what they like, and we can help them make the most of what they’re buying,” he said. Butchers could help customers plan a whole meal, still offered cuts supermarkets had long since dropped, and could custom-make products to order. This year was the toughest economically for the industry and for customers, Cameron said. A good sausage was like having a good steak, and at just over $20 kg, the price of two was usually between $5 to $6 - much more affordable than a piece of steak, Cameron said. “And, if the sausage is an award-winning one, handcrafted, you’re going to really taste the difference between it and a massively processed one," he said. Cameron also tied for a bronze medal with Webster Family Butchery in Dargaville, both being recognised for their Roast Lamb and Caramelised Onion recipe. The Dargaville business’s working-owner Kyle Webster, said sausage sales had surged since he reopened the butcher shop about four years ago. “Our sausage sales have increased, probably 50% since we started here, because they’re still affordable when steak and lamb are so expensive.” Webster said he was developing a Wild West Kumara sausage – a mix of beef, spices and kumara – which sells out weekly. While it wasn’t a placegetter in this year’s competition, Webster believed he was on to a future winner. “The problem is we’re so busy here making sausages, we don’t get enough time to actually, you know, tweak and test and add – but I’m going to make time next year," he said. Sarah Curtis is a news reporter for the Northern Advocate, focusing on a wide range of issues. She has nearly 20 years’ experience in journalism, most of which she spent court reporting in Gisborne and on the East Coast. Nearly 30 vehicles were damaged in the blaze on October 21.

Title: In Congress, Former State Treasurers Aim to Manage Budget Better

Riley Moore, R-W.Va. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) George Caldwell / @GCaldwell_news George Caldwell is a journalism fellow at The Daily Signal. Send an email to George. Members of Congress come from all walks of life, but a number of those lawmakers have backgrounds as state financial officers—auditors and treasurers, who determine how states invest and employ their funds. Some prominent Republicans say that background of conservative money management has made them uniquely motivated to curtail Congress’ spending. On Wednesday, the State Financial Officers Foundation, a network of conservative state financial officers, gathered for a panel discussion in Washington to discuss how alumni are applying their experience on the state level toward fiscally conservative legislation in Congress. Rep. Riley Moore is a freshman in the House, but is already in a place of prominence as a member of the Appropriations Committee, which makes decisions on federal spending. Moore, a nephew of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told The Daily Signal that he draws on his experience as state treasurer of West Virginia in his work. “It was hugely beneficial to me when I was making my case to get on Appropriations. I’m the only freshman Republican or Democrat on Appropriations,” he told The Daily Signal. “Had I not had that state financial officer’s background, I’m not sure I’d be on that committee.” During his tenure as treasurer, Moore pursued pro-natural gas policies, such as divesting state pension funds from BlackRock for its use of environmental, social, and governance criteria in making investments. West Virginia’s economy has historically relied on coal and natural gas. He also worked with state legislators on passing legislation to blacklist financial institutions from doing business with the West Virginia government “if their policies conflicted with or boycotted the energy industry.” In Congress, Moore has left his mark on the ongoing appropriations process in a similar way, introducing an amendment into the House’s financial services funding bill to clamp down on credit-rating agencies using ESG criteria, a policy he says has negatively affected his state’s bond rating. As West Virginia’s State Treasurer, I was the first elected official in America to divest my state’s tax dollars from BlackRock that leveraged ESG policies to destroy the fossil fuel industries of my state.Today, my amendment ensures that rating agencies cannot use ESG to… pic.twitter.com/BgXR4PXLbH His amendment would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report on which agencies use ESG criteria in order to assist Congress in addressing the negative effects on states’ finances. Moore also comes from a state that, like many others, has a balanced-budget amendment, meaning the state legislature has to make tough decisions on funding each year, and the state treasurer works within the parameters of those budgets. He says that drives him toward a fiscally conservative approach. “At a state level, obviously we’re always doing more with less. That’s what we do. Right here [in Washington], it’s kind of the opposite,” he said. “I think being able to bring that perspective to the appropriation process is certainly something that’s beneficial, not just to the committee, but I think the country as a whole.” Rep. Jimmy Patronis similarly said it has been a culture shock coming from Florida, which has a balanced-budget amendment, to Congress, which has not passed a balanced budget in a quarter of a century. Patronis was the chief financial officer of Florida before being elected to Congress in a special election to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Matt Gaetz. “The states have been able to be more disciplined, but it’s taken constitutional amendments in those states in order to force some of those policies to be the law of the land,” Patronis told The Daily Signal. “Could we do that in Washington? It’s hard. One thing I’ve learned in Washington: People do enjoy spending money, and I come from a background being a small-business person, where I’m always trying to find ways to create profit, not to spend money,” Patronis said, adding: I’m grateful for what I’ve brought up here to Washington, what I’ve learned, and just hopefully, we can find enough like minds where we can move the needle. One of the most prominent alumni of the State Financial Officers Foundation is Rep. Ron Estes. Estes serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all bills related to taxation originate. He points to his time as Kansas state treasurer, working with limited resources, as a valuable experience. “I think a lot of what you look at, just from a standpoint of what’s the role of government, you look at small, limited government and being able to provide people the opportunity to do what they want to without government dictating what to do,” Estes told The Daily Signal of his experience as state treasurer. He added, “There are some functions and features that a government should do, but let’s make sure that they’re efficient and effective in terms of how we set up them up, how we make them work, how we make them apply to people.” The State Financial Officers Foundation is led by Marlo Oaks, the Utah state treasurer. Oaks told The Daily Signal that he continues to value the connections between the organization and its alumni on Capitol Hill. “It’s really nice to have folks that have been in this role who understand what we’re doing at the state now at the federal level,” said Oaks. But he added that, despite the important action in Washington, officials on the state level play a major role themselves in determining governance. “They’ve clearly played a very significant role during the Biden administration, pushing back against the whole-of-government approach. That was one of the greatest over-exercisings of power in the history of this country … to push an agenda on this country.” Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

In a memo to all Amazon workers, Beth Galetti, the company’s senior vice president of HR, bragged that “some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti beamed. Mileage may vary. The layoffs from earlier this week came hot on the heels of an unprecedented Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that took out a major chunk of the world internet, from Snapchat to ChatGPT. Early financial loss estimates say the damages from that could amount to over half a billion dollars when all the dust settles. Those bad optics were compounded by prior rounds of layoffs over the summer, specifically in AWS’s cloud computing unit, which lost hundreds of employees. In July, AWS CEO Andy Jassy enthused that “generative AI and agents” were changing “the way work is done” in the company’s internet services division — though it remains to be seen if the tech is truly up for the task. And the fun isn’t over yet. Today, users on Downdetector started reporting another AWS outage that they said was affecting airport websites, gaming systems, and “countless internet webpages,” as flagged by The Independent. The disruption even affected Heathrow Airport in London, the UK’s biggest. Even the Scottish Parliament was affected by the turmoil, opting to suspend a voting session due to the network issues. Amazon disputed the outage reports, though — and seemed to suggest that users were blaming it for an outage at Microsoft’s Azure. “There are no issues with AWS services, and all AWS services are operating normally,” it wrote on a status page. “We are aware that an operational issue at another infrastructure provider may be impacting some customers’ applications and networks.” A full postmortem will be up to the internet infrastructure wonks, but Tom‘s Guide noted that Azure and AWS are intertwined in “key ways,” making it hard to diagnose specifically what’s going wrong in real time. The lesson for Amazon is clear, though: successive waves of layoffs as leadership sings the praises of AI to replace workers make AWS an easy target when things break online. “Either way,” Tom’s writes, “for people who rely on Azure- or AWS-backed services, it probably doesn’t matter which one is causing the problem — all that matters is they can’t do what they need to.” More on Amazon: Leaked Document Shows Amazon Scheming to Keep AI Data Center Water Use Secret I’m a tech and transit correspondent for Futurism, where my beat includes transportation, infrastructure, and the role of emerging technologies in governance, surveillance, and labor.

Title: ServiceNow CEO says AI is reorienting the global economy

Every time Alistair publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. AI is reorienting the global economy in radical ways, and the effects are spreading from consumers to companies, says Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, an enterprise software giant. McDermott, a veteran of the software industry who previously led European tech giant SAP, chatted with me as his company reported third-quarter results on Wednesday. We spoke about AI disruptions to the job market, the AI spending boom, and the threat of generative AI to the software industry. The big Amazon layoffs this week have reignited concerns about the impact of this powerful new technology on the job market. McDermott said the economy will certainly undergo fundamental changes due to AI. "AI is going to reorient the global economy," he told me in an interview. Individual consumers have already benefited from this by having access to powerful AI chatbots and models that answer questions in new ways. Next, enterprises, such as companies, governments, and other large organizations, will see gains from this technology, the CEO said. "This is the biggest breakthrough in enterprise technology in half a century," McDermott added. For ServiceNow itself, the CEO said generative AI is encouraging the company to hire more in certain areas, while re-skilling existing staff. "What good is AI if it doesn't serve the greater good of people?" McDermott said. "We use agents in support of our employees, which enable us to hire more people." ServiceNow is hiring "feet on street," which includes salespeople, technology architects and designers, and forward-deployed engineers who can help companies set up new AI and other tech projects in weeks, he said. "And we're retooling and reassessing the skills of every employee, and retraining people to build the workforce of the future," McDermott said. With trillions of dollars being spent on AI infrastructure, I asked the ServiceNow CEO if he's seeing evidence of gains that would justify such heavy spending. "Your point you make is right on," he responded, while saying that most digital transformation projects fail, and 95% of early corporate AI initiatives are not delivering a return on investment. He said ServiceNow has built its software to help companies handle the complexity of new AI projects. "Our platform is that single, clean pane of glass that overcomes digital transformation problems," McDermott said. "It resides above that messy legacy data layer and works across functions and digital processes. No one has time to rip and replace all that legacy mess." ServiceNow shares have been pressured this year by concern about the potential impact of generative AI. Some investors worry that AI coding tools and similar technology could make it easier for companies to build their own software, rather than buying it from software-as-a-service vendors such as ServiceNow. When I asked McDermott whether ServiceNow customers are building their own versions of the company's software, he was unruffled. "No, they can't duplicate what they took 20 years to build," the CEO said. ServiceNow offers enterprise features for IT, operations, employee, customer experience, and engineering on the same product, he said. "That is not what OpenAI and Anthropic, or Gemini, do," he added. "Companies are still running the ServiceNow platform to execute their business missions." ServiceNow delivered another strong quarter, raising its full-year outlook as demand for its AI-powered offerings accelerated. The company's board also approved a five-for-one stock split. The company reported third-quarter subscription revenue of $3.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Revenue reached $3.4 billion, also a 22% increase. ServiceNow raised its 2025 guidance for subscription revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow. McDermott credited the surge to companies accelerating their adoption of ServiceNow's AI capabilities. ServiceNow CFO Gina Mastantuono said that AI products, such as Now Assist, Workflow Data Fabric, and RaptorDB, have exceeded internal plans, showing strong uptake across both new and existing customers. The company highlighted 103 deals worth more than $1 million in net new annual contract value and 553 customers exceeding $5 million. ServiceNow also highlighted the success of its new AI Experience interface and the Zurich product for building scalable AI systems. The company's investments in AI innovation and partnerships, spanning Nvidia, FedEx, and government agencies, show deepening integration of AI into enterprise workflows.

Title: Meta Q3 Profit Tumbles 83% Thanks to ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ Tax Charge

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Excluding the charge, net income would have risen in the quarter as daily active users rose year over year Meta’s third-quarter net profit dropped by 83% due to a tax charge implemented as part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The tech giant generated $51 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 26% from last year, but the net profit plummeted to $2.7 billion due to the charge. Excluding the charge, net income would have been $18.64 billion, up 19% from a year ago. Meta noted in its earnings release that it expects a significant reduction in U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and in the future, but this quarter was significantly affected by a “one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.” Meta, like many other tech giants, has gone all-in on artificial intelligence, and is pouring billions of dollars into developing AI “superintelligence.” The company believes “superintelligence” represents a “paradigm shift” in how computing works and the kind of relationship it will have with its customers, and executives spent a significant chunk of the earnings conference call to discuss its potential. “We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in the earnings release. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.” Meta has a history of exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 2.4% on average. Last quarter the company had its best second quarter to date with revenue of $47.52 billion, outpacing estimates by 6%. The company reported growth in their daily active user base with 3.54 billion visiting one of its apps daily. Meta also noted that it employs 78,450 people as of Sept. 30, an increase of 8% year-over-year. The stock price rose 0.03% to $751.67 in after-hours trading. Here are the key results from Meta’s third quarter report: Revenue: Meta reported $51.24 billion in third quarter sales, up 26% annually, outpacing the $49 billion analysts had projected. Most of the company’s revenue came from advertising. Net income: The company reported $2.71 billion in net income, an 83% drop from the third quarter of 2024 because of tax charges. Excluding the charge, it would’ve been $18.64 billion. Daily active users: Meta’s daily active user base across its apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads increased 8% year-over-year to 3.54 billion users. Earnings Per Share: $7.25, which surpassed the $6.71 estimate EPS analysts projected. This figure is adjusted for the tax charge. Signed into law in July, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act prompted Meta to recognize a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal deferred tax assets. The company had to pay a one-time $15.9 billion charge. While significant, the bill is expected to lower Meta’s future U.S. federal tax payments. The company reported an effective tax rate of 87%. Under the assumption nothing changes in the tax landscape, Meta expects the fourth-quarter tax rate to be 12-15%. Across its family of apps, Meta saw an increase of 14% in ad impressions. On top of that, the average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year. The company expects fourth-quarter total revenue to be in the range of $56-59 billion. Meta expects the full-year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion reflecting a growth rate of 20-24% year-over-year. Reality Labs — Meta’s division focused on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality technology – lost $4.43 billion in the third quarter. The previous quarter the company lost $4.53 billion on the effort. Meta said the anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to the introduction of Quest 3S in the fourth quarter of last year and the Quest headsets hitting the retail market during the third quarter of this year to prepare for the holiday season. The Meta CEO said Instagram has 3 billion monthly active users, and the company’s text-based platform Threads has 150 million daily actives users. Both Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li expressed excitement in Meta’s generative AI video platform Vibes. Li noted that users have generated over 20 billion images using Meta’s products since launching Vibes in September. The company has seen media generation in the app increase more than tenfold. Zuckerberg added that over a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis. Zuckerberg expressed continued interest in superintelligence, a level of AI that would match or surpass human-level understanding. Though the CEO did not have specific details on the lab’s advancement, he said they are “heads down developing our next generation of models and products” in order to be the leading frontier AI Lab. “Our approach of advancing open source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits,” he said. “Meta superintelligence Labs is off to a strong start. I think that we’ve already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry.” “The company that is the best at each of these capabilities will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that,” Zuckerberg added of Meta’s strategy in forwarding AI implementation. “I’m not sure that any one company is going to be the best at all of them, but what we’re trying to do is to not do some things that others have done. We’re really trying to build novel capabilities, and I’m keeping this high level.” The CEO was coy about the details of Meta’s AI advancements, only noting that they would eventually bolster its existing platforms and services while unlocking new business opportunities.

Title: Amazon Games Division Faces ‘Significant’ Job Cuts Amid 14,000 Layoffs: Report

Amazon is making sweeping cuts across its video game division as part of a larger round of layoffs affecting more than 14,000 corporate employees, according to Bloomberg. A company memo sent out on Tuesday confirmed “significant role reductions” in its Games unit, particularly affecting offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division. The move follows Amazon’s announcement earlier this week that it will eliminate 14,000 corporate roles as part of broader “organizational changes,” giving most affected employees 90 days to find new roles internally. Steve Boom, Amazon’s Vice President of Audio, Twitch, and Games, said in the memo that the company is “leaning into the things that Amazon does best.” That includes scaling back development on big-budget titles — especially massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) — and focusing instead on smaller, cloud-based and AI-driven projects. The company’s Montreal studio will continue developing March of Giants, a strategy title, while external partners like Crystal Dynamics and Maverick Games remain at work on a new Tomb Raider game and a racing title, respectively. Amazon’s cloud gaming platform, Luna, will also continue to receive new “casual and AI-focused” games. The company recently relaunched Luna in Canada with a major overhaul, featuring an updated interface, new multiplayer options, and free games for Prime members, all playable across nearly any device without a console. Amazon’s retreat from big-budget games comes as it sunsets New World: Aeternum, its ambitious MMO that peaked at more than 900,000 concurrent players when it launched in 2021. The company said the recently released Nighthaven update will serve as the game’s final content drop, with servers remaining online through 2026. The changes mark another reset for Amazon’s decade-long push into gaming, which has produced only a handful of notable hits. In its blog post announcing the end of development for New World, the company acknowledged: “We’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.” As Amazon tightens its focus around Luna and smaller-scale experiences, it’s clear the company is taking a more conservative approach to gaming — one centred on long-term efficiency rather than blockbuster ambition.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One woman is processing being laid off while on a tropical vacation. Another's "get ready with me" video turned sour after she said she'd learned her fate. With as many as 14,000 Amazon employees set to lose their jobs, some workers who said they were laid off by the e-commerce company are posting through it on social media. Several of them are sharing updates in real time as they process their feelings about the reductions. The person who posted the "get ready with me" video, for example, had planned to take her followers along with her for a morning run when she said he learned she was affected by the cuts. "I no longer have a job to go to after I go running," the TikToker said in one of her videos. Get ready with me to go to work!!! Except I got laid off this morning! Shoutout to you Amazon🤍🤍 I’m about to be poor so please donate to my charity link pinned to the comments!!!!! #amazon #layoffs #fyp A few others are posting almost hourly updates on how they're doing since the cuts were announced. One user, who said she's on vacation in Mauritius, posted a video two hours after she said she learned she was laid off. She said it was "divine intervention." "I'm not freaking out," she said. "I'm also still very much in shock." #techlayoffs #amazon Others don't seem to be taking it so well. One TikTok creator who said she worked at Amazon told followers on Tuesday, when the company announced the layoffs, to place bets on whether she'd be affected. The next day, she said she'd been let go after more than eight years at the company. Since then, her updates have been a mix of jokes, including telling her cats the news, and crying videos. One of her videos has gone viral, with nearly 200,000 views in less than 24 hours. Amazon layoff breakdown begins Some posts were bittersweet. One person who said their Amazon Games studio was affected said they would work with their team again "in a heartbeat." Just got laid off from Amazon Games San Diego(including like 99% of the studio), the team I worked with was incredible and I will miss all of them. If I had the opportunity to work with them again I would take it in a heartbeat! Others hit the ground running on LinkedIn, changing their status on the professional networking platform to "#OpenToWork" and asking connections for leads on open positions. On Reddit, dozens of people have begun crowdsourcing a list of affected roles and divisions to determine which areas were hit the hardest. Posting through the pain of being laid off isn't a new concept. Many people, specifically Gen Zers, have gone viral in posts about losing their jobs. It's all about validating their feelings about being fired and seeking human connection, one workplace researcher told Business Insider in 2024. Amazon declined to comment on the social media posts. This week, one woman said she was working in her "dream role" as a social media manager at Amazon before being laid off less than a month after celebrating her one-year anniversary in the position and a week before her birthday. Today I was laid off at Amazon | Day 1 of LEA AFTER LAYOFF #amazon #layoffs #corporatelife "I guess my present from Amazon came a little bit early," she said in the clip. Jump to

Title: As Amazon's game business crumbles, the public is surprised to discover that it was trying to compete with Steam all this time

If you're wondering how it all went so wrong, former VP Ethan Evans might be able to shed some light on things. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. September 30, 2016 was a big day for Amazon Game Studios: It was on that day, at TwitchCon, it unveiled Breakaway, Crucible, and New World, signalling a major push into the realm of big-budget game development. Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright. And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end: Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours) but active development is over. Various other whiffs have been interspersed throughout—failed games, forgotten game stores, that sort of thing—but for me, the fates of those three games really encapsulate Amazon's gaming misadventure: Big talk, half-assed execution, ugly endings, all of it leading to yesterday's announcement of major layoffs at Amazon Games. Of course there's no single answer to the question of what the hell went wrong, because obviously a lot of things did. But the end of New World, and seemingly of Amazon's gaming ambitions as a whole, bring to mind what former Prime Gaming vice president Ethan Evans had to say about it earlier this year—essentially, that hubris and money are a dangerous combination. Amazon's overarching goal, according to a LinkedIn post we reported on in February, was to "disrupt the game platform Steam." No problemo, right? As Evans wrote on LinkedIn, "We were at least 250x bigger [than Steam]," and that's a pretty good starting point. Ah, but problemo indeed. "The 15+ year long attempt to challenge Steam started before I was VP of Prime Gaming, but we never cracked the code," Evans wrote. "Not under my leadership or anyone else's." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Twitch tried to break into the digital marketplace via acquisition, and failed; then it tried to build its own storefront into Twitch, which was also a bust. Then it built the cloud gaming service Luna, which went largely unnoticed. Steam, meanwhile, continued its uncontested dominance of PC gaming, ably guided by Gabe Newell and a potato. "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits," Evans admitted in his February LinkedIn post. "We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available. "We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either. Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it." The extent of Amazon's failure to crack the Steam nut is revealed in the fact that not only did it fail to compete, but lots of people didn't even know it was trying in the first place. That's, uhh, really not a good sign. Today I learned amazon had a platform competing against Steam. lol Amazon: "you took everything from me" Steam: Amazon was OFFICIALLY competing against Steam this whole time? I’ve had steam since it was a thing, and this is quite literally the first time I’ve heard they have a game store Like I knew about New World or whatever their MMORPG was but that’s it. Amazon isn't giving up on games entirely, but it's shifting focus away from major productions like New World to stuff like the AI-powered Snoop Dogg game where he's a judge. I'm sure that'll work out much better. Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: Markets Tumble After Fed Lowers Interest Rates—But Powell Won’t Promise Another Cut

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lower interest rates for the second straight month, but the broader market reacted negatively after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested an additional cut may not come later this year. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 in favor of easing interest rates by a quarter-point to between 3.75% and 4%, down from the 4% to 4.25% range policymakers opted for during the FOMC’s meeting last month. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Fed Governor Stephen Miran were the lone dissenting votes: Miran again pushed for a half-point reduction after dissenting in September’s vote, while Schmid preferred the Fed not lower rates at all. In its statement, the FOMC held its review of the labor market, which notes that “job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August.” The Fed appeared to acknowledge the ongoing federal government shutdown, adding “available indicators” suggest the U.S. economy has expanded at a moderate pace and that inflation has “moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement that policymakers had “strongly differing views” about how to proceed in the FOMC’s last meeting in December. A further reduction to interest rates is “not a foregone conclusion,” Powell said, “Far from it.” Powell noted that while some government data has been delayed, public and private sector data that have remained available suggest employment and inflation have “not changed much” since the FOMC met last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 0.2%) and S&P 500 (0.3%) dropped on the day after Powell’s statements, paring back earlier gains on the day largely driven by Nvidia’s record-setting surge, which has held up the tech-heavy Nasdaq (up 0.1%) so far. Boeing (4.3%) headlined declines across the Dow, followed by Nike (3.1%), UnitedHealth Group (3%) and Home Depot (2%). Investors are favoring an additional quarter-point reduction to interest rates at the FOMC’s last meeting in December, potentially lowering rates to between 3.5% and 3.75%, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. In its meeting last month, Fed officials appeared to be divided over whether to cut rates for a third time this year. It’s unclear when the Fed will have insight into the U.S. economy’s health, however, as an ongoing federal government shutdown has postponed reports on inflation and unemployment. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supported the FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy, indicating his focus had shifted to a “softening” labor market instead of inflation. Waller said that, because policymakers “don’t know which way the data will break on this conflict,” the FOMC would “need to move with care” when adjusting interest rates. Waller noted he has spoken with “business contacts” to form his outlook on the economy while a data blackout continues. Reports released from several firms and economists in recent weeks suggest the labor market has continued to deteriorate, suggesting the FOMC could have data to support an additional cut. Whether Trump names his pick to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May 2026, by the end of the year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said five candidates are under consideration for the role, including Fed governors Waller, Michelle Bowman, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. Bessent said he would present a list of candidates to Trump shortly after Thanksgiving.

Title: Former World of Warcraft and League of Legends MMO lead says replacing devs with AI is "a little bit premature" - "AI may one day accelerate game development. But it's not happening today"

"All of these layoffs are just to cut opex and make the stock prices go up. It will lead to empty portfolios for the next few years" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A former Blizzard and Riot Games lead developer says there may come a time when AI can competently displace human game developers, but that day is not today. Over on Twitter, Greg Street, who was lead systems designer on World of Warcraft from 2008 to 2013, and then filled various lead roles at Riot Games including executive producer on the League of Legends MMO until 2023, touched on the harrowing topic of AI and its capabilities in the game dev space. "AI may one day accelerate game development. But it's not happening today," said Street. "All of these layoffs are just to cut opex and make the stock prices go up. It will lead to empty portfolios for the next few years." Street was seemingly responding to this week's mass layoffs at Amazon, the gutting of Amazon Games, and the ending of new development on the studio's fantasy MMO, New World. In a follow-up tweet, he commented, "I'm sorry for my friends at Amazon who were trying to keep the MMO dream alive." Further reflecting on the seemingly unending downsizing in the games industry, Street said: "I mean layoffs happen for lots of reasons. But if a company is claiming they don't need workers because AI is going to make their games or movies or books today, that's a little premature. (It's better at music.)" It definitely feels like generative AI hasn't reached a point where it can make mechanically and narratively compelling games, although I take great issue with the suggestion that AI music is anything other than auditory torture. Still, in response to a commenter, Street predicted AI will soon "be able to do terrain or say a billion weapon variants," but argued "it's a long way from being able to tell cohesive stories (but that doesn't mean decades either)." Counterpoint: Take-Two CEO says AI is "going to be really, really bad" at making video games and probably couldn't even come up with the GTA 6 marketing plan Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more After earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side.

Title: Meta Earnings: How Will Its AI And Metaverse Investments Perform?

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $796.25/share and is currently trading near $746. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $6.61/share on $49.34 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $7.21/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78. In 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. In 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $28.29 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $30.19. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 27 which is around the same (1x) the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting strong and is building a new bullish base after recently hitting a fresh record high. Currently, the stock is trading around 6% below its all-time high which is bullish considering it was down double digits from its record high earlier this year. Near-term support is the 50 day moving average (DMA) line and then the 200 DMA line. The stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been previously featured as a leading stock on my stock market membership site: FindLeadingStocks.com

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We've been hearing that AI is coming for our jobs for years. Is it finally happening now? Maybe. We're now seeing a slew of big companies ditching thousands of jobs, citing AI as an animating rationale. This week, for instance, Amazon said it was cutting 14,000 white-collar jobs, arguing that it can and should be leaner in an AI age. In July, Microsoft said the same when it got rid of 9,000 jobs. IBM says it has replaced hundreds of workers with AI. And all of that may certainly be true. On the other hand: Again. I don't doubt that AI is being used in various ways, across multiple industries, and that those uses will grow. (I now routinely use ChatGPT to help me research and structure stories like the one you're reading now. While we're here: Axel Springer, the company that owns Business Insider, has a partnership with OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT.) And it would make plenty of sense for a company that thinks it's going to replace workers with software to move to do that in advance, instead of getting around to it after the fact. But inevitability is different from reality. I've been through enough layoff waves to know that rationales change … all the time. Chances are you know this, too. They evolution of layoff season #corporate #corporatelife #techtok #layoffs #layoff So maybe AI really is taking away jobs now. Maybe it's just getting the blame.

By Nellie Andreeva Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV Jill Arthur, EVP TV Development and Production, is among the executives leaving Fifth Season as part of the layoffs at the independent studio, which impacted 10% of its staff, Deadline has learned. Fifth Season has been looking for a new head of television following the fall 2024 departure of Joe Hipps. Arthur and fellow EVP Noah Greenshner have been the most senior television executives at the company in the interim, with Greenshner staying on as the search continues. Arthur joined Fifth Season in 2022. Before that, she was a Senior Development and Programming Executive at Amazon Studios where she worked across comedy and drama on projects including The Power, Expats, Hanna, With Love, The Wilds, The Tick, Red Oaks, Catastrophe and Forever. She previously worked at Jerry Weintraub Productions, including early development of Westworld for HBO, and started her career as an agent at ICM. Watch on Deadline As Deadline exclusively reported Tuesday, Fifth Season has pink-slipped fewer than 20 staffers in its overall 160-employee count as part of the layoffs. The news of cuts comes in the wake of Chris Rice departing Fifth Season as co-CEO in September. His longtime partner, fellow co-CEO Graham Taylor, became Fifth Season’s sole CEO. Rice inked a first-look production deal with Fifth Season and remains an adviser to the company. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Title: US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as labour market weakens

On Wednesday, the US central bank announced its second rate cut of the year. By Andy Hirschfeld Share Save The United States Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75-4.00 percent, amid signs of a slowing labour market and continued pressure on consumer prices. The cut, announced on Wednesday, marks the US central bank’s second rate cut this year. “Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” the Fed said in a statement. “Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated.” The cuts were largely in line with expectations. Earlier on Wednesday, CME FedWatch — which tracks the likelihood of rate cuts — said there was a 97.8 percent probability of rate cuts. After the September cut, economists had largely been expecting two additional rate cuts for the rest of this year. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley, among others, forecast one more 25-basis-point reduction by year’s end following Wednesday’s cut. Bank of America Global Research is the only major firm that is not anticipating another 25-basis-point cut in 2025. “The Fed has a challenging line to walk; lower interest rates to support labour markets and growth, or raise them to tamp down inflation. For now, they are taking a cautious approach tilted a bit towards the growth concerns,” Michael Klein, professor of international economic affairs at The Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told Al Jazeera. Despite forecasts, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said another rate cut isn’t necessarily inevitable. “We haven’t made a decision about December,” Powell told reporters in a press conference, referring to the next rate decision meeting of the Fed. “We remain well-positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.” The cuts come as economic data becomes increasingly scarce amid the ongoing government shutdown, now in its 29th day as of Wednesday, making it the second-longest in US history, behind the 35-day shutdown during the first presidency of Donald Trump in late 2018 and early 2019. Because of the shutdown, the Department of Labor did not release the September jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3. The only major government economic data released this month was the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the cost of goods and services and is a key measure of inflation. The CPI rose 0.3 percent in September on a month-over-month basis to an inflation rate of 3 percent. That data was released because the Social Security Administration required it to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for 2026. As a result, Social Security beneficiaries will receive a 2.8 percent increase in payments compared to 2025. The shutdown, however, could have a bigger impact on next month’s central bank decision as the Labor Department is currently unable to compile the data needed for its November reports. However, amid the limited government data, private trackers are showing a slowdown. “We are not going to be able to have the detailed feel of things, but I think if there were a significant or material change in the economy one way or another, I think we would pick that up,” Powell said. Consumer confidence fell to a six-month low, according to The Conference Board’s report that was released on Tuesday. The data showed that lower-income earners – those making less than $75,000 a year – are less confident about the economy as fears of job scarcity loom. This comes only days after several large corporations announced waves of layoffs. On Wednesday, Paramount cut 2,000 people from its workforce. On Tuesday, Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs. Last week, big box retailer Target cut 1,800 jobs. This comes as furloughs and layoffs weigh on government workers. The US government is the nation’s largest employer. Those making more than $200,000 annually remain fairly confident and are leading consumer spending that is keeping the economy afloat, according to The Conference Board. Pressures both on consumer spending and the labour market are largely driven by tariffs weighing on consumers and businesses. US markets are lower on the rate cut. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down by about 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq is about even with the market open as of 3pm in New York (19:00 GMT). Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Federal Reserve Cuts Key Rate As Government Shutdown Clouds Economic Outlook

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year as it seeks to shore up economic growth and hiring, even as inflation stays elevated. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell also cautioned that further rate cuts weren’t guaranteed, citing the government shutdown’s interruption of economic reports and sharp divisions among 19 Fed officials who participate in the central bank’s interest-rate deliberations. Speaking to reporters after the Fed announced its rate decision, Powell said there were “strongly differing views about how to proceed in December” at its next meeting and a further reduction in the benchmark rate is not “a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The rate cut — a quarter of a point — brings the Fed’s key rate down to about 3.9%, from about 4.1%. The central bank had cranked its rate to roughly 5.3% in 2023 and 2024 to combat the biggest inflation spike in four decades before implementing three cuts last year. Lower rates could, over time, reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as for business loans. The move comes amid a fraught time for the central bank, with hiring sluggish and yet inflation stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Compounding its challenges, the central bank is navigating without the economic signposts it typically relies on from the government, including monthly reports on jobs, inflation, and consumer spending, which have been suspended because of the government shutdown. Federal Reserve issues #FOMC statement: https://t.co/PN2waoTZrP Financial markets largely expected another rate reduction in December, and stock prices dropped after Powell’s comments, with the S&P 500 nearly unchanged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing slightly lower. “Powell poured cold water on the idea that the Fed was on autopilot for a December cut,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. “Instead, they’ll have to wait for economic data to confirm that a rate cut is actually needed.” Powell was asked about the impact of the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 and has interrupted the distribution of economic data. Powell said the Fed does have access to some data that give it “a picture of what’s going on.” He added that, “If there were a significant or material change in the economy, one way or another, I think we’d pick that up through this.” But the Fed chair did acknowledge that the limited data could cause officials to proceed more cautiously heading into its next meeting in mid-December. “There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving (on rates). I’m not committing to that, I’m just saying it’s certainly a possibility that you would say ‘we really can’t see, so let’s slow down.’” The Fed typically raises its short term rate to combat inflation, while it cuts rates to encourage borrowing and spending and shore up hiring. Right now it sees risks of both slowing hiring and rising inflation, so it is reducing borrowing costs to support the job market, while still keeping rates high enough to avoid stimulating the economy so much that it worsens inflation. Yet Powell suggested the Fed increasingly sees inflation as less of a threat. He noted that excluding the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, inflation is “not so far from our 2% goal.” Inflation has slowed in apartment rents and for many services, such as car insurance. A report released last week showed that inflation remains elevated but isn’t accelerating. The government recalled employees to produce the report, despite the shutdown, because it was used to calculate the cost of living adjustment for Social Security. At the same time, the economy could be rebounding from a sluggish first half, which could improve job growth in the coming months, Powell said. That would make rate cuts less necessary. “For some part of the committee, it’s time to maybe take a step back and see if whether there really are downside risks to the labor market,” Powell said. “Or see whether in fact that the stronger growth that we’re seeing is real.” Two of the 12 officials who vote on the Fed’s rate decisions dissented Wednesday, but in different directions. Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against the move because he preferred no change to the Fed’s rate. Schmid has previously expressed concern that inflation remains too high. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented for the second straight meeting in favor of a half-point cut. Miran was appointed by President Donald Trump just before the central bank’s last meeting in September. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not reducing borrowing costs more quickly. In South Korea early Wednesday he repeated his criticisms of the Fed chair. “He’s out of there in another couple of months,” Trump said. Powell’s term ends in May. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the administration is considering five people to replace Powell, and will decide by the end of this year. The Fed also said Wednesday that it would stop reducing the size of its massive securities holdings, which it accumulated during the pandemic and after the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The change, to take effect Dec. 1, could over time slightly reduce longer-term interest rates on things like mortgages but won’t have much overall impact on consumer borrowing costs. Without government data, the economy is harder to track, Powell said. September’s jobs report, scheduled to be released three weeks ago, is still postponed. This month’s hiring figures, to be released Nov. 7, will likely be delayed and may be less comprehensive when finally released. And the White House said last week that October’s inflation report may never be issued at all. Before the government shutdown cut off the flow of data, monthly hiring gains had weakened to an average of just 29,000 a month for the previous three months, according to the Labor Department’s data. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The government shutdown puts millions at risk of losing food assistance — and Trump and lawmakers are MIA.

Title: Federal Reserve Lowers Interest Rates Again
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/10/29/federal-reserve-lowers-interest-rates-again/

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lower interest rates again, the second straight month the central bank eased monetary policy after months of pressure and criticism from President Donald Trump, who has called for steeper cuts. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 in favor of easing interest rates by a quarter-point to between 3.75% and 4%, down from the 4% to 4.25% range policymakers opted for during the FOMC’s meeting last month. Investors are favoring an additional quarter-point reduction to interest rates at the FOMC’s last meeting in December, potentially lowering rates to between 3.5% and 3.75%, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. In its meeting last month, Fed officials appeared to be divided over whether to cut rates for a third time this year. It’s unclear when the Fed will have insight into the U.S. economy’s health, however, as an ongoing federal government shutdown has postponed reports on inflation and unemployment. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supported the FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy, indicating his focus had shifted to a “softening” labor market instead of inflation. Waller said that, because policymakers “don’t know which way the data will break on this conflict,” the FOMC would “need to move with care” when adjusting interest rates. Waller noted he has spoken with “business contacts” to form his outlook on the economy while a data blackout continues. Reports released from several firms and economists in recent weeks suggest the labor market has continued to deteriorate, suggesting the FOMC could have data to support an additional cut. Whether Trump names his pick to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026, by the end of the year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said five candidates are under consideration for the role, including Fed governors Waller, Michelle Bowman, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. Bessent said he would present a list of candidates to Trump shortly after Thanksgiving.

Title: What To Know About President Trump’s Cognitive Test
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2025/10/29/what-to-know-about-president-trumps-cognitive-test/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T18:00:22Z

ByAmy Feldman, Forbes Staff andAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at President Trump’s cognitive test, Nvidia’s collaborations in life sciences and drug development, Cobot’s hospital robots, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. President Trump told reporters Monday that he had aced a cognitive test, comparing himself favorably to two younger Democrats, both of whom are non-white women. “The first couple of questions are easy. A tiger, an elephant, a giraffe, you know. When you get up to about five or six, and then when you get up to 10 and 20 and 25, they couldn’t come close to answering any of those questions,” he said. Trump, 79, appeared to be referring to a 10-minute test known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, commonly used to detect mild cognitive decline and early signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. These tests are not given routinely in the general public, but are typically administered to adults who may be experiencing memory problems or to those whose family members are concerned about them. Donald Trump’s father, Fred Trump, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, which has a genetic component. In his comments this week, Trump also said that he underwent an MRI, claiming that “it was perfect,” but did not identify the reason for it or whether it was related to the cognitive test. Brain MRIs can be used to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and to track their progression, but Trump did not give details about the MRI and there are numerous other body parts that could be scanned and reasons that they’re done. The White House did not respond to questions about the MRI or cognitive exam. This isn’t the first time that Trump has bragged about acing a cognitive test. Back in 2020, Trump notably went on television to talk about how he remembered a group of five words – Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV – in the right order. The appearance spawned memes and swag emblazoned with the five words. For decades, there has been discussion both within the White House medical team and the broader medical community about how presidents should be evaluated for office, cognitively as well as physically, former White House physician Jeffrey Kuhlman wrote in a New York Times op-ed last year. “While nearly all physical difficulties can be accommodated, cognitive impairments are a different issue,” Kuhlman wrote. “A president must be in top mental shape to evaluate a complex situation, form a plan, consider the alternatives and possible consequences to a decision, and then provide definitive directives in a timely manner.” Tech giant Nvidia, which became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market cap today, announced a series of partnerships this week with healthcare companies to use AI for drug development and in the life sciences. One major development: pharma giant Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the two are calling an “AI factory.” This supercomputer, built on more than 1,000 of Nvidia’s chips, will operate out of Lilly’s existing data center in Indianapolis. This machine will build new AI drug discovery models based on Lilly’s proprietary data and will also be tasked with automating manufacturing and optimizing clinical trials. Other collaborations include ones with Alphabet subsidiary Verily, which will integrate Nvidia’s AI tech into its precision health platform Pre; with Johnson & Johnson, which will use Nvidia's AI models to help train its surgical robots; and with Innovaccer, which is partnering with the tech giant to accelerate development of multimodal AI models for healthcare. Nvidia is also increasing its work with academic partners to use AI to advance life sciences research, including with more open source research models. These include CodonFM, used to develop RNA medicines; La-Proteina, which generates 3D protein structures; and a trio of models used for medical imaging. It also expanded its collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to develop virtual cell models that can be used by the scientific community. Novartis agreed to buy Avidity Biosciences for $12 billion to get its dystrophy drugs, now in late-stage trials. The deal is the second-largest biotech acquisition of the year, behind only J&J’s $14.6 billion purchase of central- nervous system drugmaker Intra-Cellular Therapies in January. Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan justified the price on an investor call Monday, saying that if the firm had waited for data, the size of the deal could have been “potentially twice as big.” Also: London-based GHO Capital raised $2.9 billion for a new healthcare fund focused on biopharma, medtech, life sciences tools and other areas of healthcare. The new capital brings GHO’s assets to some $10.5 billion, which it says makes it Europe’s largest healthcare-focused private equity firm. Plus: BridgeBio reported success in a second late-stage study for its therapy for a rare endocrine disorder and the FDA approved expanding the label for Merck’s potential blockbuster Winrevair to include its ability to reduce patients' risk of hospitalization and death from pulmonary arterial hypertension. AI pharma company Recursion received its second milestone payment of $30 million from partners Roche and Genentech for developing a whole-genome map of microglial immune cells. These are resident in the central nervous system, and the hope is that this information will provide new potential drug targets for a wide range of neurological disorders. The payment is part of a deal, worth up to $12 billion, that Recursion struck with the two drug companies in 2021. Plus: Curve Biosciences, which is building a digital “atlas” of the human body based on its collection of tissues from multiple organs and disease states, raised $40 million in funding led by life sciences investor Luma Group to commercialize its software to enable diagnosis and monitoring of chronic diseases. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company was valued at $35 million last year, according to PitchBook; it declined to disclose its current valuation. Brad Porter, who helped Amazon deploy an army of more than 500,000 warehouse robots, founded Collaborative Robots, or Cobot, three and half years ago to push more robots out into the world. One early customer (and investor): Mayo Clinic. Moving stuff at hospitals is an ordeal that takes lots of time and manpower, and the fast-paced environment of a hospital can lead to clogged hallways and delayed surgeries. “There’s a lot of material movement in hospitals and it’s done 24/7, and hospitals struggle to find enough staffing to do all of it,” Porter told Forbes. To start, he said, Cobot’s robots can move linen carts and food carts, and get surgical tools to the sterilization room and back. The Santa Clara, California-based company, which has raised $140 million from investors that include Sequoia, Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst, as well as Mayo Clinic, doesn’t just focus on hospitals. It has also worked with shipping giant Maersk, vaccine maker Moderna and healthcare logistics firm Owens & Minor. This is the unsexy side of robots, but the potential impact on hospitals, where profit margins are tight, could be game changing. “If you are a surgeon and you know you have a back-to-back schedule all day, and the surgical tools don’t make it from sterilization in time, your procedure is set back 15 minutes. On a human level, that causes a little anxiety and adrenaline,” Porter said. “If we can make it very smooth, then everything gets done very efficiently. That’s one of the lessons that we learned at Amazon.” Plus: Surgeons removed a genetically modified pig kidney from a patient nine months transplant. That’s the longest time such a kidney has lasted in a human patient. (Forbes spoke with the CEO of biotech startup eGenesis, which provided the kidney, last year about its technology and plans.) The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which helps determine vaccine policy, was hit by widespread layoffs at the agency, according to The Guardian. The working groups that analyze data and help draw up ACIP’s agendas have reportedly not met for months, and a scheduled October meeting has been indefinitely postponed due to the government shutdown. If the federal government does not make key vaccine recommendations for children next year, families may not be reimbursed by insurance companies or qualify for social programs. Plus: Texas sues Tylenol maker Kenvue alleging it deceived mothers about the risks associated with autism. The suit follows official warnings by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that acetaminophen is a potential cause for autism. Scientific research to date does not suggest a causal link. UnitedHealthcare may lose two-thirds of Obamacare enrollees after double-digit price hikes caused by Congress failing to extend premium subsidies. These subsidies are at the heart of the dispute over the current government shutdown. More than one-third of Eli Lilly’s new prescriptions for its weight-loss drug Zepbound are coming from its direct-to-consumer program, LillyDirect. Diptheria, a deadly disease for children, is resurgent in Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Chad. HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy, Jr. is directing the CDC to investigate health harms of offshore wind farms, despite no indication any exist. AI models are able to diagnose certain kinds of brain cancers faster and more cheaply than current molecular testing, according to a new study. Tom Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, pledged to give $253 million to six children’s hospitals around the country and form an alliance among them. Citing Donald Trump’s executive order on the “biological reality of sex,” the Veteran’s Administration will make it more difficult for male veterans to obtain coverage for breast cancer treatments, despite the fact that this cancer is typically more deadly for men than women. The FDA issued new draft guidance today proposing updates to the regulatory process for biosimilar drugs, aiming to accelerate their approval in order to reduce drug costs for patients.

New World will remain playable through 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon has ended development on New World, the company's big fantasy MMO. Season 10 is the last round of updates the game will receive, as some 14,000 jobs are impacted by layoffs across Amazon Games. As you might imagine, many of the large-scale action-RPG's players are feeling a mixture of emotions at this announcement, anger and sadness being two major ones. Some of them have poured hours into Aeternum, making friends and forging deep bonds through the game. One such player, who clocked an incredible 13,000 hours exploring, foraging and battling in the rich, fantastical landscape, wrote an impassioned Reddit post expressing their sorrow. "I can't even find the motivation to play. I think what's going on is unbelievably sad. And I'm feeling more than a little morose," they state. Coming less than a month after the Nighthaven expansion makes this "extra hard to take," as they lament what seemed like real hope for the project’s future. "New World was back. The game was alive," they say, before thanking everyone involved, especially the players: "The game is nothing without us." Their sentiment is shared in the Steam reviews, which are dragging New World's standing on Valve’s store into the gutter. "Amazon just stabbed it in the back," writes one New World-er who managed 100 hours over the course of a month. "Shame on you Amazon," says another. "Never trust Amazon Games," a third reviewer adds, and on and on. Lots of people are feeling a little betrayed by the decision, sudden as it seems, since there appeared to be more genuine investment going into making this a long-term release. New World’s servers will remain active through 2026, and there'll be at least six months for any decisions made otherwise, according to the announcement blog post. Sadly, this doesn't appear to make it any less painful.

Title: Why insurer Nationwide is investing $1.5 billion through 2028 on AI and other tech initiatives

Time Published: 2025-10-29T17:44:26Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Almost half of Nationwide’s 22,000 employees are using Microsoft Copilot and other artificial intelligence tools every day. The insurer’s wants that number to hit 90% by 2026. To make this lofty target a reality, the property and casualty insurance company on Wednesday announced it would invest $1.5 billion through 2028 to support technology innovation initiatives, including $100 million that will be earmarked to advance AI each year for the next three years. The AI spending will go toward creating and managing AI assistants that will take on more work tasks, training and education, software development, and the underlying infrastructure to ensure that the AI systems that Nationwide relies on are resilient and secure. Jim Fowler, Nationwide’s chief technology officer, says that the new financial commitment represents a 20% increase from what the company has been spending on an annual basis “in the last couple of years.” Since 2015, Nationwide says that it has invested $5 billion in technology modernization. It is also indicative of a strategic pivot of Nationwide’s AI Playbook. Four months ago, Fowler says the company’s leadership met and wasn’t pleased to see dozens of AI use cases had proliferated across the organization. While workers were getting more efficient, it wasn’t always clear how they should use their extra time. Ten of Nationwide’s C-suite leaders worked collaboratively to identify 18 flagship AI use cases to prioritize across the business. “We stepped back and we said, ‘We’ve got to get out of experimentation mode,’” says Fowler. A few of the flagship AI use cases that Nationwide will be focusing on include a tool that will automate 80% of pets claims, including the resolution of 25% of those claims with an instant settlement. Fowler says this application of AI will create more capacity for the operations team to hunt down new business. For the farm and agricultural insurance business, AI tools are expected to reduce the review time for those claims by 20%. In recent months, CTOs and chief information officers have pivoted their investment strategies to focus on fewer bets tied to bigger business outcomes. This new approach could help them finally achieve a steadier return on their AI investments, which has proven to be difficult to achieve as enterprises near the three-year mark since the debut of ChatGPT. “Part of what we’re doing differently, that I see other companies doing, is we’re setting targets that are the ROI,” says Fowler. “And those targets are big enough that even if we don’t get to the full target, we will still be wildly happy with the outcome.” That includes an efficiency target for Fowler’s own software employees. His goal is to use more AI coding assistant tools to cut the cycle time to write new software by 50%. “I’ve got no shortage in the backlog of demand for technology,” says Fowler, especially given this week’s big new IT investment. Nationwide, which ranks 72 on the Fortune 500, says it has already scaled six AI initiatives. Those tools include a generative AI claims assistant that can summarize the log notes of complex customer claims. When a claims representative gets in touch with a customer to discuss a large reported loss, it gets a one-paragraph summary to bring them up to speed on the case. An AI-enabled tool is also being used by developers to help migrate legacy code to new platforms. Fowler says that this tool has driven a 50% reduction in code conversion time for Nationwide’s development teams. That solution was developed during one of Nationwide’s hackathon events. Already, AI chatbots and other productivity tools have been embraced by some early AI adopters. Nationwide says it has identified around 1,000 employees who had made themselves more productive using AI. While the company wants to continue to encourage that usage, Nationwide also wants to focus more energy and dollars on the flagship ideas. “What we saw is that with all the experimentation that was going on over the last two-and-a-half years, nothing was scaling,” says Fowler. “I don’t want to take away from the associates the ability to kind of drive their own local productivity, but I want to be more intentional about where we’re going to get scale for bigger solutions.” Next week, Fowler says that Nationwide will host a symposium for roughly 1,000 employees who have an associate vice president title or above. The company will tap the expertise of both internal and external speakers to talk through expectations for how technology, including AI, will improve operations and the future strategy for every business unit. These bigger bets on AI from have raised questions about the future of work and surveys have shown workers are worried that they’ll be displaced by the technology. Just this week, Amazon announced it will cut about 14,000 jobs as it accelerates spending on AI. But AI may not necessarily be a job killer at Nationwide. Fowler says that the company’s sales have grown 50% over the last five years and “we’re really not expecting that to slow down.” His hope is that AI and other innovative technologies will make it easier to generate more business. “This isn’t just an efficiency play,” explains Fowler. “AI is not just about productivity.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Amazon to cut 14,000 corporate jobs amid AI push. Mere months after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that efficiency gains from AI would mean fewer jobs, the tech giant announced a fresh round of layoffs that will reportedly span various departments including logistics, payments, video games, and the company’s cloud computing business. Reuters on Monday had reported that the layoff total could actually affect as many as 30,000, but Amazon says that will increase hiring for some parts of the business and the 14,000 figure represents an overall workforce reduction. The newly planned cuts would surpass the total of the company’s rolling reductions in 2022 and 2023 that led to more than 27,000 corporate job eliminations, as Amazon and other tech giants angled to slim their workforce after a pandemic-era boom in hiring. Global IT spending is projected to hit a record in 2026. As CIOs are busy preparing their 2026 budgets, it looks like many of these technologies will have a lot more money to invest in generative AI and other technologies, as research firm Gartner projects that global IT spending will surpass $6 trillion. It would be a record amount and indicates a big 9.8% increase in spending from this year, growth that is driven by investments in data center systems and software, both categories that reflect the increased demand for AI. “The cost of software is going up and both the cost of features and functionality is going up as well thanks to gen AI,” said John-David Lovelock, an analyst for Gartner. Gartner also projects that shipments for mobile phones and PCs would be strong next year, but at a slower pace than in 2025. Alaska Airlines to review IT systems after recent outages. After an IT outage grounded hundreds of flights late last week and caused four days of flight disruptions this summer due to a hardware failure, the airline says it will bring in external experts to review its IT infrastructure. “We are immediately bringing in outside technical experts to diagnose our entire IT infrastructure to ensure we are as resilient as we need to be,” the company said in a statement shared with the Anchorage Daily News. An airline analyst at Raymond James has warned that the IT outage that canceled about 400 flights could cost Alaska Airlines $26 million. Those losses will be included in the company’s fourth-quarter results. McKinsey warns bank profits could take a massive hit if they don’t adapt to AI. The consulting giant has issued a stark report that warns that AI could erode the banking industry’s profitability by $170 billion, or 9%, over the course of the next decade, as consumers will embrace AI agents instead of humans to handle some of their financial services needs. Bloomberg notes that while the banking sector is set to generate cost savings between 15% to 20% from investments in AI, McKinsey has warned that competition from AI will likely erode those gains and that most of the benefits will be accrued by customers. Leaders are bullish on the ROI for agentic AI despite tech being in early stages of deployment. While some recent studies have poured cold water on the promised ROI of AI, an agentic AI-focused survey published Wednesday from data intelligence company Collibra and The Harris Poll took a far more bullish stance. 86% of respondents say they were “confident” that agentic AI will drive ROI for their total organization, with similar proportions confident that their investments in the technology will spur innovation (85%) and governance (84%). The survey polled more than 300 data management, privacy, and AI decision makers from U.S.-based companies. Nine out of ten technology leaders say their organization is currently developing or rolling out agentic AI, though most remain in the very early stages of developing this more autonomous form of the technology. When asked about implementation methods, a clear majority are relying on vendors or third-party partnerships (58%), while 49% are building their own agentic systems internally. Collibra CEO and founder Felix Van de Maele tells Fortune that many enterprises will build their AI agents on top of platforms offered by Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, and others, but that this approach will come with challenges related to tracking an explosion in the number of agents that will be deployed, data reliability, and securely monitoring what actions they are authorized to take. “If something goes wrong, the impact is much bigger,” says Van de Maele. “The stakes are higher and so the governance of that is going to be important.” Courtesy of Collibra Hiring: - USPTO is seeking a CIO, based in Alexandria, Virginia.

Title: One chart shows how Amazon's layoffs are a drop in the bucket after its pandemic-era hiring spree

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is laying off thousands of employees, but there are still plenty of people working there. The 14,000 corporate workers being let go are about 0.9% of its roughly 1.6 million employees as of the end of last year. The Big Tech company expanded to over a million full-time and part-time employees in 2020, climbing to 1.6 million a year later when there was a lot of turnover in the overall US workforce as the economy reopened after the pandemic-induced recession. Amazon's workforce has roughly tripled between 2017 and 2024. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a message to workers on Tuesday that the new cuts "are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs." Amazon is just one large company that's laying off workers. UPS said in its third-quarter earnings that it has cut thousands of roles in the first nine months of the year. Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, told Business Insider that AI is a plausible factor in the current spate of layoffs. However, he added that the elevated hiring a few years ago is likely the larger reason. "I see this as mainly a correction to pandemic-era dynamics rather than some new thing like AI that's striking these companies," Tedeschi said. During the Great Resignation and the hot labor market following the big post-COVID reopening, workers felt empowered to move around a lot. That also meant companies opening up roles and seeking new hires. Tedeschi said companies were able to maintain their beefed-up workforce for a while, but can't continue to do so in a more uncertain period. "The other shoe is dropping, and they have to cost optimize and let some of those people go," Tedeschi said. Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, told Business Insider that the US is in a low-hire, low-fire job market, following a high-hire market with high quits just a few years ago. "We've just had some pretty dramatic changes in the labor market in recent years," Sahm said. Some of the laid-off Amazon workers could end up finding a new role at the company. Galetti said in the Tuesday message that the company is "offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Jump to

About us Copy link Wall Street is embracing crypto like never before. But financial institutions may struggle to know where to begin. The Ethereum Foundation is aiming to make this easier for them with the launch of a new website. On Wednesday, the organisation, which helps develop and maintain the Ethereum blockchain, launched the new online resource to help guide firms looking to integrate the blockchain into their businesses. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” a post from the foundation said, adding that the site will help guide businesses adopting Ethereum and showcase how the ecosystem is building a new financial system. 1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we’re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0 1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we’re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0 The site highlights institutional use cases for Ethereum, including stablecoins, the tokenisation of real-world assets like bonds, and decentralised financial applications. It also contains statistics on the blockchain’s use, and information on firms like BlackRock, Visa, and eToro, who are already experimenting with Ethereum. Ethereum is the biggest blockchain for DeFi, with some $118 billion worth of deposits to more than one thousand protocols. It also hosts more than half of the $308 billion stablecoin market. But the blockchain’s stewards — namely the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation — have previously faced criticism for not doing enough to support institutional adoption on the blockchain compared to its rivals. The move comes amid a crypto land grab among the paragons of traditional finance who are looking to leverage blockchain technology following landmark legislation being approved this summer. On Tuesday, banking giant Citi announced a partnership with US crypto exchange Coinbase to foster the adoption of stablecoins. The firms plan to build stablecoin on- and off-ramps, streamline settlement, and make digital dollars flow 24/7. Over the past week, Zelle and Western Union have also revealed plans to integrate stablecoins into their operations. Seeing the growing institutional interest, the Ethereum Foundation has sought to make the blockchain more attractive for financial firms looking to integrate the technology. Last year, the foundation, along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, funded research into Wall Street’s interest in Ethereum through Etherealize, a startup focused on integrating traditional finance with the blockchain. “Institutions need someone to be the face of the organisation that is representing Ethereum,” Tomasz Stańczak, one of the Ethereum Foundation’s co-directors, told DL News in July. Etherealize has bold plans for adoption. In September, CEO Vivek Raman told DL News of his ambition to onboard the $16 trillion mortgage market to Ethereum. “The whole fixed income space of really esoteric objects, such as mortgages, is a huge design space to tokenise those natively,” Raman said. In addition to courting institutions, representatives from Etherealize met with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force in May to discuss how the regulator could accommodate tokenisation of stocks and bonds on the blockchain.

Title: Investment Bank Mizuho Says Visa Is Becoming the ‘Stablecoin of Stablecoins’
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/29/investment-bank-mizuho-says-visa-is-becoming-the-stablecoin-of-stablecoins

Japanese investment bank Mizuho called Visa (V) the “stablecoin of stablecoins,” arguing that the payments giant has become a core part of the global stablecoin infrastructure. Visa’s expanding network of stablecoin-linked card programs, now over 130 in more than 40 countries, with spending up fourfold year-on-year, gives it a central role in blockchain-based payments, according to the Wednesday report. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. Tether's USDT is the largest stablecoin, followed by Circle Internet's (CRCL) USDC. The bank has an outperform rating on Visa shares with a $425 price target. The stock was 1% lower, around $343.30, at publication time. Visa could emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of stablecoin adoption, helped by momentum from the GENIUS Act and its long-running Visa Direct initiative, analysts Dan Dolev and Alexander Jenkins wrote. Visa Direct has grown about 50% annually since 2016 and now accounts for roughly 15%–20% of global debit volume, or over $1.1 trillion, they said. With a growing array of stablecoins, from USDT and USDC to PayPal’s PYUSD and various central bank projects, the analysts said a centralized hub like Visa offers a powerful competitive advantage. The analysts also pointed to Visa’s move to let banks mint and burn their own stablecoins using its tokenized asset platform, suggesting that individual stablecoins such as USDC are becoming interchangeable, and that networks like Visa or Mastercard (MA) will ultimately capture the most value. Visa currently supports four stablecoins on its platform, USDG, PYUSD, EURC and USDC. Mizuho said this is only the beginning. As stablecoins become more commoditized, the bank sees Visa’s role as the “network of networks” or “stablecoin of stablecoins” as a key long-term growth driver. The bank's analysts reiterated its view that Circle (CRCL), the issuer of USDC, is overvalued, maintaining an underperform rating and an $84 price target. Circle shares fell 3.45%, trading around $131.37 at publication time.

Globalisation has always had its critics – but until recently, they have come mainly from the left rather than the right. In the wake of the second world war, as the world economy grew rapidly under US dominance, many on the left argued that the gains of globalisation were unequally distributed, increasing inequality in rich countries while forcing poorer countries to implement free-market policies such as opening up their financial markets, privatising their state industries and rejecting expansionary fiscal policies in favour of debt repayment – all of which mainly benefited US corporations and banks. This was not a new concern. Back in 1841, German economist Friedrich List had argued that free trade was designed to keep Britain’s global dominance from being challenged, suggesting: When anyone has obtained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he climbs up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. By the 1990s, critics of the US vision of a global world order such as the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that globalisation in its current form benefited the US at the expense of developing countries and workers – while author and activist Naomi Klein focused on the negative environmental and cultural consequences of the global expansion of multinational companies. Mass left-led demonstrations broke out, disrupting global economic meetings including, most famously, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999. During this “battle of Seattle”, violent exchanges between protesters and police prevented the launch of a new world trade round that had been backed by then US president, Bill Clinton. For a while, the mass mobilisation of a coalition of trade unionists, environmentalists and anti-capitalist protesters seemed set to challenge the path towards further globalisation – with anti-capitalism “Occupy” protests spreading around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. In the US, a further critique of globalisation centred on its domestic consequences for American workers – namely, job losses and lower pay – and led to calls for greater protectionism. Although initially led by trade unions and some Democratic politicians, this critique gradually gained purchase in radical right circles who opposed giving any role to international organisations like the WTO, on the grounds that they impinged on American sovereignty. According to this view, only by stopping foreign competition whose low wages undercut American workers could prosperity be restored. Immigration was another target. Under Donald Trump’s second term as US president, these criticisms have been transformed into radical, deeply disruptive economic and social policies – with tariffs and protectionism at their heart. In so doing, Trump – despite all his grandstanding on the world stage – has confirmed what has long been clear to close observers of US politics and business: that the American century of global dominance, with the dollar as unrivalled no.1 currency, is drawing rapidly to a close. Even before Trump first took office in 2017, the US had begun to withdraw from its leadership role in international economic institutions such as the WTO. Now, the strongest part of its economy, the hi-tech sector, is under intense pressure from China, whose economy is already bigger than the US’s by one key measure of GDP. Meanwhile, the majority of US citizens are facing stagnant incomes, higher prices and more insecure jobs. In previous centuries, when first France and then Great Britain reached the end of their eras of world domination, these transitions had painful impacts beyond their borders. This time, with the global economy more closely integrated than ever before and no single dominant power waiting in the wings to take over, the impacts could be felt even more widely – with very damaging, if not catastrophic, results. When it comes to taking over from the US as the world’s leading hegemonic power, the only viable candidates with big enough economies are the European Union and China. But there are strong reasons to doubt that either could take on this role – notwithstanding the fact that in 2022, then US president Joe Biden’s National Security Strategy called China: “The only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so.” At times Biden’s successor, President Trump, has sounded almost jealous of the control China’s leaders exert over their national economy, and the fact they do not face elections and limits on their terms in office. But a one-party, authoritarian political system which lacks legal checks and balances is a key reason China will find it hard to gain the cultural and political dominance among democratic nations that is part of achieving world no.1 status – despite the influence it already wields in large parts of Asia and Africa. China still faces big economic challenges too. While it is already the global leader in manufactured goods (rapidly moving into hi-tech products) and the world’s largest exporter, its economy is still very unbalanced – with a much smaller consumer sector, a weak property market, many inefficient state industries that are highly indebted, and a relatively small financial sector restricted by state ownership. Nor does China possess a global currency, despite its (limited) attempts to make the renminbi a truly international currency. The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges. As I found on a reporting trip to Shanghai in 2007 to investigate the effects of globalisation, there are also enormous differences between China’s prosperous coastal megacities – whose main thoroughfares rival New York and Paris – and the relative poverty in the interior, especially in rural areas. But nearly two decades on from that visit, with the country’s growth rate slowing, many university-educated young people are also finding it hard to find well-paid jobs now. Meanwhile Europe – the only other contender to take the US’s place as global no.1 – is deeply politically divided, with smaller, weaker economies to the east and south far more sceptical about the benefits of globalisation, and increasingly divided on issues such as migration and the Ukraine war. The challenges of achieving broad policy agreement among all member states, and the problem of who can speak for Europe, make it unlikely that the EU as currently constituted could initiate and enforce a new global world order on its own. The EU’s financial system also lacks the heft of the US’s. Although it has a common currency (the euro) managed by the European Central Bank, its financial system is far more fragmented. Banks are regulated nationally, and each country issues its own government bonds (although a few eurobonds now exist). This makes it hard for the euro to replace the dollar as a store of value, and reduces the incentive for foreigners to hold euros as an alternative reserve currency. Meanwhile, any future prospects of a renewal of US global leadership look similarly unpromising. Trump’s policy of cutting taxes while increasing the size of the US government debt – which now stands at US$38 trillion, or 120% of GDP – threatens both the stability of the world economy and the ability of the US to finance this mind-boggling deficit. Tellingly, the Trump administration shows no interest in reviving, or even engaging with, many of the international financial institutions which America once dominated, and which helped shape the world economic order – as US trade representative Jamieson Greer expressed disdainfully in the New York Times recently: Our current, nameless global order, which is dominated by the WTO and is notionally designed to pursue economic efficiency and regulate the trade policies of its 166 member countries, is untenable and unsustainable. The US has paid for this system with the loss of industrial jobs and economic security, and the biggest winner has been China. While the US is not, so far, withdrawing from the IMF, the Trump administration has urged it to call out China for running such a large trade surplus, while abandoning its concern about climate change. Greer concluded that the US has “subordinated our country’s economic and national security imperatives to a lowest common denominator of global consensus”. To understand the potential dangers ahead, we must go back more than a century to the last time there was no global hegemon. By the time the first world war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28 1919, the international economic order had collapsed. Britain, world leader over the previous century, no longer possessed the economic, political or military clout to enforce its version of globalisation. The UK government, burdened by the huge debts it had taken out to finance the war effort, was forced to make major cuts in public spending. In 1931, it faced a sterling crisis: the pound had to be devalued as the UK exited from the gold standard for good, despite having yielded to the demands of international bankers to cut payments to the unemployed. This was a final sign that Britain had lost its dominant place in the world economic order. The 1930s were a time of deep political unease and unrest in Britain and many other countries. In 1936, unemployed workers from Jarrow, a town in north-east England with 70% unemployment after its shipyards closed, organised a non-political “hunger march” to London which became known as the Jarrow crusade. More than 200 men, dressed in their Sunday best, marched peacefully in step for over 200 miles, gaining great support along the way. Yet when they reached London, prime minister Stanley Baldwin ignored their petition – and the men were informed their dole money would be docked because they had been unavailable for work over the past fortnight. Europe was also facing a severe economic crisis. After Germany’s government refused to pay the reparations agreed in the 1919 Versailles treaty, saying they would bankrupt its economy, the French army occupied the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr and German workers went on strike, supported by their government. The ensuing struggle fuelled hyperinflation in Germany. By November 1923, it took 200,000 million marks to buy a loaf of bread, and the savings and pensions of the German middle class were wiped out. That month, Adolf Hitler made his first attempt to seize power in the failed “Beer hall putsch” in Munich. In contrast, across the Atlantic, the US was enjoying a period of postwar prosperity, with a booming stock market and explosive growth of new industries such as car manufacturing. But despite emerging as the world’s strongest economic power, having financed much of the Allied war effort, it was unwilling to grasp the reins of global economic leadership. The Republican US Congress, having blocked President Woodrow Wilson’s plan for a League of Nations, instead embraced isolationism and washed its hands of Europe’s problems. The US refused to cancel or even reduce the war debts owed it by the Allied nations, who eventually repudiated their debts. In retaliation, the US Congress banned all American banks from lending money to these so-called allies. Then, in 1929, the affluent American “jazz age” came to an abrupt halt with a stock market crash that wiped off half its value. The country’s largest manufacturer, Ford, closed its doors for a year and laid off all its workers. With a quarter of the nation unemployed, long lines for soup kitchens were seen in every city, while those who had been evicted camped out wherever they could – including in New York’s Central Park, renamed “Hooverville” after the hapless US president of that time, Herbert Hoover. In rural areas where the collapse in agricultural prices meant farmers could no longer make a living, armed farmers stopped food and milk trucks and destroyed their contents in a vain attempt to limit supply and raise prices. By March 1933, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the entire US banking system had ground to a standstill, with no one able to withdraw money from their bank account. With its focus on this devastating Great Depression, the US refused to get involved in attempts at international economic cooperation. With no notice, Roosevelt withdrew from the 1933 London Conference which had been called to stabilise the world’s currencies – sending a message denouncing “the old fetishes of the so-called international bankers”. With the US following the UK off the gold standard, the resulting currency wars exacerbated the crisis and further weakened European economies. As countries reverted to mercantilist policies of protectionism and trade wars, world trade shrank dramatically. The situation became even worse in central Europe, where the collapse of the huge Credit-Anstalt bank in Austria in 1931 reverberated around the region. In Germany, as mass unemployment soared, centrist parties were squeezed and armed riots broke out between communist and fascist supporters. When the Nazis came to power, they introduced a policy of autarky, cutting economic ties with the west to build up their military machine. The economic rivalries and antagonisms which weakened western economies paved the way for the rise of fascism in Germany. In some sense, Hitler – an admirer of the British empire – aspired to be the next hegemonic economic as well as military power, creating his own empire by conquering and ruthlessly exploiting the resources of the rest of Europe. Nearly a century later, there are some disturbing parallels with that interwar period. Like America after the first world war, Trump insists that countries the US has supported militarily now owe it money for this protection. He wants to encourage currency wars by devaluing the dollar, and raise protectionist barriers to protect domestic industry. The 1920s was also a time when the US sharply limited immigration on eugenic grounds, only allowing it from northern European countries which (the eugenicists argued) would not “pollute the white race”. Clearly, Trump does not view the lack of international cooperation that could amplify the damaging economic effects of a stock or bond market crash as a problem that should concern him. And in today’s unstable world, for all the US’s past failings as a global leader, that is a very worrying proposition. Once again, the rules of the international order are breaking down. While it is possible that Trump’s approach will not be fully adopted by his successor in the White House, the direction of travel in the US will almost certainly remain sceptical about the benefits of globalisation, with limited support for any worldwide economic rules or initiatives. We see similar scepticism about the benefits of globalisation emerging in other countries, amid the rise of rightwing populist parties in much of Europe and South America – many backed by Trump. Fuelling these parties’ support are growing concerns about income inequality, slow growth and immigration which are not being addressed by the current political system – and all of which would be exacerbated by the onset of a new global economic crisis. With the global economy and financial system far bigger than ever before, a new crisis could be even more severe than the one that occurred in 2008, when the failure of the banking system left the world teetering on the brink of collapse. The scale of this crisis was unprecedented, but key US and UK government officials moved boldly and swiftly. As a BBC reporter in Washington, I attended the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee hearing three days after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, paralysing the global financial system, to find out the administration’s response. I remember the stunned look on the face of the committee’s chairman, Barney Frank, when he asked US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson and US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke how much money they might need to stabilise the situation: “Let’s start with US$1 trillion,” Bernanke replied coolly. “But we have another US$2 trillion on our balance sheet if we need it.” Shortly afterwards, the US Congress approved a US$700 billion rescue package. While the global economy has still not fully recovered from this crisis, it could have been far worse – possibly as bad as the 1930s – without such intervention. Around the world, governments ended up pledging US$11 trillion to guarantee the solvency of their banking systems, with the UK government putting up a sum equivalent to the country’s entire yearly GDP. But it was not just governments. At the G20 summit in London in April 2009, a new US$1.1 trillion fund was set up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to advance money to countries that were getting into financial difficulty. The G20 also agreed to impose tougher regulatory standards for banks and other financial institutions that would apply globally, to replace the weak regulation of banks that had been one of the main causes of the crisis. As a reporter at this summit, I recall widespread excitement and optimism that the world was finally working together to tackle its global problems, with the host prime minister, Gordon Brown, briefly glowing in the limelight as organiser of that summit. Behind the scenes, the US Federal Reserve had also been working to contain the crisis by quietly passing on to the world’s other leading central banks nearly US$600 billion in “currency swaps” to ensure they had the dollars they needed to bail out their own banking systems. The Bank of England secretly lent UK banks £100 billion to ensure they didn’t collapse, although two of the four major banks, Royal Bank of Scotland (now NatWest) and Lloyds, ultimately had to be nationalised (to different extents) to keep the financial system stable. However, these rescue packages for banks, while much needed to stabilise the global economy, did not extend to many of the victims of the crash – such as the 12 million US households whose homes were now worth less than the mortgage they had taken out to pay for them, or the 40% of households who experienced financial distress during the 18 months after the crash. And the ramifications of the crisis were even greater for those living in developing countries. A few months after the 2008 financial crisis began, I travelled to Zambia, an African country totally dependent on copper exports for its foreign exchange. I visited the Luanshya copper mine near Ndola in the country’s copper belt. With demand for copper (used mainly in construction and car manufacturing) collapsing, all the copper mines had closed. Their workers, in one of the few well-paid jobs in Zambia, were forced to leave their comfortable company homes and return to sharing with their relatives in Lusaka without pay. Zambia’s government was forced to shut down its planned poverty reduction plan, which was to be funded by mining profits. The collapse in exports also damaged the Zambian currency, which dropped sharply. This hit the country’s poorest people hard as it raised the price of food, most of which was imported. I also visited a flower farm near Lusaka, where Dutch expats Angelique and Watze Elsinga had been growing roses for export for over a decade – employing more than 200 workers who were given housing and education. As the market for Valentine’s Day roses collapsed, their bankers, Barclays South Africa, suddenly ordered them to immediately repay all their loans, forcing them to sell their farm and dismiss their workers. Ultimately, it took a US$3.9 billion loan from the IMF and World Bank to stabilise Zambia’s economy. Should another global financial crisis hit, it is hard to see the Trump administration (and others that follow) being as sympathetic to the plight of developing countries, or allowing the Federal Reserve to lend major sums to foreign central banks – unless it is a country politically aligned with Trump, such as Argentina. Least likely of all is the idea of Trump working with other countries to develop a global trillion-dollar rescue package to help save the world economy. Rather, there is a real worry that reckless actions by the Trump administration – and weak global regulation of financial markets – could trigger the next global financial crisis. Economic historians agree that financial crises are endemic in the history of global capitalism, and they have been increasing in frequency since the “hyper-globalisation” of the 1970s. From Latin America’s debt crisis in the 1980s to the Asia currency crisis in the late 1990s and the US dotcom stock market collapse in the early 2000s, crises have regularly devastated economies and regions around the world. Today, the greatest risk is the collapse of the US Treasury bond market, which underpins the global financial system and is involved in 70% of global financial transactions by banks and other financial institutions. Around the world, these institutions have long regarded the US bond market, worth over $30 trillion, as a safe haven, because these “debt securities” are backed by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Increasingly, the unregulated “shadow banking system” – a sector now larger than regulated global banks – is deeply involved in the bond market. Non-bank financial institutions such as private equity, hedge funds, venture capital and pension funds are largely unregulated and, unlike banks, are not required to hold reserves. Bond market jitters are already unnerving global financial markets, which fear its unravelling could precipitate a banking crisis on the scale of 2008 – with highly leveraged transactions by these non-bank financial institutions leaving them exposed. Buyers of US bonds are also troubled by the Trump administration’s plan to raise the US deficit even higher to pay for tax cuts – with the national debt now forecast to rise to 134% of US GDP by 2035, up from 120% in 2025. Should this lead to a widespread refusal to buy more US bonds among jittery investors, their value would collapse and interest rates – both in the US and globally – would soar. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, recently warned that the situation has “worrying echoes of the 2008 financial crisis”, while the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, said her worries about the collapse of private credit markets sometimes keep her awake at night. A bad situation would grow even worse if problems in the bond market precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar. The world’s “anchor currency” would no longer be seen as a safe store of value – leading to more withdrawals of funds from the US Treasury bond market, where many foreign governments hold their reserves. A weaker dollar would also make imported goods more expensive for US consumers, while potentially boosting the country’s exports. This is precisely the course of action advocated by Stephen Miran, chair of the US president’s Council of Economic Advisors – who Trump appears to want to be the next head of the Federal Reserve. One example of what could happen if bond markets become destabilised occurred when the shortest-lived prime minister in UK history, Liz Truss, announced huge unfunded tax cuts in her 2022 budget, causing the value of UK gilts (the equivalent of US Treasury bonds) to plummet as interest rates spiked. Within days, the Bank of England was forced to put up an emergency £60 billion rescue fund to avoid major UK pension funds collapsing. In the case of a US bond market crash, however, there are growing fears that the US government would be unable – and unwilling – to step in to mitigate such damage. Just as worrying would be a crash of the US stock market – which, by historic standards, is currently vastly overvalued. Huge recent increases in the US stock market’s overall value have been driven almost entirely by the “magnificent seven” hi-tech companies, which alone make up a third of its total value. If their big bet on artificial intelligence is not as lucrative as they claim, or is overshadowed by the success of China’s AI systems, a sharp downturn, similar to the dotcom crash of 2000-02, could well occur. Read more: What 2,000 years of Chinese history reveals about today's AI-driven technology panic – and the future of inequality Jamie Dimon, head of the US’s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, has said he is “far more worried than other [experts]” about a serious market correction, which he warned could come in the next six months to two years. Big tech executives have been overoptimistic before. Reporting from Silicon Valley in 2001 as the dotcom bubble was bursting, I was struck by the unshakeable belief of internet startup CEOs that their share prices could only go up. Furthermore, their companies’ high stock valuations had allowed them to take over their competitors, thus limiting competition – just as companies such as Google and Meta (Facebook) have since used their highly valued shares to purchase key assets and potential rivals including YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and DeepMind. History suggests this is always bad for the economy in the long run. With the business and financial worlds now ever more closely linked, not only has the frequency of financial crises increased in the last half-century, each crisis has become more interconnected. The 2008 global financial crisis showed how dangerous this can be: a global banking crisis triggered stock market falls, collapses in the value of weak currencies, a debt crisis in developing countries – and ultimately, a global recession that has taken years to recover from. The IMF’s latest financial stability report summarised the situation in worrying terms, highlighting “elevated” stability risks as a result of “stretched asset valuations, growing pressure in sovereign bond markets, and the increasing role of non-bank financial institutions. Despite its deep liquidity, the global foreign exchange market remains vulnerable to macrofinancial uncertainty.” I believe we may be entering a new era of sustained financial chaos during which the seeds sown by the death of globalisation – and Trump’s response to it – finally shatter the world economic and political order established after the second world war. Trump’s high and erratically applied tariffs – aimed most strongly at China – have already made it difficult to reconfigure global supply chains. Even more worrying could be the struggle over the control of key strategic raw materials like the rare earth minerals needed for hi-tech industries, with China banning their export and the US threatening 100% tariffs in return (as well as hoping to take over Greenland, with its as-yet-untapped supply of some of these minerals). This conflict over rare earths, vital for the computer chips needed for AI, could also threaten the market value of high-flying tech stocks such as Nvidia, the first company to exceed US$4 trillion in value. The battle for control of critical raw materials could escalate. There is a danger that in some cases, trade wars might become real wars – just as they did in the former era of mercantilism. Many recent and current regional conflicts, from the first Iraq war aimed at the conquest of the oilfields of Kuwait, to the civil war in Sudan over control of the country’s goldmines, are rooted in economic conflicts. The history of globalisation over the past four centuries suggests that the presence of a global superpower – for all its negative sides – has brought a degree of economic stability in an uncertain world. In contrast, a key lesson of history is that a return to policies of mercantilism – with countries struggling to seize key natural resources for themselves and deny them to their rivals – is most likely a recipe for perpetual conflict. But this time around, in a world full of 10,000 nuclear weapons, miscalculations could be fatal if trust and certainty are undermined. The challenges ahead are immense – and the weakness of international institutions, the limited visions of most governments and the alienation of many of their citizens are not optimistic signs.

Title: Wall Street zeroes in on AWS and AI investments ahead of Amazon's Q3 earnings report

Amazon's stock popped more than 13% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported huge growth in the third quarter, including in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. CEO Andy Jassy said AWS was "growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022." He also called out particularly strong demand for its AI offerings. "We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure," Jassy said. The company's results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, offering investors a sigh of relief, particularly as Amazon's stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven this year. "This banner quarter could mark a turning point for investor sentiment and set the stage for Amazon to reclaim a leadership role among large-cap tech stocks heading into year-end," Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said on Thursday afternoon. The earnings report came after Amazon earlier this week said it would be cutting 14,000 jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in its history. Jassy told analysts on Thursday's earnings call that the layoffs were "not financially driven" and were instead about making the company faster after years of head count growth. Amazon's stock is up 13% in after-hours trading as the company's earnings call ends. AI agents could become a big part of how people shop online, but there's still room for improvement, Jassy said. Many shopping agents don't have access to shoppers' purchase history, limiting how good their suggestions are. They also often mess up basic information, such as an item's price, he said. AI agents could become a big part of how people shop online, but there's still room for improvement, Jassy said. Many shopping agents don't have access to shoppers' purchase history, limiting how good their suggestions are. They also often mess up basic information, such as an item's price, he said. That will likely change, though. "I do think that we will find ways to partner" with AI shopping tools, he said. Jassy said that Tuesday's layoffs were "not financially driven." Instead, he said, it's about culture. Amazon grew its head count over the past few years, which "can weaken the ownership" of Amazon employees who "are doing the actual work" and slow down key decisions, Jassy said. He added that Amazon wants a flat, fast organization. Jassy said Whole Foods is growing faster than most grocery chains. He also told analysts to expect more locations for Whole Foods Daily Shop, the chain's latest small-format grocery. Amazon is "most excited about" the ability to deliver perishable groceries for same-day delivery. Jassy added that the ability to order fresh foods multiple times a week for delivery, like Amazon provides, is part of the reason more customers are avoiding a weekly stock-up. Jassy said that Amazon will always offer customers multiple chip options, including those from rivals like Nvidia. At the same time, he said, Amazon's in-house chips make it different from other tech players. Amazon's Trainium chips, including its Trainium 3, will offer customers better value, especially as they try to use AI more broadly, he said. The first question asked how capacity-constrained AWS is right now. Jassy said that Amazon increased capacity during the quarter. The company plans to double its capacity by the end of 2027. The first question asked how capacity-constrained AWS is right now. Jassy said that Amazon increased capacity during the quarter. The company plans to double its capacity by the end of 2027. There's also lots of interest from customers in Amazon's Trainium chip, Jassy said. Amazon expects capital expenditures of about $125 billion for 2025, CFO Olsavsky said. That's above the $118.76 billion that analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting. That will increase in 2026, he adds.

That will increase in 2026, he adds. For the third quarter, Amazon's capex was $34.2 billion. Jassy highlighted the fourth quarter as a key one for Amazon, with the holiday shopping season and AWS's re:Invent conference scheduled for December, before handing the call over to CFO Brian Olsavsky. Jassy said that Amazon sees opportunities to grow advertising around Prime Video, adding that live sports have gotten a lot of interest from advertisers. For the third quarter, advertising services net sales rose 24% to $17.7 billion. Jassy said Rufus had 250 million active users this year, and that customers using Rufus during a shopping trip were 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Amazon is on track to beat its delivery speed record again this year for Prime members, Jassy said. Jassy said a new option that lets customers add items to orders they've already scheduled has been used 80 million times. Jassy highlighted how some Amazon agentic coding tools have saved time and money for its clients. Kiro, for example, attracted about 100,000 developers in an initial preview, and the number of users is now more than double that. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy kicked off the call by talking about AWS, teasing unannounced deals worth more than all new deals in its third quarter. He also briefly mentioned that Amazon's competitors have smaller annual revenue than AWS does. CEO Andy Jassy, CFO Brian Olsavsky, and head of investor relations Dave Fildes are kicking it off with prepared remarks. Shares of Amazon are 11% higher in after-hours trading as the company's earnings call is about to begin. Amazon grew the number of rural communities that had access to same-day and next-day delivery by 60% over the past four months, it said in its earnings release. The e-commerce giant is increasingly competing with Walmart and Dollar General as it offers faster delivery in small towns and other sparsely populated parts of the US. Amazon's earnings show that the company is "firing on all cylinders after a year of relative underperformance," Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said on Thursday afternoon. The results are also a good sign for Amazon's standing in relation to the other Big Tech stocks, Feller said.

The results are also a good sign for Amazon's standing in relation to the other Big Tech stocks, Feller said. "Despite lagging the Magnificent Seven and the broader market for much of 2025, the company's fundamentals never meaningfully weakened," Feller wrote. "This banner quarter could mark a turning point for investor sentiment and set the stage for Amazon to reclaim a leadership role among large-cap tech stocks heading into year-end." Amazon's third-quarter results show the company is making progress in adding AI to its operations, Investing.com's senior analyst Jesse Cohen said. "Although AWS sales fell slightly short of projections, the division still achieved its fastest growth pace since 2022, underscoring the robust demand for cloud services," Cohen wrote.

Amazon shares were up more than 9% after the company reported its earnings Thursday afternoon. One factor could be CEO Andy Jassy's comments on AWS.

"AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY," Jassy said in Amazon's earnings release. "We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months." Amazon's third quarter included two big one-time charges. The first is $1.8 billion in estimated severance costs "primarily related to planned role eliminations." The other was its previously announced $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over its Prime membership program. Third quarter results: Fourth quarter guidance: Third quarter results: Fourth quarter guidance: Source: Bloomberg and company filings Amazon's Prime Day event in October has become an early chance for shoppers to score holiday deals, and other retailers have even debuted their own versions. On Thursday's call, Amazon could provide an early glimpse into how holiday shopping is shaping up. Expect Amazon to play a big role once the holiday shopping season starts in earnest. About 73% of shoppers surveyed by marketing platform Omnisend said that Amazon is their go-to source for deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon's ad business has been finding potential growth opportunities lately. A recent deal with Netflix will let brands buy ad slots on the streamer through Amazon's own demand-side platform. The move rattled shares of adtech rival The Trade Desk after it was announced. Amazon is expected to give a capital expenditures update on its earnings call this afternoon. Last quarter, Amazon's capex totaled $31.4 billion, and the company said the figure was "reasonably representative" of its quarterly capex rate for the rest of the year. It's largely driven by investments in AWS — particularly AI and tech infrastructure — and Amazon's fulfillment and transportation network. Capex growth is a hot-button issue across Big Tech. The following chart shows how spending stacks up so far. Investors will be listening for any details that CEO Andy Jassy and the company offer about Amazon's grocery business in light of a recent reboot. In June, a memo obtained by Business Insider showed that Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go were being united under a single "One Grocery" operation eight years after Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.

The company launched a $5 private-label grocery line earlier this month aimed at luring value hunters away from Walmart and Aldi. Wedbush has high hopes for the tech giant heading into the call, maintaining a $280 price target, up from its previous target of $250 a share. The firm's analysts predict that it is poised for a breakout in 2026 and likely to shake off the volatility that has weighed on the stock recently. They expect Amazon to reach $99.6 billion in full-year revenue, and predict Q3 revenue of $20.1 billion.

They expect Amazon to reach $99.6 billion in full-year revenue, and predict Q3 revenue of $20.1 billion. "Heading into the print, we are most focused on AWS momentum and emerging AI monetization, rising operating margins supported by the mix shift to higher-margin revenue, capex requirements to support infrastructure and AI investments, and persistent growth within the advertising business," Wedbush analysts wrote in a preview note. They also cited several immediate-term catalysts, including savings from automation and robotics progress, and the commercialization of Alexa's new AI capabilities. Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito will join Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to talk about Amazon's decision this week to lay off 14,000 employees in a livestream at 2 p.m. ET. AI's role in the layoffs will be a key topic. Got a question that you want the panel to answer? Send it to moderator Dan DeFrancesco. Amazon said on Tuesday that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. It raised a big question for Wall Street: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient? Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in Thursday's Tech Memo newsletter that Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer that all-important question.

Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in Thursday's Tech Memo newsletter that Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer that all-important question. Revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's crucial cloud business, is the number to watch when Amazon reports this afternoon, Barr wrote. For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to increase 18% year over year to $32.4 billion, according to Bloomberg. UBS analysts are feeling optimistic heading into the report, although they anticipate some "noise" around operating income due to the company's recent $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC. The bank recently raised its price target for Amazon stock from $271 to $279, maintaining its Buy rating. While analysts said that they are waiting to see investment proof points from AWS, they still see the area as a likely growth driver for Amazon, as they expect multiple headwinds to wane in the near future.

"Overall, we continue to see the potential for upside across Amazon's business segments, including e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and Kuiper / low earth orbit satellites," analysts wrote in a recent earnings preview. Investors will want to hear more about AWS's latest AI strategy, including what it's doing to attract new customers. Early-stage startups are skipping traditional cloud spending and heading straight to model-training tools and niche providers. These companies are Amazon's "blind spot," according to an internal document seen by Business Insider. Amazon has traditionally relied on venture capital firms to find startups that could be new clients.

Amazon has traditionally relied on venture capital firms to find startups that could be new clients. AWS also hired a new vice president of security services and observability this month, a sign that the unit is trying to improve security around its AI products. JPMorgan analysts said that while they believe Amazon has done a good job executing on retail sales and margin expansion, they're worried about its positioning in the booming generative AI space. "There is concern around AMZN's GenAI positioning/strategy, relative gap to Azure/Google Cloud growth, & trajectory of 2H AWS growth pick-up," they said. "There is also concern around the impact of tariffs & changes to the de minimis exemption on demand & OI margins."

However, the analysts add that AWS growth acceleration will likely continue, and said that they expect AI supply chain gaps to ease, which they see as bullish for Amazon. JPMorgan maintains an overweight rating and a $265 price target for Amazon stock. Amazon ranks last among the Magnificent Seven tech companies — and the broader S&P 500 — when it comes to stock performance over the last five years, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli wrote in Thursday's First Trade newsletter. Amazon's stock has returned 43% over that period, behind Meta's 168%, Alphabet's 253%, and Nvidia's mammoth 1,490%.

On Wall Street, some interpret Amazon's position on that chart as a sign that its AI strategy is struggling to compete with rivals. BofA analysts are upbeat heading into the report, even as doubts swirl around Amazon's AI strategy. "Given healthy retail sales, strength in Online advertising, and July AWS layoffs, we see potential for operating income upside and are 4% above Street for GAAP operating profit at $20.4bn vs $19.7bn," the analysts wrote.

A man whose son was beaten to death before his body was dumped in a woodland has said the murderers did not show “one bit of remorse for what they did” despite listening to “horror stories” in court during their trial. The family of Kieran Quilligan (47) delivered victim impact statements at the Central Criminal Court in Cork on Wednesday as Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (28) were sentenced to life imprisonment by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford. Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023 and January 29th, 2024. However, a jury found them both guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan’s mother, Catherine O’Flynn, his father Stephen Quilligan, and his partner, Colette O’Driscoll, on Wednesday told the court how Mr Quilligan’s death had affected them. Ms O’Flynn said the family clung on to the hope that Kieran was still alive after he disappeared from his flat in Cork city on September 1st, 2023, and that it was all just a bad dream from which they would one day wake up. “I remember the months unfolding. How could I forget? Each day the weather conditions were getting worse – it felt like there were never so many storms. I’d stare out the windows thinking ‘God love him – he is out there in all this’, while still clinging to the hope he was still alive," she said. “We were living in a world of loss, fear and hope until January 29th, 2024 when Kieran’s skeletal remains were found. Our hearts were broken in a million pieces – our worst nightmare come true,” added Ms O’Flynn, who said that if her love could have saved her son, he would still be alive. Stephen Quilligan said they knew foul play had been involved in Kieran’s disappearance, but it was not until they sat through the murder trial and heard the evidence that they realised the full horror of what had happened. “We were shocked, angry, in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened,” he said. “For the last three weeks we have sat here listening to horror stories about my son and the two defendants didn’t show one bit of remorse for what they did.” He thanked An Garda Síochána for not giving up when searching for Kieran and treating him “like a human being”. Ms O’Driscoll said she adored Kieran and they had been told before his disappearance that they were to be housed together. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long-awaited castle,” she said. Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan outlined the background to the murder. She said Long and Taylor killed Mr Quilligan in retaliation for an incident earlier on September 1st, 2023 when Mr Quilligan and another man had robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork city centre. The three men were known to each other as they were users of heroin and crack cocaine. Taylor lured Mr Quilligan from his flat on Anderson’s Quay to St Finbarr’s Place, where he was attacked by him and Long before being bundled into the boot of a Toyota Rav 4. Gardaí were able to link the vehicle to Long and tracked it driving to the Little Island area, where they dumped Mr Quilligan’s body off a farmyard. Gardaí tracked the vehicle returning there three days later, when the defendants collected and moved Mr Quilligan’s body. Garda were able to track the vehicle’s movements to Whitewell, Rostellan near Midleton. A search of the area by a cadaver dog on January 29th, 2024 led them to Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains, which had been dumped in a gravel bag in low lying forestry. Det Garda O’Sullivan said Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster was unable to give a cause of death because of the long interval between Mr Quilligan’s death and the postmortem. She testified that many of Mr Quilligan’s fractures were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record-setting run Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected decision from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all climbed to all-time highs. AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) helped push the indexes higher after an event where it highlighted a flurry of partnerships. The shares climbed to a fresh high that lifted the chipmaker's market capitalization above $5 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone. Caterpillar (CAT) shares surged to an all-time high as sales of AI power-generation equipment helped the maker of big machines beat earnings and revenue estimates. Teradyne (TER) shares also took off after the semiconductor and robotics firm posted better-than-expected results and offered an upbeat outlook as it benefited from AI demand. Fiserv (FI) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the financial tech provider missed profit and sales estimates, slashed its outlook, and shook up its executive team. Shares of Etsy (ETSY) tumbled after the online marketplace also announced a leadership change, with CEO Josh Silverman stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by President and Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares fell after the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, and other packaged foods warned current-quarter results could be hurt by price pressures, bird flu, and a fire at a peanut butter production plant. Oil and gold futures advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

New World season 10 is the game's last major update When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After a little over four years of updates, Amazon is throwing in the towel on New World. The recently launched season 10 of the ambitious fantasy MMO will be its last, and among those providing commiserations is a former World of Warcraft dev who's very aware of the current struggles. Greg Street, who served as lead systems designer on World of Warcraft for several years, posted a simple tribute on Twitter to the team behind New World. "I'm sorry for my friends at Amazon who were trying to keep the MMO dream alive," he stated. A longtime designer who’s been in the industry for over 20 years, Street is currently attempting to put out an MMORPG himself, through Fantastic Pixel Castle, for which he serves as studio head and game director. Started in 2023, the outfit has been working on a fantasy multiplayer game for some time, though earlier this month, Street revealed they were having trouble finding a publisher after a deal with NetEase fell through. I’m sorry for my friends at Amazon who were trying to keep the MMO dream aliveOctober 29, 2025 When asked about the climate of triple-A development, where we've seen numerous layoffs and canceled projects over the last couple of years, Street mentions it's possible with the right management. "I think it's sustainable with realistic budgets and timeframes. But indies are having a great moment right now," he says. Amazon cited sustainability issues in its decision to pause the rollout of additional features for New World, and the decision comes amid layoffs affecting 14,000 employees across its video game operations. Getting an MMORPG off the ground and keeping it alive are two distinct struggles, and in a world where there are already so many live-service games vying for people's time, carving out space for New World can't have been easy. The game will remain playable through 2026, per official messaging, and a minimum of six months' notice is promised before anything happens that impacts access.

Title: Nvidia's market capitalization hits $5.12 trillion — AI powerhouse is the first company in history to hit seismic milestone

The most expensive company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The market capitalization of Nvidia passed the $5 trillion mark on Wednesday, following a host of potentially lucrative deals and projects the company announced at its GPU Technology Conference event on Tuesday. The company's stock price continues to be driven by the broad interest towards artificial intelligence and Nvidia's unique position in the AI supply chain that now spans from humble chips for inference to gigawatt-scale data centers for massive AI training. At its GTC 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., Nvidia made a number of announcements that could potentially bring tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars in revenue to the company in the coming years. Among the highlights announced by Nvidia are reference designs for gargantuan gigawatt-scale AI data centers that will let newcomers to build new AI factories using Nvidia blueprints and hardware; partnership with Palantir to build an integrated stack for operational AI; the deal with Uber to use Nvidia's Level 4 AGX Drive Hyperion platform for its fleet of autonomous robotaxis as well as adoption of the same platform by Mercedes, Stellantis, Volvo, Lucid, and Foxconn; NVQLink technology to attach Nvidia GPUs to quantum computers; partnership to build AI-RAN products with Nokia; contracts to build seven AI supercomputers for the U.S. government; and plans to build AI-native 6G networks in the U.S. together with partners. The new announcements place Nvidia at the center of the large-scale AI supply chain, which will drive demand for the company's hardware and software solutions. Nvidia's AI platform comprises numerous products, including GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, NVLink switches, and Ethernet and Infiniband solutions. If one wants to build an Nvidia-based cluster or data center for AI, they will inevitably procure plenty of Nvidia-designed hardware and software to build it and operate it. While for now Nvidia supplies AI hardware to companies like AWS, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI, in the coming years, it is going to expand its total addressable market to both established players across industries (e.g., Lilly is already building its own AI data center) and new players that have yet to become significant in their realms. Even established companies are increasing their demands for AI GPUs. For example, Nvidia supplied about four million Hopper-based AI GPUs throughout the architecture's active lifetime, and shipments of Blackwell stand at six million units now and yet have to peak. With new participants entering the AI field, sales of Nvidia's hardware are poised to skyrocket. Nvidia's unique position in the growing AI supply chain places it well above other semiconductor and high-tech companies as far as market capitalization is concerned. The company at press time cost over a trillion dollars more than Apple ($4.011 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.995 trillion), nearly two trillion dollars more than Alphabet ($3.257 trillion), and two times more than Amazon ($2.444 billion). Interestingly, TSMC — the key supplier to Nvidia that produces all of its silicon — now has a market capitalization of $1.582 trillion, whereas ASML — the key supplier to TSMC — now costs $416.5 billion. Market capitalization of Nvidia's traditional rivals — AMD and Intel — stands at $429 billion and $197 billion, respectively.

Title: Trump may finally get what he wants from Fed chair. But the economy is still wobbly.
URL: https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-interest-rates-rcna240327
Time Published: 2025-10-29T15:35:46Z
Full Content:
MSNBC TV More Shows President Donald Trump received a long-awaited gift from America’s central bank today: lower interest rates for the second consecutive month. The news was delivered by one of the public officials he has most villainized throughout the course of both of his presidencies: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017. Trump lambasted Powell this week, calling him “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell” in a speech to Asian business leaders in South Korea. “We’re not going to have a Fed that’s going to raise interest rates because they’re worried about inflation in three years from now,” Trump added. It’s unclear if Trump’s rhetoric about Powell will change now that the Fed has shifted course from leaving rates unchanged. On Tuesday, the central bank’s governors voted to lower rates by 25 basis points. “The Federal Reserve’s much-needed interest rate cut only highlights how destructive the Democrat Government Shutdown is — with key government economic data releases delayed potentially indefinitely, the Federal Reserve is flying blind heading into its next meeting in December. As are the businesses, families, investors, and markets who rely on reliable and timely government data,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. Trump has frequently taken aim at the Federal Reserve chief for holding steady on interest rates as inflation continues to dog the economy — threatening to fire him and then backing off. He is actively seeking a new Fed chair to appoint once Powell’s term as chairman expires in May, engaging in an unusually public search for a replacement. The personal animus continued during Trump’s swing this week through Asia. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday about Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” Trump lambasted the Federal Reserve chair this week, calling him “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell” in a speech to Asian business leaders in South Korea. The last time the Federal Reserve dropped its funds rate was in 2024, in a series of decisions that Trump has described — without evidence — as politically motivated, coming both before and after his election. Now that the president got his wish of lower borrowing costs, economists say it’s unlikely to deliver immediate relief. Although a key inflation reading turned out to be lower than expected last week, it was still above the Fed’s 2% target, coming in a full point higher at 3%. Enduring inflation has remained a thorny issue for Trump, running counter to his campaign vows to lower the cost of living for Americans while he is in office. A majority of Americans, 74%, say that economic conditions are only “fair” or “poor,” according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center, including more than half of Republicans and 90% of Democratic respondents. William Yu, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the Fed is responding to “a problem” in the economy, specifically weak labor and housing markets. Cutting the federal funds rate is the “right decision,” Yu said. The Labor Department has yet to release its official monthly jobs report due to the ongoing government shutdown in Washington, D.C., but forecasters say the downward trend of recent months is likely to continue. Multiple corporate giants, including Amazon, Target and United Parcel Service, announced massive layoffs this week. Meanwhile, Meta, the owner of Facebook, and Rivian, an electric-vehicle company, said they also cut about 600 jobs each. In August, unemployment rose to 4.3% for the first time since October 2021. Previously, data showing a strong job market and stubborn inflation kept interest rates near their highest levels in more than a decade. Typically, a downward adjustment is a sign that the board wants to encourage economic growth. “I don’t think it will change the trajectory of the economy all that much,” said Josh Bivens, chief economist at the progressive-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Cuts “will not be any kind of game changer in the near term.” Bivens, like other analysts interviewed by MSNBC, said he believes that the White House’s tariff policies are pushing prices higher. Five Senate Republicans on Tuesday voted to block Trump’s duty on Brazil in a rare rebuke of the president. Those levies, Biven said, are more likely to continue to drive costs going into next year, rather than the federal funds rate. Yu also expressed skepticism that interest range changes will have a sizable impact on inflation, though for different reasons, including increased costs for rent, insurance premiums and medical expenses. “That is totally different, totally unrelated to monetary policy,” he said. Still, the California-based professor sees bright spots, including positive expectations for gross domestic product in the third quarter. Tech companies have kept output high, generating trillions of dollars globally so far this year. However, “very few” sectors outside tech are growing, said Jai Kedia, who studies macroeconomics at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. The persistence of elevated prices has led to some debate about the Fed’s next move. “I understand that the Fed is worried about the labor market and is trying to lower rates to boost employment,” Kedia said, “but if you look at the trade-off between employment and inflation, I think the decision to cut rates is much harder than what most people seem to be making it out to be.” The central bank’s decision comes on the cusp of a meeting between Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea. U.S. officials are optimistic that the two competitors will avoid another escalation in a roller-coaster trade war that has the potential to destabilize the global economy. Kedia pointed to “the highest tariff rates we’ve had in several decades” as the main culprit for his assessment of a “poor economic cycle.” Some companies are absorbing tariff costs, Yu noted, preventing consumers from taking the hit. “People expect that the Fed will change something and it’ll have drastic effects,” Kedia said, “but really, a 25 basis point interest rate cut isn’t going to change companies’ minds on whether they shouldn’t fire people or shouldn’t hire more.” The libertarian economist sees supply shocks as causing both unemployment and inflation to rise, and he said he believes more companies are passing along tariff costs to Americans. Nonetheless, a rate cut is precisely what Trump has lobbied for, including by floating the prospect of ousting Powell on several occasions. The Fed is considered an independent government agency, making the removal of a chair highly unusual and unprecedented. The president, as recently as Monday, mused about replacing Powell at the end of his term in May. “I think it’s the world’s easiest job, but to get it right, you have to be very smart, and we have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. The president in September appointed his former chief economist Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve. Miran is the one governor whose recommendations largely depart from his fellow board members by calling for bigger rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs help homebuyers save money on purchasing, along with other consumer lenders, an important reason why the president has pushed for a change in Fed policy. Trump has called for dramatically bigger rate cuts. With several months remaining until Trump gets his pick for a new chair, he’s still taking jabs. "We’ll appoint somebody that we all like, because we should have the lowest interest rates of any country, because without us, there are no other countries, really," he said this week.

Title: WSJ: AI Contributes to White-Collar Jobs Disappearing in Corporate America
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/10/29/wsj-ai-contributes-to-white-collar-jobs-disappearing-in-corporate-america/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T15:26:34Z
Full Content:
According to the Wall Street Journal, America’s largest employers are cutting white-collar positions at an alarming rate, leaving experienced and new workers struggling to find opportunities in a stagnant job market. AI plays a role in the elimination of some white-collar jobs, with some CEOs directly crediting the technology with reducing headcount. The Wall Street Journal reports that the landscape of white-collar employment in the United States is undergoing a dramatic shift as companies embrace AI and prioritize efficiency. Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been eliminated in recent months, with major players like Amazon, United Parcel Service, Target, Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, Booz Allen Hamilton, and General Motors announcing significant layoffs. This trend is leaving both experienced professionals and new graduates with fewer options and increased competition for the remaining positions. Behind this wave of job cuts lies a combination of factors, including the adoption of AI technologies that can handle tasks previously performed by well-compensated white-collar workers, investor pressure to streamline operations, political uncertainty, and rising costs. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of remaining managers and employees are being redefined, with heavier workloads and less time for individual attention becoming the norm. In some cases, corporate leaders are bragging about AI replacing humans, such as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Breitbart News previously reported that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that white-collar job cuts were coming due to AI: Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. The warning comes amidst growing excitement and concern about the potential of AI to disrupt the job market. Some industry leaders, such as Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, have predicted that unemployment could spike to 20 percent in the next few years due to the rapid development of AI technology. The impact of these layoffs on affected workers is profound. Many find themselves struggling to secure new employment in their fields, despite years of experience and qualifications. Some, like Chris Reed, a 33-year-old former tech sales professional, have been forced to take jobs outside their areas of expertise to support their families. Reed, who was laid off a year ago, applied to over 1,000 jobs before accepting a position selling cars, a decision that has taken a toll on his work-life balance and family relationships. As white-collar opportunities dwindle, the demand for front-line, blue-collar, and specialized workers is growing. Companies report shortages in trade, healthcare, hospitality, and construction roles, while simultaneously cutting positions in consulting, management, retail, and finance. This shift is further compounded by the increasing use of AI to perform tasks in accounting and fraud monitoring. The changing job market is also affecting entry-level hiring, with recent graduates facing heightened competition and fewer offers despite submitting more applications. Kobe Baker, a 23-year-old Baylor University graduate, struggled to find a foothold in the New York City job market before eventually accepting a customer service position. Many young people are finding it increasingly difficult to achieve independence due to the lack of available opportunities. Read more at the Wall Street Journal here.

The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday’s open, comes just three months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation. The company’s shares (NVDA) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has gained about 50% in 2025 and has been near or at the top of the S&P 500’s best-performing stocks for years as investment in artificial intelligence continues to fuel the chipmaker’s meteoric rise. Boosting Nvidia’s stock Wednesday: hopes for discussions between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that open up China’s market to Nvidia’s high-end AI chips. On Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock rose after CEO Jensen Huang presented a vision of Nvidia’s future in which the company’s chips would be placed in everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars. Huang, in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington on Tuesday was effusive in his praise for Trump. Nvidia’s AI chips are essential to powering the data centers that run the technology. The company is central to the AI boom not just because of those chips that are making it tons of money, but also because of the investments it’s pouring into other major players. On Tuesday, another tech giant — Apple — breached the $4 trillion benchmark. It’s a sign that that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company has fallen behind in the AI race. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AI leader OpenAI recently announced a major new tie-up, which will have the ChatGPT maker purchase billions of dollars’ worth of chips in exchange for a $100 billion investment from Nvidia that will be made over time. Nvidia also announced a $5 billion investment in beleaguered chipmaker Intel. But the circular spending spree, paired with the industry’s eye-popping growth rates and the lack of clarity around the return on AI investments, has raised concerns that the AI market may be a bubble waiting to burst. Still, Nvidia executives said during the company’s August earnings call that it estimates it will benefit from as much as $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia raked in nearly $26 billion in net income. All you need to know about Ghana's new vehicle number plates | BizTech: Copyright © 1994 - 2025 GhanaWeb.

Title: Amazon’s New World and Middle-earth Dreams Crumble into Dust as the Destruction of the Video Game Industry Continues

Full Content:
It is not every day when you get to witness a disregard for a cherished classic that also demonstrates hubris and a blind ignorance of MMO history, but occasionally you get interview like that. And it is less common to then get to see the whole thing blown up. I am referring to the GamesIndustry.biz interview with Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann of a couple years back in which he went on about the company’s plans for a Middle-earth MMO, blithely declaring that people would move to their title from LOTRO because it would be a better game and that you if wanted something that adhered to the books you should go read the books. Amazon was going to make a game first, and something to do with the Middle-earth lore second, seeming to devalue the impact the lore might have on the game and its appeal, something which might make one ask why they would bother licensing the IP if it was being a good game that mattered. At the time the idea was ascendant once more with Amazon because the Embracer Group had bought the Middle-earth IP and was looking to exploit it, no questions asked. Since then we had not heard much. Not until yesterday. Here they come again Yesterday Amazon announced that it was laying off 14,000 workers (and possibly as many as 30,000 ongoing) and is going to embrace AI more fully, two things no doubt aimed to boost the company’s stock price. There is nothing Wall Street loves more right now that unemployed tech workers and the fantasy that they can all be replaced by the hallucinating plagiarism machine that is AI. As part of that Amazon Game Studios was a direct target in the layoffs, with the locations in California, San Diego and Irvine, both reported to be hard hit. Neither location now exists as an option on Amazon’s hiring site, though that may only mean that there are no open positions. Still, reports are that Amazon’s shot at a game based on The Lord of the Rings has reached its end. We will never see if Amazon could make a better game that LOTRO, how loose and fast they would have been with the lore, and if LOTRO players would have migrated to the new title in any numbers. Their hubris will not be tested and LOTRO remains unchallenged. This also means the end of development for Amazon’s New World MMO, which struggled through a problematic launch which saw the company spending most of the game’s first year fixing problems and implanting standard industry features like a test server where players could go through new features and changes before they were pushed to production, the “test in production” methodology that the studio initially adopted being one of the key problems with the game in the early months. Amazon has pledged to keep the game going through 2026… but if you wanted to play it, I would suggest getting started sooner rather than later. This divestiture from video games isn’t hugely surprising. Amazon didn’t buy their way into video games due to any passion for the industry. Jeff Bezos isn’t a gamer. They did it because video games, as an industry, had a really good decade. Between 2011 and 2020 the line kept going up for the industry, peaking dramatically during Covid. And when the video game industry ended its golden run, a lot of companies started cutting back. Amazon has been particularly callous in its management of its so-called Amazon Game Studios. Cancellations and layoffs were already a regular thing. This is just “the big one,” the message that Amazon is no longer at all serious about video games. So Amazon is just following the current trajectory of implosion that the video game industry has been facing in the post-Covid downturn where we can no longer use the term “decimate” as that technically means “one in ten” and we’re probably past that. The drumbeat of layoffs continue to hit the industry, led by Microsoft and its regular culling off staff to help XBox head Phil Spencer keep his obscene annual bonus coming. Just last week Netflix purged its game development staff at Boss Fight Entertainment. And more is expected to come, especially with EA set to be torn asunder in the name of wealth extraction once Saudi Arabia grabs what they want from the company as part of their acquisition plan to whitewash their bloodthirsty regime by becoming an esports hub. Part of the EA plan is to fully embrace AI, a plan that companies like Krafton, makers of Subnautica and PUBG, are also adopting. AI means fewer staff in theory. We will see what pushing development tasks to AI means in practice. More money for AI companies for sure, and probably worse choices for consumers. As part of Amazon’s announcement, they also declared that they are going to go big on AI, and have not been at all shy about how it will replace jobs at the company. No layoffs yet at the AI game group, which recently launched Courtroom Chaos, a game in which an AI driven Snoop Dogg does his routine. Courtroom Chaos – Now the pinnacle of Amazon Game Studios This is something your mother would probably enjoy, a chance to laugh at a black man transgressing the norms of “polite society” or something. That is Snoop Dogg’s shtick for sure these days, and I am sure it pays well, but it isn’t a serious video game with any depth. It is an attempt to automate Cards Against Humanity. But you can try it for free on Amazon’s Luna platform if you are an Amazon Prime member. So what happens next? Amazon has resisted answering any questions about the once mighty Middle-earth title. They would like that all to just go away please. Embracer Group will have to find somebody else willing to pay for the rights to do whatever they want with the IP. Maybe Amazon can get Ian McKellen to voice a Courtroom Chaos as Gandalf? There were also a couple other unannounced titles Amazon was working on that are no doubt dust in the wind at this point. Then there is New World. That title is a dead man walking if ever there was one. We all know it. It is just a question of how much longer it will last. I am surprised, what with the super duper AWS architecture that the company bragged about, that they are going to pass up an opportunity to do something like rent 4 player New World servers to people. They are always hungry for some AWS revenue. But maybe their AWS model wasn’t as flexible as they suggested. And even if it was, that sort of move would require some prep work, and Amazon isn’t investing any more in big games. There are also another batch of game developers looking for their next job in an industry that has been shedding such positions for almost five years now. Amazon says all laid off staff will be able to apply for other jobs within Amazon, but that seems unlikely to pay off. There are certainly developer jobs outside of game development, if you want to work in a company that is trying to be the “worlds largest startup,” their words. That translates into small teams, long hours, unrealistic timelines, changing goals, and a constant anxiety about the safety of your position. I have known five people who went to word for Amazon. Four moved on in under six months, all in software developer roles. The fifth works at the Amazon warehouse seasonally to make a few bucks in retirement. Not exactly the career oriented model for most of us. Related: It’s curious that Amazon have declined either to make a statement or answer direct questions about the LotR game. They’ve been very happy to give chapter and verse on all the other MMOs they have running. It makes me think the fate of the in-development title isn’t finalized yet. Perhaps they plan to sell it on? Or even finish it. I have (Another) post about AI brewing, the gist of which is that a lot of people are in for a rude awakening. Probably on both sides of the love it or hate it divide. I bookmarked a couple of articles from gamesindustry, both of which have specific examples of companies that have used AI for the reducing staffing/speeding up production purpose it seems to be mainly being promoted these days. It did not go well for either of them. I have yet to read a report about any company that’s tried it for whom it proved more useful than where they were before. On the other hand, I read another piece at GI today, which made the excellent point that what AI might actually be useful for in game development is making new types of games that currently don’t exist, rather than making the same ones faster and cheaper. I think that might also be true, although if the result is a whole lot of Snoop Dogalikes I can’t say I’m thrilled by the prospect. Anyway, I’d better save that for the post. Shame about New World. I always liked it. LikeLike One of my current job tasks is to be part of a test team trying to us AI to build apps. These are pretty simple web based apps. We started with using some requirements I wrote for previous apps that were already built… and AI will go down every rabbit hole it finds. It has been a pretty graphic example of how AI doesn’t understand anything in the way a human does. Getting it to realize something is out of scope can be like arguing with a curious toddler. My current operating theory based on a couple months of this is that the best case scenario is that communication with AI will become another programming language of its own and that you will eat up as much time getting prompts exactly right as you would have with a competent developer just writing the code in whatever coding language you have chosen. I will have to check on that GI article about “new types” of games. I am pretty skeptical that AI can do anything new unless you plan to lead it by the hand. LikeLike It’s not a whole article. That was me being lazy. It’s a section of a report on the games/comics convention that was on in London recently. It was the bit towards the end with the YouTube video for an actual game that’s supposed to come out next year. It’s hardly original but it gives a hint of where AI games could go. LikeLike The devs that were let go verified the entire LOTR team was let go so no way they finish it. LikeLike I have a theory on the current games landscape. I think that between WoW and Minecraft and their multi billions, the industry has been in a bubble for the past 20 years or so. It feels like we are finally getting to the point where big companies see that the multi billion dollar games are rare enough not to bet on, so they are winding down their investment. There is still a good industry to be had among the medium sized and small/indie houses, but for the big non-dedicated companies (MS, Amazon), AI feels like a desperation move to make games the gold rush they used to be, but it won’t pan out and they will wind down further. It’s a contraction, but it will make the industry healthier in the long run to remove those only here for the bucks. LikeLike Absolutely provable via the data, video games started a run after the Dot Com bubble burst that ran through to the end of Covid, which helped it hit peaks we’ll not see again, with only the mortgage default crisis of 2008 to 2012 slowed down. There is an absolute ton of money sitting in low yield but very safe government bonds that is always looking for any safe bet for a better yield. This “giant pool of money” was what drove the mortgage default crisis, because mortgages were safe… but there were not enough of them relative to the potential investors, so brokers started issue no income/no asset verification mortgages. That money, which was over a trillion dollars back in 2008, is always looking for some better return and is what drives all the bubbles. VR, the metaverse, crypto, and now AI. That went into video games pretty big in the back half of the teens and went on a frenzy on seeing the Covid era numbers. And then we all went back outside. LikeLike WoW isn’t even really a big dollar game. It’s big to us as MMORPG fans, but its not anywhere near titles like CoD or the real kings: mobile game giants. In comparison; WoW is actually an expensive game to keep going. That’s the landscape shift in game development; hard complex games to develop and run live services for are losing out to simple mobile cash generator games. LikeLike WoW has crossed the billion dollar annual revenue line, or hovered near it, for most of its life. That sagged for a while, but was revived with WoW Classic. And I would argue that it is no more expensive to keep up than a live service game like the annual COD titles, which also cost a lot more to produce every year than a WoW expansion. That success continues to entice companies. Amazon didn’t throw itself into building two MMOs and publishing a few more, because MMOs are small potatoes and not worth the effort. Amazon just thought reproducing WoW numbers would be easy, like every company since 2005 or so. That said, WoW is an extreme outlier. Most MMOs are under $100 million in annual revenue. That is enough to support a small company that is careful with its resource and can be a nice thing to keep off the books. EA put its MMOs under Broadsword because it liked the revenue, but not the hit to margins so they made up another company so they could just claim the income. Shared world MMORPGs are a niche market. LikeLike If Amazon could use robots –both warehouse and flying– to package, ship, and deliver, they wouldn’t have more than 5-10 people in those warehouses. The same thing goes for data centers: if they could get away with it, Jeff Bezos would utilize everything in his power to have robots do it all. The drawback is, of course, what to do with all of those workers that are being displaced. But to folks like Bezos, that’s “not my problem”. What’s more likely, however, is that the AI bubble bursts and wipes out a large portion of these huge companies with it. LikeLike The other problem that no-one seems to want to address is if all those people are removed from the workforce, who picks up the spending slack they leave behind them? It’s all very well having robots do all the work for free but they aren’t going to make very effective consumers. Also, wasn’t Amazon actually using drones for delivery at one point? Or did that turn out to be just as stupid an idea as it always seemed at the time? LikeLike I was thinking about the economic losses caused by mass displacement of employees, but I’m sure Bezos and the others don’t care. They’ll have made their money so they don’t need to worry about it. Yes, Amazon is (still) looking into drones for delivery, but right now drones in the US have to be registered with the FAA if they go above a certain weight limit (which is very easy to breach; the drone I own is at the weight limit and the thing is incredibly light). If Bezos wanted to circumvent that, he’d have to bribe a lot more people to make it happen. Then he’d also have to deal with all of those folks with guns who’d shoot down drones flying near their property because “they’re spying on me!” (Before you laugh, the reason why I’ve not taken my own drone out much at all to inspect my gutters is that I do have neighbors like that.) LikeLike “WoW isn’t even really a big dollar game. It’s big to us as MMORPG fans, but it’s not anywhere near titles like CoD or the real kings: mobile game giants.” Agreed. But I do think that WoW/Minecraft contributed to an influx of people to those games also. In my wider theory I call those “normie games” because there has been Madden and Call of Duty for years but the audiences are minimally intermingled. Mobile games are yet another phenomenon that didn’t exist when WoW launched. They are the biggest wild card because as you said, cheap to develop and I think most people play them to some extent. And they aren’t usually live-in games like PC or normie console titles, so there is infinite appetite. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Nvidia’s $1 Billion Bet Turns Nokia Into The New AI Contender

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nokia stock (NYSE: NOK) is back in the spotlight. The Finnish telecom giant’s shares surged over 20% this week after Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a $1 billion investment for approximately a 2.9% stake, forming a new alliance to develop AI-driven networking and 6G infrastructure. For investors, this is not merely a fleeting headline. It’s an opportunity to reevaluate a company often viewed as a legacy player. With a market capitalization of $42 billion, Nokia delivers mobile, fixed, and cloud network solutions from 2G to 5G, and now, it’s seeking to position itself as a link between telecom and AI infrastructure. Let’s analyze how it compares. Nevertheless, if you seek upward potential with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has substantially outshined its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What explains this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, minimizing significant fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at – After A Hot Run For Gold, Will Stocks Take The Lead Again? At first glance, Nokia does not seem to be a bargain. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41x, compared to the S&P 500’s 24. Its price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow ratios — at 2.2 and 33.3, respectively — also surpass market averages. This indicates that optimism has likely set in. The Nvidia partnership may warrant a premium, but the market is evidently betting on strong execution ahead. For investors, this implies that the narrative now rests on whether Nokia can provide sustained growth in a sector characterized by fierce competition and slim margins. Nokia’s growth record has been inconsistent. Over the last three years, revenue actually declined at an average rate of nearly 6% per year, significantly trailing the S&P 500’s positive trend. The positive news? Indicators of improvement are evident. In the last twelve months, Nokia’s revenue increased by almost 6%, reaching $20 billion, with its most recent quarter showing an 11.6% year-over-year increase. This upturn, bolstered by AI-related momentum and increased network demand, is one of the reasons the stock has attracted new investor interest. However, the more significant challenge will be sustainability. Can Nokia transform temporary order surges into long-term, profitable growth? That remains an unanswered question. Despite increasing sales, Nokia’s profitability lags significantly behind competitors. Operating margins hover around 3.7%, compared to the S&P 500’s 18.7%. Its net income margin, approximately 4.7%, presents a similar narrative — respectable for a hardware-heavy industry, but far from robust. Cash flow generation is somewhat stronger, with a 9.6% operating cash flow margin, or about $1.9 billion over the previous year. Still, Nokia must significantly increase margins if it aims to be recognized as a genuine AI-infrastructure contender rather than just a cyclical telecom supplier. Where Nokia excels is in its balance sheet strength. Debt stands at only $4.1 billion with a modest debt-to-equity ratio close to 10%. The company also has $6.1 billion in cash, approximately 17% of total assets, which is considerably higher than the average S&P 500 peer. In a capital-intensive sector, that financial cushion is crucial. It provides Nokia the capacity to invest in AI networking, support research and development, and manage downturns without incurring major dilution or distress. Nokia’s stock history illustrates a narrative of vulnerability in the face of market shocks. It plummeted 54% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn, significantly steeper than the S&P 500’s 25% drop, and it has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels. The crash of 2008 was even harsher, with the stock dropping nearly 79% and never regaining those heights. On a positive note, Nokia rebounded swiftly from the 2020 pandemic sell-off, regaining losses in just 81 days, outpacing the broader market. However, overall, the company's crisis resilience has fallen short, serving as a reminder that investor sentiment can shift dramatically when fundamentals weaken. Nokia’s new collaboration with Nvidia could signify a pivotal moment, allowing the company to reposition itself as an AI-era infrastructure leader instead of a struggling telecom supplier. Nevertheless, the figures still narrate a mixed story: high valuation, uneven growth, thin margins, yet a robust balance sheet. For the time being, investors ought to approach this as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround. Nvidia’s billion-dollar endorsement provides Nokia with new credibility — but only consistent execution and margin enhancement will convert that promise into lasting value. You may wish to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presents a flexible strategy to exploit favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Nvidia just became the first company in the world to be worth $5 trillion, just four months after it made history by hitting a $4 trillion market capitalization. The company owed that last bump to a series of high-profile announcements that CEO Jensen Huang made at the first Washington D.C. edition of its conference, GTC, and the raging hype cycle around companies working in AI. On Tuesday, Huang announced that Nvidia would partner with: The company also delighted investors when Huang announced that Nvidia is expecting half a trillion dollars in orders for its Blackwell and Rubin chips through next year. Also helping Nvidia’s case is its close ties to the Trump administration, which was on full display at the GTC in D.C. Huang spent a good chunk of his time praising the administration and the President personally, saying that “no one works harder” than him. Huang also told the crowd that he is jetting off to South Korea to meet the President on his Asia diplomacy tour. Trump is supposed to have a key trade meeting with China’s Xi Jinping in South Korea, and the outcome of that meeting is likely to be of great concern to Nvidia. Perhaps the only thing that has been weighing on Nvidia in the market the past few months has been the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Nvidia has been caught in the crossfire of that dispute many times. The tech giant is banking on a trade deal that would allow it to resume selling its chips in China, in what was once one of its strongest markets. Gaining Trump’s confidence is key to doing that. The market value of the biggest names in AI is off the charts, and Nvidia leads the charge. There are only three companies in the world that are worth more than $4 trillion, and they are all tech giants buoyed by the AI trade. Microsoft was the second company to cross the benchmark after Nvidia in July, and Apple became the third yesterday. This meteoric rise in value only makes fears of an AI bubble worse. Not only are most experts raising concerns that AI companies are overvalued, but their outsized influence on the market and the U.S. economy makes any downturn correction dangerous. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that “equity market valuations appear stretched” for AI companies, stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta) was at its highest concentration in 50 years. The U.S. market is banking on an unprecedented boom in AI demand, and Nvidia is considered the darling of the AI trade. They are in charge of supplying the chips that are at the core of this infrastructure build-out. But if demand does not shape up as expected or if the build-out runs into any material bottlenecks, like supply chain problems or a lack of energy and resources, then all this valuation (and everything attached to it) is at risk of coming crashing down.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Google Parent Alphabet's Stock To Move After Earnings

Google parent Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, with traders betting on a sizable move in the tech giant's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Alphabet (GOOGL) stock could move about 6% in either direction by the end of this week. A move of that size off Tuesday's close near $268 would push shares to about $283 at the high end, in what would represent a new all-time high for the stock, or drag them down to about $252, where they were last week. Alphabet shares posted modest gains in the range of 1% to 3% in the days after posting its results in three of the four past quarters. However, they tumbled 7% the day after the company released its fourth-quarter results in February, when the tech giant announced big spending plans for this year. As with many of its Magnificent 7 peers due to report this week, investors will be watching for Alphabet's progress with its AI goals, and anticipation of an abnormally large move in its stock could reflect either extreme optimism or pessimism heading into the earnings. Shares of Alphabet have added over 40% of their value in 2025, making it one of the best-performing Magnificent 7 stocks for the year so far, behind AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Still, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to three neutral ratings, though the stock has already blown past their mean target of $254 with its recent gains. The tech giant is projected to report earnings per share of $2.26 for the third quarter on a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue to $99.9 billion, according to consensus estimates.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After a career spanning two decades at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, I gained an institutional perspective on dividend stock investing. My tenure at these premier Wall Street firms exposed me to fundamental analysis, credit evaluation, and risk management practices, which directly translate into selecting quality dividend-paying companies. Having witnessed firsthand the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath—including the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, from which I was fortunately spared as I had left both firms by 2004—I developed a keen appreciation for balance sheet strength, sustainable payout ratios, and the importance of dividends as a stabilizing force during market turbulence. By analyzing cash flow generation, capital allocation strategies, and management quality, I can identify companies with durable competitive advantages and the financial discipline to maintain and grow their dividends through economic cycles. Early in my career, I realized that dividend investing is not merely an income strategy, but also a comprehensive framework for building wealth through companies that consistently return capital to shareholders while maintaining financial stability. Five top companies are the bedrock and pinnacle for dividend investors. All are the kind of stocks that growth and income investors can buy now, tomorrow, next week, or next year and hold for the long term. All are rated Buy at top Wall Street firms that we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973 to 2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is the world’s fourth-largest telecommunications company, measured by revenue. The legacy telecommunications company has been undergoing a lengthy restructuring process while maintaining a solid dividend of 4.24%. Seventeen analysts have given the stock a Buy rating, indicating comprehensive Wall Street support. AT&T provides a range of telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. Its Communications segment offers wireless voice and data communications services. AT&T sells through its company-owned stores, agents, and third-party retail stores: AT&T also provides: Additionally, this segment provides residential customers with broadband fiber and legacy telephony voice communication services. It markets its communications services and products under: The company’s Latin America segment provides wireless services in Mexico and video services throughout the region. This segment markets its services and products under the AT&T and Unefon brands. Raymond James has a Strong Buy rating with a $33 price target for the stock. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1892. It remains a top long-time holding of Warren Buffett, who owns a massive 400 million shares and pays a dependable 2.94% dividend. Coca-Cola is the world’s largest beverage company, offering consumers more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, one of the world’s most valuable and recognizable brands, the company’s portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including: Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees, juices, and juice drinks. Through the world’s most extensive beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the company’s beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. It’s also important to remember that the company owns 16.7% of Monster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST), which continues to deliver big numbers. UBS has a Buy rating with an $80 target price. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) manages an industry-leading portfolio of resources and is one of the world’s largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies. The decline in oil prices presents investors with an excellent entry point, and they will likely seize the opportunity to secure a strong 3.48% dividend yield. Exxon is the world’s largest international integrated oil and gas company, exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada/South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania. The energy giant also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics, as well as specialty products. Additionally, the company transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Top Wall Street analysts expect the company to remain a key beneficiary in a stable oil price environment. Most remain very optimistic about the company’s sharp positive inflection in capital allocation strategy, particularly in the Upstream portfolio and its leverage to a further demand recovery. Exxon offers greater Downstream/Chemicals exposure than its peers. Exxon completed its purchase of oil shale giant Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock transaction valued at $59.5 billion in 2024. The deal created the largest U.S. oilfield producer and guarantees a decade of low-cost production. UBS has a Buy rating on the shares with an $80 target price. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Title: Netflix Stock To $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has shown remarkable performance, increasing by 45% in the last 12 months and currently trades at approximately $1,100 for each share. This surge has been fueled by the company's efforts to tackle password sharing and the introduction of its advertising-supported streaming option, although the stock has experienced a minor sell-off in recent times. After reaching a peak of roughly $1,340 in June, it has declined due to Q3 earnings that fell short of expectations, resulting in Netflix revenues and margins coming in below projections. Despite the recent drop, the stock still trades at around 45 times the forecasted earnings. We think the stock faces significant downside risk at such high levels. With increasing macroeconomic uncertainties and indications that subscriber growth may decelerate, investors might be overlooking possible risks. In our opinion, the stock could decline drastically — potentially falling below $500 per share. A 50% correction may seem drastic, but it would not be without precedent. This has occurred before and could likely happen again. However, any potential correction would not necessarily arise from a breakdown in Netflix’s fundamentals, but rather from a recalibration of its valuation multiple as growth begins to stabilize. Investing in single stocks can be risky, yet there is significant value in utilizing a broader, diversified strategy. If you're looking for some upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) — HQ has outperformed its benchmark, a blend of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential — consider what long-term portfolio performance might look like if you incorporated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ's performance metrics. Netflix's subscriber growth could eventually decelerate as significant measures like the crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported plans have typically been implemented across major markets. These initiatives were substantial strategic changes aimed at creating new revenue streams and enlarging the user base after growth stagnated following the pandemic. However, demand may have been pulled forward that might have otherwise emerged over the next few years, leading to softer subscriber additions in the future. The company’s intent to cease reporting subscriber figures from 2025 might also reflect internal expectations for slower growth ahead. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid user count to nearly 302 million by the end of the year, marking a record annual increase that considerably propelled the stock’s upward trajectory. Growth was mainly stimulated by the crackdown on password sharing, which incentivized users to either purchase extra member access or create new accounts. Simultaneously, the ad-supported tier gained substantial traction, with Netflix reporting last quarter that it had over 94 million ad-supported users. While Netflix is becoming more efficient in monetizing its ads, subscriber growth has been a fundamental driver of the company’s expansion. With these significant growth levers now mostly exhausted, Netflix may find it challenging to maintain its present momentum, which could have repercussions on the stock’s performance. Economic uncertainty and rising costs could also pressure Netflix, which heavily relies on consumer spending. The introduction of tariffs on essential trading partners is already causing inflation in the U.S. to rise. This may decrease disposable income and, in turn, potentially weaken consumer spending. This situation could be detrimental for Netflix, which depends on discretionary income. Additionally, Netflix’s plans have become pricier, with its premium plan now priced at $25 a month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This may result in a slowdown in new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content expenses are set to increase as it delves deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, which typically incur higher production and licensing costs. Although the recent decline in Q3 operating margin to 28% — against a predicted 31.5% — largely resulted from an unforeseen tax dispute in Brazil, margins may remain susceptible as spending pressures accumulate. For the entirety of 2025, Netflix now anticipates an operating margin of 29%, slightly down from its earlier forecast of 30%. NFLX stock has experienced slightly better performance compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent market downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go In A Market Crash presents a detailed analysis of how S&P stocks performed during and after prior market crashes. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2008 Global Financial Crisis But the risk isn’t confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider events like earnings reports, company updates, or outlook modifications. Check out NFLX Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from significant dips in the past. At the current share price of $1,100, Netflix trades at approximately 45 times consensus earnings for 2025 and around 34 times the consensus earnings for 2026, which is high compared to historical standards. In contrast, the stock was trading at approximately 20 times earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial results have been robust, markets can be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the distant future. In Netflix’s situation, the prevailing assumption is that the company will sustain its strong sequence of subscriber acquisitions and likely grow revenues comfortably in double digits. Nevertheless, there’s a real chance that Netflix will soon witness a slowdown in growth, as the combined advantages of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, all while economic uncertainties continue to rise in the U.S. Essentially, the downside risk here lies less in Netflix’s business viability and more in the extent to which investors are prepared to pay for its next phase of slower, more mature growth. Worried about Netflix stock's high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as indicated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Amazon fires staffers via early-morning text messages during round of 14K job cuts: report

Some of the 14,000 workers Amazon began firing this week learned of their fate through an impersonal text-message blast, according to a new report. Amazon sent affected employees two text messages early Tuesday morning as the e-commerce giant launched a round of corporate job cuts, according to people familiar with the matter and screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One message urged employees to check their personal and work emails before coming into the office – in an effort to prevent laid-off staffers from showing up to work and discovering their badges no longer worked, according to the report. Just to be sure, Amazon sent a second text message directing employees to call a help desk if they had not received “an email message about your role,” Business Insider reported. Amazon declined to comment. Tuesday’s layoffs were the latest in Amazon’s efforts to “reduce bureaucracy” across its white-collar workforce, Beth Galetti, Amazon’s executive in charge of human resources, said in a memo to staffers. “While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she stated. Some managers were told Monday to complete training sessions on how to brief laid-off employees once the emails were sent out, sources told Reuters. Several teams were impacted, including ones working on HR, devices, services and operations, according to the outlet. Impacted employees will be able to look for a new role internally. Otherwise, they will be offered severance pay, outplacement services and health benefits, according to Galetti’s memo. In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office-based workforce – over the coming weeks, sources told Reuters. Another round of corporate cuts is expected in January, after the busy holiday shopping season, two people familiar with the matter told the New York Times. Amazon has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since Andy Jassy took over the helm from the company’s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, in 2021. In June, Jassy urged employees to embrace automation and “help us reinvent the company.” He said new tech could create new job opportunities – though he also admitted it could bring “efficiency gains” by helping to reduce the overall workforce. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” Jassy wrote at the time. Amazon has already embraced robots and automation in its warehouses. The company plans to avoid hiring more than 600,000 warehouse employees in the coming years thanks to the new tech – even as it expects to sell twice as many items over the same period, according to a New York Times report. Amazon called the article “an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans.” In its most recent quarter, Amazon reported $18 billion in profit and ramped up its spending on AI data centers. Capital expenses, which include data centers, are expected to push past $120 billion this year – up nearly 50% from last year. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti wrote in her Tuesday memo. But “the world is changing quickly” and Amazon is focused on operating “more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership” to take advantage of AI opportunities, the exec explained.

Title: Amazon And Target Job Cuts Reveal How AI Is Reshaping The Retail Workforce

ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Retail job losses are surging, with Amazon and Target cutting nearly 32,000 corporate jobs combined, signaling a major industry restructuring. These early cuts, three times last year's pace, are driven by poor corporate performance, rising tariffs, and the growing impact of AI on administrative and managerial roles. Retail job losses are running three times ahead of last year’s pace through September, according to employment advisory firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Now Amazon and Target are becoming part of the broader trend. Each just announced plans to slash its corporate workforce up to 10%, with 31,800 jobs on the line. While the scale of job cuts differs by company size – and Amazon’s cutbacks cover more than retail-related positions – the losses within the retail sector are substantial. Coming this early in the season, well ahead of the typical post-holiday layoff peak in January and February, these cuts signal broader restructuring across one of the nation’s largest employment sectors. While different reasons are given for the layoffs, they collectively point to a structural weakness in the retail industry. The retail industry faces the perfect storm of poor corporate performance, tariff headwinds raising costs, and the growing power of AI to perform routine administrative and managerial tasks. In related news, Carter’s, the baby and children’s apparel company noted for the Carter’s and OshKosh B’Gosh brands, announced it will layoff 300 corporate staffers before the end of the year – 15% of its corporate workforce – and close 150 underperforming stores in North America over the next three years. The number of store employees affected was not revealed. Tariffs are blamed for much of the forced cost-cutting, with duties rising from $110 million in fiscal 2024 to between $200 million and $250 million this year. Currently, about 16 million Americans are employed in retail, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, now on hold due to the government shutdown. Nearly half (46%) hold frontline sales-related positions, while roughly one-fourth are in management, business, and financial roles (13%) or provide office/administrative support (10%) to those on the front lines. The rest are involved in other aspects of retail, most especially in production, transportation, and warehousing functions (23%). Overall, Challenger, Gray and Christmas reports retailers have cut 86,233 jobs through September – less than 1% of total employment – but more troubling, this year’s job cuts are up from 28,440 through the first nine months of 2024, a 203% increase. Even more concerning, U.S. employers across the board have cut just shy of one million jobs, up 55% from the first three-quarters of last year. This makes 2025 year-to-date total job losses the fifth-highest in the 36 years Challenger has been reporting this data. Hiring plans are also down 58% year-over-year to just over 200,000 new jobs, largely due to a sharp cutback in retail seasonal hiring. Through September, employer hiring plans are at their lowest point since 2009, during the Great Recession. In effect, many of the nation’s industries are dealing with the same factors that are taking away jobs in retail. “Right now, we’re dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases, and a transformative new technology,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s labor expert, in a statement. “Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,” While he believes a much-hoped-for interest rate cut could help stabilize the job market in the fourth quarter, the other factors impacting the labor market, in general, and retail in particular, are not going away and could get worse. According to numerous reports, Amazon is preparing to cut up to 30,000 corporate positions or about 10% of the corporate workforce. However, a blog post from Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience and technology, stated only about 14,000 roles were on the immediate chopping block. Amazon reports on Thursday, so we may learn more about the layoff plans. If Amazon’s layoffs reach the 30,000 mark, it will be the company’s largest restructuring in history after letting 27,000 people go in 2023. It would also rank among the highest corporate layoffs over the last 25 years. In Galetti’s blog post, the layoffs are explained in familiar corporate talking points about streamlining bureaucracy and reallocating resources to better meet current and future customers’ needs. However, reading between the lines, they are largely pinned on AI. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” she wrote. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” GlobalData’s Neil Saunders reads the news as a “deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce,” noting the company has become more complex and layered over the years. He applauds the company for moving quickly in the face of rising costs affecting corporations across the board, yet he sees the restructuring as “a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” After Target announced plans last Thursday to eliminate 1,800 corporate jobs, including laying off 1,000 workers and closing 800 open job slots, pink slips went out on Tuesday to affected employees. Putting the blame on the usual suspects, in-coming CEO Michael Fiddelke wrote in a staff memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal, “The truth is, the complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” It may be true that Target’s headquarters has become lethargic due to increased complexity in the corporate ranks, but the deeper truth is that Target has been hampered by 11 consecutive quarters of falling or weak comparable sales growth. While some of the blame for poor performance can be attributed to outside economic and competitive forces, that is likely not the largest part. Target’s controversial Pride Month offerings in 2023 sparked protests that turned off many culturally conservative shoppers. Then, earlier this year, the company decided to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion program (DEI), which raised the ire of many other shoppers, who have since abandoned the retailer amid calls to boycott it. Placer.ai, which tracks retail foot traffic, reports Target’s footfall has declined every month since January, including a 7.6% drop in September. Since boycotts were called February 28, Target’s average daily foot traffic has been off by 4.1% from the previous year, while Walmart’s has risen 7.2% in the same time period. The direction of change at Target has hurt employee morale, particularly after its DEI reversal. A company-wide survey earlier this year found about 40% of the 260,000 employees surveyed said they didn’t have confidence in the company’s future. No retailer can be expected to pull out of a sales tailspin with such a high level of dissatisfaction in its ranks. Hoped-for change emerged when longtime CEO Brian Cornell announced his retirement and Target-lifer Michael Fiddelke, noted for his financial expertise, previous efficiency initiatives and an advocate of technology transformation, would replace him this coming February 1. However, Cornell, chiefly responsible for the company’s unravelling, won’t be exiting the company but will move up to executive chair of the board. GlobalData’s Saunders is dismayed by what’s going on at Target, calling for a need to change the corporate culture. “Leadership has been in seeming denial about many of the challenges and has not been nearly open enough about them with either staff or stakeholders,” he said. The culture challenges are likely to be further exacerbated by the layoff news. “The job cuts will dampen morale at a company where the mood is already somber. That in turn will raise a question in many minds: why does the CEO who presided over the mess Target is now in get elevated to the position of Chairman, when so many others will lose their roles?” The story of these two companies – Amazon and Target – collectively reveals shared problems in retail, including rising costs, increased complexity and customers abandoning previously favored status brands for alternatives. While retailers look to consumer-facing AI as a way to re-engage customers – Amazon’s Rufus and “Buy For Me” AI shopping assistant, Target’s AI-powered “Bullseye Gift Finder” and Walmart’s “Instant Checkout” on ChatGPT – it is also enabling retailers to cut the headquarters’ fat. AI can increasingly do much of the work faster and more effectively than people. “The discussion about AI taking jobs, or at least good jobs, is generally framed as tomorrow’s problem. However, there are some hints that AI may already be taking ‘knowledge worker’ jobs,” commented J.P. Morgan’s chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli in a white paper. Microsoft just published a study entitled “Working with AI: Measuring the Applicability of Generative AI to Occupations,” which found that office and administrative support, business and financial operations, management, and sales-related jobs are among the top occupations most at risk of being replaced by AI. Retailers are top-loaded by all of those functions. Despite the popular belief that AI has yet to make a significant impact on the job market, Challenger, Gray and Christmas’ most recent report challenges that idea. It found that AI ranked third among the reasons for corporate job cuts in September, behind closures and market conditions. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon sees it accurately and while Walmart hasn’t announced any layoffs, it is holding the line on adding new staff. “It’s very clear that AI is going to change literally every job,” he said during a workforce conference with executives from other companies hosted at the company’s Bentonville headquarters and reported by Wall Street Journal. “Maybe there’s a job in the world that AI won’t change, but I haven’t thought of it.” Regrettably, some 32,000 employees of Amazon and Target are going to learn it the hard way.

Title: Watch this warning sign for when it's time to 'run for the hills' and sell AI stocks

BCA Research said it was looking for one warning sign in particular when it comes to the AI boom, which has sent tech stocks into stratospheric territory as companies pour billions into AI-related investments. According to Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at the research firm, it could be time for investors to get out when AI sees a "metaverse moment" — a scenario in which a large AI firm announces "even more capex" and sees its stock price drop, he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "If that were to happen, it would be time to run for the hills," Berezin said. "Until then, we are content to maintain only a slightly below-benchmark allocation to stocks on a 12-month horizon," he added. The metaverse embodied the market zeitgeist and drew billions in investment several years ago. The concept eventually faded out of popularity, causing firms like Meta to eventually report billions in losses. Some observers have drawn parallels to the AI craze, which has seen large tech firms pouring buckets into chips and data centers while monetization plans remain unclear. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four companies at the center of the AI trade — could spend as much as $320 billion on capex primarily related to AI infrastructure this year, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. Tech stocks have already flashed several warning signs recently, Berezin said. For one, the free cash flow of the so-called hyperscalers — large tech companies spending big on AI — has fallen in recent months, a possible sign that balance sheets at those companies are weaker. That was similar to what happened to telecom stocks prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Berezin said. Second, speculative stocks that have been buoyed by the AI trade have sold off in recent weeks. That's another worrying sign for the AI trade, Berezin added, pointing to the recent decline in quantum computing, rare earth, and nuclear energy stocks. Talk of a stock market bubble has grown on Wall Street as investors as investors take stock of enormous AI-fueled gains in recent years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is up 135% over the last five years. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven companies at the heart of the AI trade, is up 172% since its inception. Jump to

TWO MEN HAVE been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in scrubland in east Cork. A jury of ten men and two women found Luke Taylor (28) and Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan last week following a three-week trial at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Kieran Quilligan (47) was missing for five months when his remains were found in a ravine at Whitewell, Rostellan on 29 January 2024. He had suffered nineteen broken bones after being attacked with fists and a hammer-like object. Gardaí had brought a PSNI cadaver dog to an area of interest to the investigation in east Cork where they discovered the remains in a one tonne gravel bag. At a sentencing hearing in Cork today, Stephen Quilligan, father of the late Kieran Quilligan, said that the two perpetrators, whom he referred to as “monsters”, would never be forgiven for what they had done. Mr Quilligan said that he knew that there was foul play involved when his son disappeared without trace on 1 September 2023. “It all started for us two years ago and it has been a nightmare of our family ever since. We want to thank the gardaí who never gave up. They said they would bring Kieran home and they did,” he said. “Due to the nature of this case, any time we asked what was going on, the gardaí could not tell us. We were told when the case would come up in court, everything would come out. “We were hearing what really went on for the first time and were shocked, angry and in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened.” Mr Quilligan said that it was beyond difficult to listen to the “horror stories” that emerged over the course of the trial. He said that the defendants didn’t show “one bit of remorse” for murdering his son. He added that Kieran was a “loving son, brother and uncle” before thanking the gardaí and the prosecution team for treating Kieran “like a human being.” Catherine O’Flynn, the mother of Kieran Quilligan, said he was “adored” by his family. “Kieran had the biggest heart you ever seen. His birthday, 13 July 2023, was the last time I saw Kieran. If I had known what was going to happen I would never have left him leave the house,” she said. “I will never forgive them (Niall Long and Luke Taylor) for what they have put our family through.” Colette O’Driscoll, the partner of Kieran Quilligan, said that he left their home on 1 September 2023 and she never saw him again. Advertisement “Niall Long and Luke Taylor stole my future with the man I loved, adored and cherished.” She said that herself and Kieran were set to move in to their forever home when he was violently taken from this world. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long awaited castle. Now unfortunately Kieran will never get the keys to his castle.” Whilst sentencing Luke Taylor and Niall Long to mandatory life imprisonment, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford praised gardaí for the “exemplary” manner in which they carried out their comprehensive investigation. She said that the perpetrators might well have never been found other than for the enormous work of investigating gardaí. She also paid tribute to members of the Quilligan family for the manner in which they had conducted themselves in “difficult circumstances.” Ms Justice Lankford added that Kieran Quilligan was taken from this world in the “most egregious circumstances.” At the start of the sentencing hearing today, the coordinator of the Garda investigation, Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan of the Bridewell Garda Station in Cork, said that the two men subjected Kieran Quilligan to a “significant and sustained assault” on 1 September 2023. They then bundled him in to the boot of a car and brought him to a farmyard in Little Island. His body was then moved to the scrubland in Rostellan. She detailed the extensive harvesting of CCTV in the case which led gardaí to find the body of Kieran Quilligan and determine the identity of his killers. During the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, told the jury that the “instigating factor” for the murder was Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. Meanwhile, in the course of the trial the jurors heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem examination on the late Kieran Quilligan. Dr Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Kieran Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, leg and hand bones, jaw bones and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Father-of-two Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork, whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork. Kieran Quilligan was living with his partner in Simon Community housing in Cork city at the time of his death.

Title: Deutsche Digital Assets and Safello launch staked Bittensor ETP

German crypto and digital asset manager Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA) and Nordic cryptocurrency exchange Safello have announced the launch of the Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP. The launch comes as the crypto industry welcomes a growing number of digital asset-related products across the market, including the Bitcoin ETP by BlackRock. Meanwhile, Bittensor continues to attract attention as a top decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) project. Developments around AI, including from Big Tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta, have often pushed TAO and other AI tokens into the limelight. Frankfurt-based DDA, a pioneer in crypto exchange-traded products since 2017, announced the new product on October 29, 2025. The ETP is a collaboration with Safello and brings a physically backed Bittensor ETP to the expanding market. The product tracks the Kaiko Safello Staked Bittensor Index (KSSTAO) and is domiciled in Liechtenstein. Trading under ticker STAO (ISIN: DE000A4APQY4) on SIX is slated to commence to enhance seamless buying and selling during standard market hours. Moreover, the ETP is fully secured in cold storage by regulated custodian BitGo Europe GmbH and holds 100% physical TAO reserves. Investors are to benefit from total returns encompassing TAO’s price appreciation plus staking yields, automatically reinvested into the net asset value (NAV). With a competitive total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%, it provides an accumulating income structure, ideal for portfolio diversification amid rising interest in AI-driven blockchain assets. Maximilian Lautenschläger, CEO and founder of DDA, emphasized the strategic fit: “We are excited to announce the launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP through our collaboration with Safello. By leveraging DDA’s white-label ETP platform, we enable our partner to bring their innovative crypto investment strategies to market, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.” Bittensor (TAO) is currently trading at $425 and powers a groundbreaking peer-to-peer network, incentivizing collaborative machine learning. Participants contribute data, models, and compute power for tasks like image recognition, fraud detection, and protein structure prediction, earning TAO rewards in a proof-of-stake ecosystem. With a market cap exceeding $4.3 billion, Bittensor exemplifies the fusion of blockchain and AI, positioning it as a high-growth asset in the evolving digital economy. Safello CEO Emelie Moritz commented, “The launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP underlines Safello’s conviction in decentralised AI. Bittensor is a prime example of how decentralized technology and AI are converging to reshape the future of value creation. Together with DDA, we’re making it possible for investors to easily access this innovation through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle.” Bittensor price reached highs of $457 on Oct. 29, but its all-time high is $767, which it hit back in April 2024.

Title: Amazon just made deep job cuts. Its AI tools now need to prove it can do more with less.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hello! Wednesday is as good an excuse as any for a happy hour. But when it comes to Wall Street's favorite watering holes, does the Financial District's Stone Street still have the juice? BI's William Edwards went to find out. In today's big story, Amazon's massive layoffs are in full swing. Could it be the start of something bigger across corporate America? What's on deck: Markets: Mulling a move to Dubai? The good (tax-free status) and bad (traffic jams) of living and working in UAE's biggest city. Tech: The dark reality many female founders face when raising money from VCs. Business: Getting laid off stinks. Here's what to do if it happens to you. But first, cuts are coming. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. If the AI war on human jobs is really beginning, consider this the shot heard round corporate America. Amazon hasn't outright said AI will replace the 14,000 jobs it eliminated on Tuesday. But the technology is clearly playing a key role in its decision to make some of the deepest job cuts in its history. And when it comes to tech, where one big company goes, others soon follow. That's why this could be the beginning of a series of mass AI layoffs, BI's Aki Ito writes. Some Amazon leaders are calling out AI in their message to staff in the wake of the cuts. Tapas Roy, Amazon's vice president of device software and services, told employees in an internal memo to "lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness." Meanwhile, Bob Carrigan, the CEO of Audible, didn't outright mention AI in a Tuesday email, but said there will be changes to "increase the speed of decision-making." And the pain might not be over at Amazon. Tuesday's layoffs mostly impacted early and mid-level managers in the retail division, according to internal data obtained by BI's Eugene Kim. But some fear AWS, which saw less than 1% of its staff affected, could be a target early next year. Amazon's job cuts could be a giant proof of concept for the new business it's betting on. Like everyone else in the AI race, one of Amazon's top priorities is proving its AI tools are worth the price of admission. That hasn't always been easy, as is evident by Amazon's Q Developer struggles. Talking about how great your tools are only gets you so far, though. When the owner of a bulletproof vest company wanted to sell his product, he strapped it on and shot himself in the chest multiple times. So what better way to advertise the benefits Amazon's AI tools can bring customers than starting with itself? Our tools are so efficient that we cut 14,000 people and didn't miss a beat. It's a massive risk, as failure would disrupt Amazon's business at a critical juncture and call into question the value of its AI products. But with so much on the line, and its back somewhat against the wall, Amazon might not have another choice. What it's like to work and live in Dubai. Migration to the expat-filled city is cementing the UAE's status as an international business center. BI's Bradley Saacks recently visited Dubai and spoke with those who have made the move to understand what life is like in the Gulf. The tax-free status and warm weather are nice perks, too. The (rate cut) show must go on. The ongoing government shutdown means there was no September jobs report, but the Fed is still expected to cut rates this week even without that missing data. Consumers could start to feel relief from lower mortgage and credit-card borrowing costs. How Goldman Sachs' managing directors get made. Goldman is expected to promote about 600 people — or 1% of staff — to the rank of MD. BI's Reed Alexander went behind the scenes for a glimpse of the secretive promotion process. The hidden cost of fundraising as a female founder. Venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig surveyed 180 women founders about building their startups. Though she didn't ask about sexual harassment on the job, they told her anyway. Female founders say it's still common while seeking venture capital, and two of them shared with BI what they experienced. The evolution of Elon Musk's pay package pitch. It's not the first time Tesla's board has asked shareholders to back a package. For Musk's latest $1 trillion pitch, Tesla is taking a more direct approach, explicitly addressing the fear of losing him as CEO. The top people in Mustafa Suleyman's circle. The CEO of Microsoft's AI division has added nine direct reports, five of whom previously worked at Google or DeepMind, according to organization charts viewed by BI. Suleyman's team is focused on Microsoft's consumer AI strategy, like Copilot and Bing. Here's a breakdown of team changes. Experiencing a package holdup?

Nvidia has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the Silicon Valley chipmaker was first to break through the $4 trillion barrier. Hitting the new benchmark puts more emphasis on the upheaval being unleashed by an artificial intelligence craze that’s widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone’s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. But there are concerns of a possible AI bubble, with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month flagging the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The head of the International Monetary Fund has raised a similar alarm. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia’s chips is the main reason that the company’s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023. On Wednesday the shares touched $207.86 in early morning trading with 24.3 billion shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $5.05 trillion. In comparison, Nvidia’s value is greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nvidia carved out an early lead in tailoring its chipsets known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, from use in powering video games to helping to train powerful AI systems, like the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators. Demand skyrocketed as more people began using AI chatbots. Tech companies scrambled for more chips to build and run them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns of a bubble bursting, saying that the generative AI chatbots that were merely “interesting” when they first took hold a few years ago are now becoming so useful that they will be profitable. Huang was heading to South Korea this week as leaders from major Pacific Rim economies, including the United States, China and Japan, are gathering for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that has long championed free trade but is now confronting sweeping U.S. tariffs on technology and other products. The multilateral gathering in Gyeongju is expected to be overshadowed by a sideline event — a face-to-face meeting on Thursday between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping — as their intensifying trade war leaves the South Korean hosts in a difficult balancing act. On Tuesday, Huang disclosed $500 billion in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $1 billion investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology. In addition, Nvidia is teaming with the Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers. Last month Nvidia announced that it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centers to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. In August, Huang said that Nvidia was discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. Trump said on Air Force One that he will speak with Xi about Nvidia’s chips on Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC event that Huang is also attending. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion.

Title: Nvidia Just Became the First $5 Trillion Company—Monitor These Crucial Stock Price Levels

Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company to ever achieve a market capitalization of $5 trillion as its stock surged in early trading Wednesday. Shares were up 4.5% at $210 recently, after gaining 5% yesterday following a keynote address from CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's developers conference in Washington, D.C. where he highlighted the companyt's latest AI products and announced several deals. The chipmaker unveiled a $1 billion investment in Nokia (NOK), as well as a new strategic partnership with the Finnish tech firm in an effort to expand its AI infrastructure push. Nvidia also announced that it will collaborate with Oracle (ORCL) to build AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and collaborate with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) on the development of an integrated AI technology stack. Nvidia shares have gained more than 50% since the start of the year as investors have piled into the stock amid strong demand for AI chips and optimism about the company’s ongoing growth prospects. The company's $5 trillion market cap is substantially higher than the next companies on the list of the world's most valuable—Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) have market caps around $4 trillion. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify crucial price levels to monitor. Nvidia shares broke out from a rising wedge on Tuesday on the highest trading volume since late May, signaling buying conviction behind the move. Although chart watchers often associate this pattern as bearish, it can also indicate a bullish continuation rather than a reversal if it forms during a strong uptrend, as is the case on Nvidia’s chart. Meanwhile, yesterday’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index approaching overbought levels, though the indicator sits below its July peak, giving the stock further room to move into price discovery mode. Let’s use technical analysis to project a potential upside target on Nvidia’s chart and also identify two crucial support levels worth watching. Investors can project a potential upside target by using the measured move technique, a trading tool that analyzes well-known chart patterns to forecast future price movements. When applying the analysis to the chipmaker’s chart, we measure the distance between the rising wedge’s two upward sloping trendlines near their widest section and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. This projects a target of $220 ($25 + $195), indicating the price could climb to around this level before encountering potential resistance and entering a period of consolidation. The first support level to watch sits around $185. This area could attract buying interest near a range of corresponding price action on the chart stretching back to the start of the rising wedge pattern in early August. Finally, a deeper retracement could see Nvidia shares test lower support at the $165 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a trendline connecting last month’s low with the end of a brief pullback in late July.

Title: Nvidia Hits $5T Market Cap as Bitcoin Now Trails U.S. Equities Year to Date

The Nvidia (NVDA)-led rally in stocks this month has now pushed the returns of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq above that of bitcoin BTC$109,695.47. With additional gains on Tuesday while bitcoin dipped, the S&P 500's 17% rise year-to-date is ahead of BTC's 16% advance. The Nasdaq has widened its lead over bitcoin, now higher by 24%. Gold continues to be the top-performing major asset class with a 50% rise. No rally in U.S. stocks can be talked about with mentioning the Mag 7 names, and specifically within that group Nvidia (NVDA). Shares are up 17% over the past five days amid a continuing barrage of AI-related partnership deals, pushing the company's market cap above $5 trillion early Wednesday. Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (APPL) remain just behind NVIDIA, each valued at around a $4 trillion market cap. According to the X account Hedgie Markets, NVIDIA is responsible for nearly 20% of the S&P 500's gains this year and now accounts for 8.3% of the index's total weighting. To put Nvidia's size in perspective, the company's market cap is now larger than the combined values of AMD, Arm Holdings, ASML, Broadcom, Intel, Lam Research, Micron, Qualcomm, and Taiwan Semi, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Nvidia's growth has coincided with the huge developments in artificial intelligence. On Tuesday alone, the company announced a series of new partnerships with Palantir (PLTR) and Samsung, a $1 billion investment in Nokia, and a potential collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy to build new supercomputers. It's more of the same in opening action on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq higher by 0.5%, Nvidia up 4.6% and bitcoin slipping back under $113,000, roughly 10% below its record high.

Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut today, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%–4.00%. This decision is nearly a done deal as the Fed navigates uncertainties from a weakening labor market and ongoing federal government shutdown that limits economic data. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to announce the decision at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The Fed is likely to remain cautious in its guidance, keeping future rate moves open, as officials are divided on the pace of cuts. There may be some dissent with at least one official favoring a larger cut of 50 basis points.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia just became the world’s first $5 trillion company. Unprecedented demand for the company’s AI chips has propelled the company’s market valuation into the stratosphere. The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday’s open, comes just three months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation. The company’s shares (NVDA) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has gained about 50% in 2025 and has been near or at the top of the S&P 500’s best-performing stocks for years as investment in artificial intelligence continues to fuel the chipmaker’s meteoric rise. Boosting Nvidia’s stock Wednesday: hopes for discussions between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that open up China’s market to Nvidia’s high-end AI chips. On Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock rose after CEO Jensen Huang presented a vision of Nvidia’s future in which the company’s chips would be placed in everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars. Huang, in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington on Tuesday was effusive in his praise for Trump. Nvidia’s AI chips are essential to powering the data centers that run the technology. The company is central to the AI boom not just because of those chips that are making it tons of money, but also because of the investments it’s pouring into other major players. On Tuesday, another tech giant — Apple — breached the $4 trillion benchmark. It’s a sign that that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company has fallen behind in the AI race. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AI leader OpenAI recently announced a major new tie-up, which will have the ChatGPT maker purchase billions of dollars’ worth of chips in exchange for a $100 billion investment from Nvidia that will be made over time. Nvidia also announced a $5 billion investment in beleaguered chipmaker Intel. Apple is now worth $4,000,000,000,000 But the circular spending spree, paired with the industry’s eye-popping growth rates and the lack of clarity around the return on AI investments, has raised concerns that the AI market may be a bubble waiting to burst. Still, Nvidia executives said during the company’s August earnings call that it estimates it will benefit from as much as $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia raked in nearly $26 billion in net income. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Paschal Sheehy Southern Editor Two men have been jailed for life for the murder of another man whose skeletal remains were found in a gravel bag in a ravine in east Cork, five months after he went missing. A jury at the Central Criminal Court in Cork had been told Kieran Quilligan was lured to a laneway near Cork city centre before he was ambushed and beaten to death. Mr Quilligan was 47 years of age and was originally from Togher in Cork city. He went missing from St Finbarr's Place in Cork on the evening of 1 September 2023. Prosecuting Senior Counsel Donal O'Sullivan told the Central Criminal Court jury he had been lured to the laneway before he was ambushed. The State's case was that 28-year-old Luke Taylor, originally from Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, in Cork, was the one who lured Mr Quilligan to the laneway. Mr Quilligan was alleged to have stolen drugs and cash from a second man earlier in the day, 33-year-old Niall Long, originally from St Michael's Close in Mahon in Cork. Niall Long, it was alleged, ambushed him before he was beaten to death in retaliation for the earlier robbery. Both men were convicted of Mr Quilligan's murder by a jury last week. Their trial was told that gardaí undertook extensive searches for Mr Quilligan in east Cork, after CCTV tracked them travelling there immediately after he disappeared. His skeletal remains were found five months later by a cadaver dog, as part of a garda search. A post-mortem examination was unable to identify a cause of death for Mr Quilligan. But pathologist Dr Margot Bolster established he had been attacked with a weapon like a hammer and suffered fractures to his skull, neck and jaw, his hand, his leg, his chest and his ribs.

"The anger and frustration was unbearable for our family," he said. "We want to thank the gardai who never gave up. They told us they would bring Kieran home and they did. "Kieran was a loving son, brother and uncle. He is sadly missed by all of us and our lives will never be the same without him." Mr Quilligan's mother, Catherine O'Flynn, said he was missed, loved and adored. "If my love could have saved you, you would still be here with us," she said. "Our hearts were broken in a million pieces - our worst nightmare come true." In her victim impact statement, Mr Quilligan's long-term partner, Colette O'Driscoll, described how they had been given the good news that they were to be housed together a short time before he disappeared. "I have a heavy heart. I miss my best friend every day. I feel lonely without him," she said. Sentencing both men to life in prison, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford said Mr Quilligan's life had been taken in most egregious circumstances. She described the garda investigation as exemplary, and said Niall Long and Luke Taylor might never have been identified were it not for the huge volume of work on the case carried out by detectives. Both men indicated to the court through their counsel that they intend to appeal. Southern Editor © RTÉ 2025.

Title: The Evolution of Capitalism: Why Markets Defy Feudal Aristocracy

In 2005, Citigroup analysts coined the term Plutonomy as an ideological provocation disguised as analysis. They argued that global growth rested disproportionately on the spending of the wealthy, especially the “top 1%.” According to this claim, the world economy follows the whims of the global elites’ demand, while the majority slips into irrelevance. The Plutonomy thesis reveals either ignorance of capitalism or ideological hostility toward it. Left-collectivist critics embrace it because it dresses capitalism as feudalism in modern clothes. But in essence, capitalism and feudalism are opposites. Feudalism chains wealth and power to the bloodline, preserving a static order. Capitalism breaks that order. It multiplies, redistributes and even annihilates wealth through innovation, entrepreneurship and competition. Plutonomy advocates point to inequality data to support their case. Yes, wealth concentration exists, but the inference those advocates draw from it is false. Capitalism’s logic is not one of privilege but freedom. Studies from Williams Group wealth consultancy show that two-thirds of wealthy families lose their fortune by the second generation, and 90% by the third. Concentration of wealth is not permanent but a phase in a cycle. The system does not malfunction when wealth clusters — it functions. Success receives reward, but failure swiftly destroys fortunes. The capitalist system rests on voluntary exchange, individual initiative and open competition. The moral principle is not “the few rule the many” but “each individual acts by right.” Critics mistake correlation for causation. Rising wealth at the top does not mean exclusion of the bottom. In fact, global data since 1980 demonstrates that while the top 1% grew richer, more than a billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty. China, India and much of Southeast Asia did not escape starvation because elites consumed more; they escaped because capitalism’s logic of production and trade reached their masses. The logic of capitalism undermines Plutonomy at its root. Elites may shape markets, but capitalism’s engine lies in mass participation. The wealthy do not dictate growth; they compete within a framework shaped by consumer sovereignty and entrepreneurial risk. No aristocracy ever built an industrial revolution; no plutocracy ever lifted billions from poverty. Only capitalism, driven by free exchange and broad demand, accomplished that. Capitalism treats wealth as a process, not a possession. Entrepreneurs must continually recreate wealth through production, innovation and risk-taking. Inherited fortunes erode when heirs fail to compete. Thomas Piketty claimed that capital tends to accumulate, but capitalist markets demonstrate the opposite: Unused capital dissipates. This competitive order forces every firm and every individual to justify their position anew. Aristocracy freezes history in bloodlines while capitalism accelerates history through challenge, destruction and renewal. Joseph Schumpeter identified this dynamic as creative destruction. He argued that capitalism thrives by overturning the old and replacing it with the new. Innosight data confirms this: In the 1950s, Fortune 500 companies survived on average for 60 years. Today, they survive for less than 20 years. Kodak dominated photography with 90% of the film market, yet it collapsed in 2012 because it ignored digital innovation. Canon, Sony and other firms seized Kodak’s market by betting on digital technologies. Nokia controlled 40% of the cellphone market in 1999, but its share fell below 5% by 2013 because it missed the smartphone revolution. Apple and Samsung seized Nokia’s throne. In 1980, oil and auto companies such as Exxon, GM and Ford dominated the global rankings. By 2022, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla occupied those top positions. The World Economic Forum estimates that industries younger than 40 years generate over half of global GDP. Shifts in dominance reveal capitalism’s law: Innovators survive, complacent firms vanish. Entrepreneurial stories embody the same laws. American businessman Jeff Bezos launched Amazon in a garage in 1994 and expanded it into a trillion-dollar firm by leveraging capitalism’s infrastructure of financial markets and contract law. South African businessman Elon Musk reinvested profits from PayPal into Tesla and SpaceX, enterprises that toppled century-old automakers and state-run aerospace monopolies. American businessman Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in a dormitory and redefined global communication. These entrepreneurs did not inherit aristocratic dynasties. They acted. Forbes reports that more than 70% of billionaires worldwide are self-made, and in China, over 80% built their fortunes as first-generation entrepreneurs. Capitalism rewards action, not birth. This dynamic reality delivers capitalism’s strongest refutation of aristocracy and Plutonomy. Aristocracy assumes permanence; capitalism enforces transience. Aristocracy passes property by bloodline; capitalism demands innovation by merit. Plutonomy imagines static classes; capitalism generates continual upheaval. In 19th-century American business life, the rise of the “inventor-businessman” type most clearly revealed capitalism’s difference from aristocracy. Andrew Carnegie, a poor immigrant from Scotland, rose to become one of the giants of the steel industry. John D. Rockefeller, starting from humble origins, founded Standard Oil and became the world’s first dollar billionaire. Rockefeller was born in 1839 in New York to a poor family. His father, William Avery Rockefeller, worked as a charlatan traveling salesman, always chasing ventures and failing to provide a steady income. His mother lived frugally and devotedly. Rockefeller grew up amidst poverty and uncertainty but absorbed discipline and thrift early on. At 16, he began working in an accounting firm. In his first years of work, he carefully tracked every dollar, saving some and donating some to charity. By his early twenties, he entered the oil business in Cleveland with his partners. At the time, oil was new and difficult to refine, yet Rockefeller turned these difficulties into advantages. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in 1863 and quickly built it into the largest US oil company in refining, distribution and sales. He also tried to monopolize transportation by striking deals with railroad companies to gain cost advantages. This advantage lasted only until the state enacted antitrust laws. In 1911, the US Supreme Court declared Standard Oil a monopoly and ordered its breakup. Far from shrinking Rockefeller’s fortune, this ruling multiplied it, as the separated companies — Exxon, Chevron and Mobil — grew independently. The episode revealed a truth of the capitalist market: Even a monopoly, once broken, can generate more growth in a dynamic marketplace. Rockefeller also pioneered what we now call philanthropic capitalism. He donated hundreds of millions to institutions such as Harvard and the University of Chicago. The foundations he created in medicine and education still shape society today. He did not owe his wealth to the state, as state regulations tried to restrict him. He did not inherit aristocratic privilege, nor did he cling to feudal instincts of passing wealth intact to heirs. Instead, he taught his children thrift, philanthropy and entrepreneurship. Through his story, capitalism reveals its revolutionary and egalitarian nature: The son of a poor preacher left a permanent mark on world history through ability and hard work in the marketplace. The Rothschild family illustrates how intellect, numerical skill and entrepreneurship built a global banking network despite European antisemitism. Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 in the Frankfurt ghetto, where Jews lived under restriction with scarce educational opportunities. Mayer displayed an extraordinary passion for books and numbers. As a youth, he apprenticed with a banker in Frankfurt, learning financial calculations. He then traded antiques and rare coins, building his first capital. This step gave him access to Frankfurt’s nobility. In the 1760s, Mayer achieved his breakthrough when he became financial advisor to Wilhelm IX, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel (a state within the Holy Roman Empire). He managed the prince’s wealth but showed greater genius by sending four of his five sons — Nathan Mayer, Saloman Mayer, Karl Mayer and James Mayer — to Europe’s capitals to establish a family banking network. Nathan went to London, Salomon to Vienna, Karl to Naples and James to Paris. The Rothschilds became the most influential financial family of 19th-century Europe. Their success came from superior knowledge, communication and risk management. Before the telegraph, they created networks that gave them faster access to market information. During the Napoleonic Wars, they controlled key information flows, lent money to Britain and helped finance the British army against France. The Rothschilds did not descend from a dynasty. They exemplified how a marginalized Jewish family could, despite prohibitions, become leaders in finance by investing in knowledge and commerce. The capitalist market valued their achievement, not their lineage. And although their descendants remain financially active, modern giants like BlackRock and Vanguard far surpass the influence the Rothschilds held a century ago. Their eclipse proves again that capitalism does not freeze into aristocracy but renews itself endlessly. Capitalism’s competitive nature creates a powerful resistance mechanism against the absolutization of economic power. Competition functions not as an external safeguard but as the system’s internal law, its self-regulating force. Those who claim that capitalists inevitably form cartels to seize markets misunderstand the essence of capitalism. Oligopolies may rise, and firms may dominate for a time, but such power cannot last. Knowledge flows, entrepreneurship pushes forward and innovation breaks every chain. The marketplace acts as a battlefield in which permanence is an illusion. What matters is the ability to adapt, not the possession of a temporary advantage. In the late 1980s, Microsoft commanded almost absolute dominance in global software with its Windows operating system and Office suite, which ran on over 80% of personal computers. Yet, this supremacy did not endure. Google rose by capturing the internet, Apple transformed communication through the iPhone and Linux opened doors for free software alternatives. Today, Microsoft remains powerful, yet it no longer controls the future of computing. The automobile industry reveals the same dynamic. For decades, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler ruled the US market. But Japanese firms —Toyota, Honda, Nissan — challenged them with efficient production and durable models. By the 1980s, Japanese automakers controlled nearly 30% of the US market, forcing Detroit into reform or collapse. In this century, Tesla has shattered the industry again, proving that even the giants of capitalism cannot insulate themselves from new rivals armed with better ideas. This fragility does not weaken capitalism; it strengthens it. Dynamism, not stagnation, defines its law. The rise of the East Asian Tigers — South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong — illustrates capitalism’s transformative power. In 1960, South Korea’s GDP per capita barely reached $150; by 2020, it had risen to over $30,000. Taiwan, once an agrarian economy, became a global technology leader and now produces more than 54% of the world’s semiconductors through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Singapore, a city-state without natural resources, climbed to rank among the wealthiest nations, with a GDP per capita surpassing $70,000. These countries escaped poverty not by state planning but by unleashing markets, encouraging exports, fostering education and creating an open environment for enterprise. Centrally planned economies show the opposite trajectory. The Soviet Union, despite immense resources, collapsed under inefficiency. Former supreme leader Mao Zedong’s China starved tens of millions. Only when Mao’s successor Deng Xiaoping’s reforms embraced markets in 1978 did China’s GDP begin to grow at an average of nearly 10% per year for three decades, lifting 800 million people out of extreme poverty. The real enemy of competition is not capitalism but the state. History shows that whenever governments step in to control markets, competition collapses. In the 17th century, the British Crown granted the East India Company exclusive rights to trade in Asia. Instead of innovation, this monopoly produced corruption, inefficiency and exploitation, until its collapse in the 19th century. In the 20th century, state-backed corporations in Latin America — such as Pemex in Mexico or Petrobras in Brazil — became centers of inefficiency and political patronage, draining resources without innovation. The United States itself has suffered similar distortions: The government’s antitrust case against AT&T in the 1980s reveals how state-protected dominance stalled telecommunications innovation. Once AT&T was broken up, competition flourished, giving rise to mobile telephony, the internet and the digital revolution. In the second half of the 20th century, South Korea and Taiwan embraced export-led capitalism, transforming from impoverished to high-income economies. Between 1960 and 1990, South Korea’s GDP per capita grew nearly tenfold. By contrast, North Korea, under state control, stagnated in famine and isolation. The same divide appeared in Germany: West Germany’s market economy surged after 1948, while East Germany’s socialist experiment collapsed under inefficiency and repression. Latin America shows the same truth. Venezuela — with the world’s largest proven oil reserves — nationalized industries and imposed state control. By 2020, its GDP had contracted by over 70% from the previous decade, inflation exceeded one million percent and millions fled the country in response to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, Chile liberalized markets in the 1970s and 80s. From 1990 to 2015, its poverty rate fell from 40% to under 10%, and it became Latin America’s richest nation per capita. In China, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) consume over 30% of the country’s bank credit yet generate less than 10% of GDP growth. World Bank data shows SOEs earn returns on assets less than half those of private firms. They survive on subsidies, cheap credit and political protection. By contrast, private firms — Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and BYD — compete globally and drive breakthroughs in telecom, digital finance and electric vehicles. The difference lies in rules: SOEs live by privilege, private firms by competition. SOEs employ barely 10% of China’s workforce yet capture most corporate credit, starving small firms of capital. Productivity lags because connected giants hoard resources. Meanwhile, the private sector — responsible for 80% of urban jobs and 70% of innovation — faces crackdowns whenever it threatens state power. The West tells the story in another form. The 2008 financial crisis showed how intervention entrenches failure. US and European governments bailed out American International Group (AIG), Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and others, freezing competition and rewarding recklessness. The US Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) spent $700 billion rescuing failing banks, while the Eurozone added trillions in guarantees. Instead of disciplining error, states preserved it. These bailouts created a sense of moral hazard. Banks knew governments would shield them, so accountability vanished. A decade of ultra-low rates followed, keeping “zombie companies” alive. This was not a result of capitalism failing, but capitalism blocked. The corrective force of failure capitalism provides, was replaced by political privilege. Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand foresaw it: “The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is only a matter of time.” When governments protect the incompetent, they turn markets from arenas of merit into shelters of privilege. The market demands discipline. Remove that truth, and freedom vanishes. State-backed oligopolies, rent-seeking firms and politically privileged corporations represent the intrusion of non-capitalist elements into the system. Rand captured this with brutal clarity in her novel Atlas Shrugged: When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion — when you see that in order to produce, you need permission from men who produce nothing — when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors … you may know that your society is doomed. Her warning underscores the point: government favoritism replaces merit with power and enterprise with privilege. A genuine free market grants no actor permanent advantage. Every success must be tested, every fortune re-earned, every firm challenged. Collectivist regimes historically reveal the true nature of plutonomy. The Soviet Union gave Politburo elites privileges comparable to those of Western billionaires, while ordinary people could not access basic goods. In China, Mao’s Cultural Revolution impoverished millions, while Party cadres enjoyed privileged lives. During Deng’s reforms, the state integrated market elements but ensured that real capital accumulation still depended on Party ties. In contemporary China, the case of business magnate and investor Jack Ma illustrates this reality: after criticizing government policies, he lost public visibility, and the state restructured Alibaba (a multinational technology company), demonstrating how easily political authority can dismantle market success. The case of Venezuela illustrates the modern socialist version of plutonomy. Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez built his 21st-century socialism not by distributing oil revenues to the people but by concentrating them within the state apparatus and a loyal elite. Managers of Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) enriched themselves rapidly in foreign currency, while the general population lacked access to basic food and medicine. These cases prove that plutonomy emerges not in capitalism but in collectivism. Capitalism’s stability and sustainability depend on a broad consumer base that responds to production. Economic growth and prosperity come not from the excessive wealth of the minority but from the consumption capacity of the majority. The capitalist market functions as a democratic decision-making arena. Consumers, through their daily purchasing choices, effectively cast votes in the marketplace. These votes reflect not only economic value but also preference. The market thus becomes a ballot box where products and services, not rulers, compete. Consumer behavior directly shapes economic existence. The consumer acts as capitalism’s “silent voter” — silent because the vote is cast by buying, not speaking. Yet this silence masks immense power: the collective choices of consumers decide whether a product stays on shelves, spreads or vanishes. Unlike centrally planned systems, capitalism rests on pluralism and bottom-up consent. Liberal democratic philosophy aligns with this capitalist structure. Just as political leaders rise through popular votes, entrepreneurs and producers survive only through consumer choice. No matter their capital, ventures without customers collapse. This reality highlights capitalism’s populist and majoritarian nature, not an aristocratic one. Capitalism is no elitist club but a competitive arena built on mass consent. For a product to remain in the market, it must resonate with the public. This constant need for validation keeps capitalism open to pressures from below. Broad participation is the indispensable condition of capitalist democracy. If middle- and lower-income groups cannot participate, the voting mechanism breaks down. Capitalism requires individuals not just to exist as consumers but to function effectively as consumers. The democratic nature of the market creates fairness and dynamism. Consumer choice directs supply, drives innovation, raises efficiency and prevents waste. Each purchase acts as a “yes” vote; each rejection, a “no” vote. This continuous micro-level voting process builds a coordination mechanism more precise and dynamic than any central planner could achieve. The market generates a natural order through supply and demand. Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek described this as spontaneous order, where knowledge spreads through millions of free decisions, not through central authority. No ministry or planning agency can collect and process such knowledge. French diplomat, political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville highlights a fundamental tension in Democracy in America: In democratic societies, when freedom is sacrificed to equality, people become passive and consent to their own chains. The plutonomy discourse offers exactly such chains: it promises not freedom but passivity under the guise of equality. Capitalism rests on the moral principle of consent. Neither producer nor consumer, neither employer nor employee, enters the system by force. This order, built on mutual benefit, secures not only economic efficiency but also individual autonomy. Capitalist economics allow the individual to secure their place through labor, capital or ideas. In contrast, plutonomy undermines freedom by persuading individuals to believe in systemic determinism rather than their own potential. This mentality denies individual worth and responsibility, portraying success not as the product of productivity but as a matter of birth privilege. As a result, young individuals turn away from entrepreneurship, and potential inventors give way to “pseudo-opponents” who hate the system yet make no contribution.

Title: Will Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin In 2026?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/will-ethereum-outperform-bitcoin-in-2026/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:14:08Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Ethereum’s impressive 120% rise over the past six months, reaching approximately $4,000, has significantly eclipsed Bitcoin’s modest 20% increase during this timeframe. This isn’t merely a fleeting moment—various fundamental factors indicate that ETH might sustain its outperformance trajectory.​ Before we explore the specifics, if you’re interested in an upside with less volatility compared to holding a single stock or token like ETH or BTC, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has thoroughly outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices—and has secured returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Investing in a single stock or token without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. Why is this the situation? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive approach to maximize gains during optimistic market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Ethereum’s superior performance indicates genuine fundamental advantages: the adoption of institutional ETFs, upcoming technical enhancements, deflationary tokenomics, and its foundational role in the expanding DeFi ecosystem. The December Fusaka upgrade and ongoing institutional accumulation imply that this trend might continue well into 2026.​ Nevertheless, investors need to balance ETH’s higher reward potential with its elevated volatility and technical complexity.

Title: Did You Miss Broadcom Stock’s $51 Billion Payout?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/did-you-miss-broadcom-stocks-51-billion-payout/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:07:05Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has delivered a significant $51 billion back to its shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. This extraordinary cash generation stems from Broadcom's position as a dominant supplier of mission-critical semiconductor chips and infrastructure software, where the company operates in markets with exceptionally high barriers to entry and generates industry-leading margins that convert revenue into pure cash flow. Broadcom’s cash machine operates on two highly profitable pillars: its semiconductor solutions business that generates $34 billion (LTM) with products so essential to data center, networking, and mobile infrastructure, and its infrastructure software division producing $26 billion through mission-critical enterprise software, including VMware's virtualization platform that customers rely on for their core operations. The company’s business model is particularly cash-generative because it focuses on high-margin, recurring revenue streams, allowing Broadcom to convert approximately $24+ billion annually into free cash flow from its $51.6 billion revenue base. Let's examine some statistics and see how this cash return capability compares to the largest capital-return companies in the market. Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd highest for total returns to shareholders in history. Why should this matter to you? Because dividends and stock buybacks provide direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s fiscal health and capability to generate sustainable cash inflows. Additionally, there are numerous other stocks like this. Here’s a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. For comprehensive rankings, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The total amount of capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth expectations for reinvestment opportunities. Companies like Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are experiencing significantly faster growth, more predictably when compared to their counterparts, but have returned a much smaller proportion of their market cap to shareholders. This represents the downside of high capital returns. Certainly, they are appealing, but you need to ask yourself: Am I compromising on growth and solid fundamentals? Keeping this in mind, let’s review some data for AVGO. (Refer to Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for more insight) That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. That said, AVGO is not immune to significant downturns. It experienced a nearly 48% drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, around 35% during the 2021 inflation shock, and approximately 27% during the 2018 correction. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Go – for more details. Even with robust fundamentals, it is evident that the stock can undergo substantial declines when market conditions change. Quality companies still suffer when market sentiment shifts abruptly. However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider circumstances like earnings reports, business announcements, and changes in forecasts. Check AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines historically. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Circle Launches Arc Testnet With BlackRock, Visa, and AWS — A New Era for Stablecoin Infrastructure
URL: https://beincrypto.com/circle-launches-arc-testnet/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:05:46Z
Full Content:
Written byPaul Kim Edited byOihyun Kim Circle, the issuer of USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has unveiled the public testnet for its proprietary Layer 1 blockchain network, ‘Arc.’ The ambitious project has garnered significant backing, with over 100 global firms participating, including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Coinbase. Circle announced the launch of the Arc testnet via a press release on Monday. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the network’s mission: “Arc provides an opportunity for all companies to build services atop enterprise-grade network infrastructure.” He stressed that the platform is designed to implement an “open, inclusive, and efficient global economic system on the internet.” Circle released Arc as its recently introduced native blockchain. USDC traditionally relies on public chains like Ethereum for transactions. However, these networks often create high, volatile fees and unpredictable costs, which Arc aims to resolve. Arc is unique because it utilizes USDC, the US dollar-pegged stablecoin, as its native gas token. This design offers predictable fees and an economically efficient cost structure. Circle plans for Arc to provide blockchain infrastructure that meets the stringent requirements of the financial sector, which existing public chains have struggled to satisfy. The Arc testnet allows experimentation with new functions in a secure environment using test assets. The system supports various financial applications, including lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. To achieve this, it seamlessly integrates with Circle’s existing stablecoin platform. Regional stablecoin issuers from Japan (JPYC), Brazil (BRLA), and Canada (QCAD) are currently participating in the testnet, with plans to expand to dollar- and euro-based issuers. The testnet launch has attracted broad institutional participation. Major Wall Street firms are involved in the project, including BNY Mellon, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), State Street, BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Standard Chartered (SC). Technology and payment giants like AWS, Mastercard, and Visa have joined, and leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are participating. Circle stated its long-term plan is to transition the development of Arc to a decentralized governance system, expanding validator participation to establish a community-centric operational structure. As stablecoin issuers pursue control over settlement infrastructure, Circle is not alone in building its own Layer-1 blockchain while issuing stablecoins. Companies like Tether (with Stable) and Stripe (with Tempo) are following similar paths, seeking to escape dependence on external networks like Ethereum or Tron. By owning their base layer, these firms can directly embed compliance features, control transaction costs, and ensure predictable performance without competing for blockspace with unrelated activities. For instance, Tether shapes the ambitions of blockchain through Stable. The company raised $28 million in seed funding to build a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain optimized for USDT transactions. The economics make this strategy particularly compelling for large issuers. Revenue from owning the settlement layer could far exceed traditional payment processing margins. Additionally, custom chains allow implementation of KYC checks at the protocol level and enable companies to issue their own gas tokens, creating new revenue streams while reducing operational dependencies. Technical optimization provides significant advantages for stablecoin-specific use cases. General-purpose blockchains prioritize programmability and composability, not the low-fee, high-throughput requirements of payment systems. Purpose-built chains like Stable can offer sub-second block times, parallel execution, and guaranteed finality—features essential for real-world payments and remittances that mainstream adoption demands.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia became the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization at the open on Wednesday morning. The tech giant's stock was up around 4.4% to almost $210 in the opening minutes of trading, giving it a valuation of roughly $5.1 trillion. The historic valuation milestone was reached after CEO Jensen Huang said Tuesday that the company expects $500 billion in AI chip orders over the next four years and plans to build seven AI supercomputers for the US Department of Energy. Nvidia's upward move was also bolstered by President Donald Trump saying in a Wednesday press conference in South Korea that he could discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chips with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a meeting on Thursday. Nvidia also gained after a Tuesday announcement that it would invest $1 billion in Nokia to develop 6G technology. That news pushed the Finnish telecommunications' stock up to its highest level in almost a decade. The chip firm's stock has risen more than 50% so far in 2025 and has climbed a staggering 1,500% in the past five years. Nvidia's arrival at a $5 trillion valuation comes just a day after Apple hit a $4 trillion market capitalization, joining Microsoft and Nvidia in the exclusive club. Apple hit $4 trillion for the first time as the company's rally, driven by strong iPhone 17 sales, continued. Apple's share price was virtually unchanged at $269.68 at the open on Wednesday. "The Q3 earnings season will reach its apex this week with key reports due from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta on Wednesday as well as Apple and Amazon on Thursday," Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Monday. "The five biggest companies in the world after Nvidia now make up $15tn in total market capitalization or 25% of the S&P 500." Jump to

Today’s top news: The world’s biggest money transfer company is going on-chain. And it didn’t pick Ethereum or Bitcoin. 📌 What Happened Western Union, the 173-year-old global money transfer giant, just announced it’s launching a stablecoin on Solana. Western Union will issue a U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDPT, built on Solana, with custody provided by Anchorage Digital. The rollout begins in 2026, targeting hundreds of millions of users across LatAm, Africa, and Southeast Asia, regions where stablecoins already dominate real economic usage. The stablecoin will plug straight into Western Union’s existing licensed fiat rails and 4,500+ corridors, enabling people to move dollars across borders without banks, ACH delays, or predatory FX fees. And here’s the curveball: Western Union says it plans to keep supporting cash-in and cash-out locations, effectively becoming a global on/off ramp for Solana. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “For 175 years, we’ve been connecting people, moving $150 billion a year. Digital assets is the next evolution. We looked at alternatives, and came to the conclusion that Solana was the right choice.” - Devin McGranahan, CEO of Western Union Why is Western Union launching a stablecoin on Solana? > Here's what Devin McGranahan, CEO of Western Union, said 👇 "For 175 years, we've been connecting people, moving $150 billion a year. Digital assets is the next evolution. We looked at alternatives, and came to the… pic.twitter.com/zmLGFUmJLp — Mango (@MangoOnSOL) October 28, 2025 🧠 Why It Matters The largest remittance company on earth is stepping directly into stablecoins. This is massive for both Solana and stablecoins. Solana just got validation from a major payments player on a global scale. Payments is crypto’s biggest real-world use case today, and Solana now anchors the largest remittance migration play in history. As for stablecoins, the are clearly eating the world, and Western Union is capitulating in. Global remittances are a $860 billion market. If even 10% of those flows move to stablecoins over the next two years, that’s $86 billion in annual on-chain volume. Largely on Solana. Stablecoins are the future - and Solana is a part of that future. A really nice narrative win, on the same day that Bitwise’s Solana ETF set the record for highest volume for any new ETF launch in 2025.

Stock futures are rising this morning after major indexes hit record highs yesterday for the third straight session on the strength of a tech sector rally; the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a cut in interest rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting this afternoon; Nvidia (NVDA) shares continue surging after the chipmaker announced a flurry of new deals yesterday; three Magnificent Seven members—Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META)—are scheduled to release quarterly results later today; and shares of Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) are higher after a strong earnings report. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly higher as investors look ahead to the Fed’s interest rate decision later today and another big day in tech earnings. Major indexes are coming off of a third straight session of record highs, led by Nvidia’s (NVDA) surge to a new all-time high. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up 1.2% at $4,030 an ounce, rebounding from several days of declines, while bitcoin was at $113,200, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which can affect borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, was a tick higher at 3.99%. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its highly anticipated interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate for its second straight meeting, dropping the influential rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 3.75%-4%. Investors will be watching how members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote on the decision after a loyalist to President Donald Trump voted for steeper rate reductions at the September meeting. Market watchers will also be focused on comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is due to speak at 2: 30 p.m. ET and is expected to talk about the outlook for inflation, the labor market and the economy broadly, potentially providing insight on the path for interest rates. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading after hitting a record high Tuesday on investor optimism over a string of new deals for the chipmaker. At an Nvidia developer conference in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang announced a $1 billion investment in Finnish tech firm Nokia (NOK), which rose more than 20% on the news. Nvidia also announced new deals with Oracle (ORCL) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) as the chipmaker highlighted its progress on AI development. Nvidia shares were up more than 3% ahead of the opening bell after rising 5% yesterday, putting the world’s most valuable company on a path to open above the $5 trillion market capitalization level on Wednesday. A trio of Magnificent Seven earnings reports are due today as investor optimism about technology stocks continues powering a broader market rally. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) are all scheduled to drop their quarterly results after the closing bell. Microsoft is expected to show an 11% increase in quarterly adjusted earnings amid increased infrastructure spending and Wall Street optimism over its position in the AI race. For Google-parent Alphabet, analysts see near-term momentum on AI for the search giant. Facebook-owner Meta is expected to hit nearly $50 billion in quarterly revenue on surging ad sales, while investors will be listening for details on the company’s efforts to acquire AI talent. Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta were up slightly in premarket trading. Caterpillar (CAT) shares are surging ahead of the opening bell after the heavy-equipment maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results, after missing on earnings in its prior two quarters. Cat’s third-quarter revenue rose 10% to $17.6 billion, higher than the $16.6 billion average estimate of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.95, down from the year-ago quarter but well above the consensus estimates of $4.51. Cat shares were up nearly 5% in premarket trading. Coming into today's session, the stock had gained 45% so far in 2025 and was trailing only Nvidia among the top gainers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

UPDATED 08:00 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2025 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Acronis Cyber Protect Local, a new solution that delivers natively integrated cyber resilience for on-premises, sovereign private cloud, and air-gapped information technology and operational technology environments. Cyber Protect Local is designed for organizations where cloud deployment is not an option and combines backup, recovery, cybersecurity and endpoint management in a single platform. The service delivers agile, resilient and compliant IT and OT operations while reducing costs and operational complexity. The new offering keeps data securely within the customer’s perimeter to ensure full data sovereignty and regulatory compliance, the company says. It supports legacy systems and modern hypervisors, including Windows XP, OT/ICS environments, Nutanix, Proxmox, VMware and Hyper-V, to ensure complete coverage across mixed infrastructures. Acronis says customers benefit from strong backward compatibility, one-click self-service recovery and expanded workload portability for virtual and hyperconverged environments. Acronis Cyber Protect offers natively integrated endpoint security and management and automated discovery of unmanaged devices via Acronis Device Sense that help reduce tooling complexity while enhancing operational efficiency. Physical-to-virtual, virtual-to-virtual and cross-platform recovery are simplified, with no need for separate agent installations to allow organizations to migrate workloads seamlessly while maintaining protection. Key features include unified cyber resilience, with support for backups, recovery, cybersecurity and endpoint management in a single agent and single console. There’s also data sovereignty, with management and data kept within a customer perimeter to ensure compliance, as well as comprehensive workload support, artificial intelligence-driven automation and cross-platform agility. “The systems that ensure we have access to water, electricity, technology, healthcare and transportation are vulnerable targets for cyberattacks due to their reliance on outdated software and hardware,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “Acronis Cyber Protect Local brings the power and innovation of our trusted cloud cyber protection platform directly on-premises, running on a dedicated management server within the customer’s internal networks to meet strict security and data location requirements.” Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including rounds of $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Trump Mulls Replacing Jerome Powell As Fed Chair As Shortlist Narrows

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to remove Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve, citing incompetence. Amid the plot to remove Powell, there is a five-horse race for potential replacements for the current Fed Chair as Trump’s top choice declines the offer. US President Donald Trump has fired a new round of criticisms at Jerome Powell over his handling of the Federal Reserve, hinting at an imminent replacement. According to a report, Trump noted that plans are underway to name a new Fed Chair before the end of the year. Trump disclosed the plans during a dinner for business leaders in Tokyo as part of his week-long trip to Asia. The US President has previously railed against Powell over his refusal to cut interest rates, with the Federal Reserve headquarters fiasco fuelling more criticisms. “We have an incompetent head of the Fed. We got a bad Fed guy, but he’ll be out of there in a few months, and we will get somebody new,” said Trump. Powell’s term as Fed Chair is expected to come to an end in May 2026, bringing an end to a nearly eight-year tenure at the helm of affairs. Early in the week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the administration is considering five potential replacements for Powell. At the moment, the five finalists include White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Bessent noted that he will do one more round of interviews on the five finalists before formally submitting their names to the White House after the Thanksgiving holiday. Meanwhile, Trump had previously tapped Bessent to replace Powell, but the Treasury Secretary declined to serve as Federal Reserve chair. “I’m thinking about him for the Fed, but he won’t take the job,” said Trump on Bessent’s refusal. “He likes being Treasury Secretary, so we’re not thinking about him really.” Despite Powell’s previous reluctance to cut interest rates, cryptocurrency markets are pricing in a rate cut in October’s FOMC meeting. Data from the FedWatch CME tool pegs the probability for a rate cut to 375-400 bps at 99.9%, potentially representing back-to-back cuts after September’s easing. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $113,096, while Ethereum is holding the $4,000 psychological price point. However, investors are eyeing a bullish upswing following forecasted rate cuts that are expected to push the global cryptocurrency market capitalization above $4 trillion.

Title: T. Rowe Price Wades Into the Crypto Arena

The legacy mutual fund provider has filed for a crypto index fund, bringing TradFi and DeFi one step closer together. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and now T. Rowe Price’s bighorn sheep is exploring it. The $1.7 trillion asset manager wants to bring an actively managed crypto index ETF to market, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The behemoth firm’s willingness to enter the nascent crypto market, expanding beyond its traditional, mutual fund roots after almost two years of spot crypto approvals, marks a big step in the acceptance of decentralized finance by legacy mutual fund providers. The fund’s numerous potential holdings also makes it unique: It would hold anywhere from five to 15 coins and aim to outperform the FTSE US Listed Crypto Index. “[T. Rowe Price] follows a bunch of legacy firms that are already in [crypto], but what’s interesting about theirs is that it’s an index,” said Tyrone Ross, CEO of 401 Financial and Turnqey Labs. “It’s actively managed, you get broad exposure, and it’s from an almost 100-year-old name. That’s a big deal.” T. Rowe’s filing comes on the heels of other legacy firms launching their own funds for the first time. Tweedy, Browne, launched its first ETF, COPY, late last year, with others, including Lazard and Praxis, following suit. Meanwhile, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton continue to push for tokenization. The trend is a result of both rampant bleeding across the mutual fund class and an increasingly deregulated crypto environment, Ross said. “It’s one of those things where the regulatory skies have cleared,” he said. “A legacy name, I think that’s going to attract a lot of institutional capital.” A T. Rowe Price spokesperson declined to comment. Other traditional mutual fund providers that launched ETFs this year include: Crypto? I’ll Pass. Still, there are some notable holdouts, namely Vanguard and Charles Schwab, that have yet to launch their own crypto funds. Schwab said it plans to offer spot bitcoin trading in the first half of 2026, but Vanguard executives have for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, with former CEO Tim Buckley telling CNBC in 2018 that Vanguard would “never” launch a bitcoin fund. But the future is less certain. “I’m in the camp that I don’t see Vanguard doing it,” Ross said. “But money is a powerful thing.” Investors who want in on Alpha Architect’s next 351 exchange ETF no longer need at least $1 million — as long as their account is at Charles Schwab. Pictet Asset Management, which oversees $800 billion, recently launched three ETFs that lean on AI, with plans to add two emerging markets strategies early next year. The Goldman Sachs MSCI World Private Equity Return Tracker ETF does its best to replicate PE performance with publicly traded stocks. Banks are writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in loan defaults, and the wind down in CLO trading may not be a bad thing. The acquisition marks one of the first major purchases of an ETF provider by a US crypto trading platform. Either one of these popular tax-advantaged strategies can help clients diversify and defer tax bills, but they can be complex as well as costly. Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Business NEW YORK :Spending updates this week from U.S. megacap companies that are investing massively in artificial intelligence could jolt the AI trade that has been a primary driver of the record-breaking U.S. stocks rally. Capital spending is a crucial component of the AI trade that has propelled equities following the launch of AI assistant ChatGPT in November 2022. With the benchmark S&P 500 up about 17 per cent year-to-date and 90 per cent since the bull market began just over three years ago, investors are on guard for any weakness while wary of parallels with the dot-com market bubble 25 years ago. The rally has been led by a select group, including chipmaker Nvidia, which has symbolized the enthusiasm with its market-leading AI chips and mammoth share-price gains that have made it the world's largest company by market value, on the cusp of an unprecedented $5 trillion. Investment by the biggest companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, serves to build out the infrastructure that supports the burgeoning industry while signaling confidence in the theme, investors said.

Last Updated on October 29, 2025 by Caesar Fikson Profitable niches for affiliate marketing in 2026 reward operators and seasoned affiliates who treat content like a product and funnels like software. We at NowG mapped the niches where budgets are growing, payouts stay sane, and buyer intent is measurable—especially across iGaming, fintech/crypto, B2B SaaS, and high-velocity consumer tech. You’ll see exactly why a niche pays, who to promote, and how to position it so your EPC doesn’t vanish after week two. Quick lens: we prioritize niches with rising TAM, resilient commissions, clean cookies/server-to-server tracking, and strong second-order revenue (upsell, retention, or LTV-backed CPL/CPA). We’re publishing the first 50 niches here; if you want Part 2 (51–100), say the word and we’ll roll it out the same way. 💡 Pro tip: Structure pages as “jobs to be done,” not encyclopedia entries: Choose A vs B → Set up → First win → Level up. Your conversion lift will be… not subtle. Table of Contents For gaming-savvy readers, these are the engines of high-velocity CPA/Hybrid revenue. We favor regulated brands and tools that make bettors/casino players smarter and stickier. B2B payouts are steadier and upgrades extend LTV. Perfect for comparison pages, ROI calculators, and “from template to result” tutorials. Growth persists where outcomes are trackable (weight, HRV, sleep). Pair programs with responsible, evidence-led content and clear disclaimers. Have you considered the downstream impact of stacking niches that naturally cross-sell? That’s where the margin lives. Wallet → exchange → tax software. Sportsbook → odds tool → bankroll tracker. Hosting → email → analytics. We’ve watched this triple ARPU without adding a single new traffic source. 💡 Pro tip: Build “starter bundles” with two-step CTAs (e.g., “Get the wallet → set up the exchange”). Bundle bonuses beat single-program coupons in both conversion and retention. Picture an affiliate team churning out single-product reviews. Traffic looks fine; EPC doesn’t. We at NowG regroup the site into five stacks: Crypto Onboarding, iGaming Toolkit, Creator Stack, Home Security, and Sleep & Recovery. Each stack has one “choose” page, one “set up” page, and one “first win” page. We rewrite CTAs for sequences, wire basic webhooks into a sheet, and measure mission completion instead of raw clicks. Thirty days later: fewer pages, more revenue—session depth +17%, second-conversion +22%, refunds lower. The products didn’t change. The architecture did. Try NowG’s free tools to map your stacks, score offers, and sanity-check time-to-first-conversion before you scale spend. Profitable niches for affiliate marketing keep the lights on when algorithms wobble. We at NowG finished mapping the second half of the list—fifty more niches where commissions are sane, intent is measurable, and the onramp to revenue is short. As before, you’ll get why each niche pays, the best-fit affiliate programs to consider (examples), and the winning angle that turns clicks into money. Lens unchanged: rising budgets, recurring or LTV-backed payouts, clean data access, and obvious cross-sells. Treat these as modules—build stacks and your ARPU compounds. 💡 Pro tip: Pair travel with finance stacks (cards, insurance, lounge access). One “How to build a points-friendly itinerary” guide can monetize three programs instead of one. Have you considered the downstream impact of adding a sustainability pillar to an existing home niche? Conversions rise when you couple cost savings with impact—two reasons to click, not one. 💡 Pro tip: Beauty and pet niches thrive on before/after and progress artifacts. Build a simple “progress log” printable and your retention will quietly climb. Frustrating when carts are full and conversions stall? In home/outdoor, onboarding content beats price cuts. Show the first weekend with the product and buyers stop procrastinating. 💡 Pro tip: Services convert on certainty. Publish response-time SLAs, pricing ranges, and “what happens after you click” flows. Your lead quality will jump. Don’t spin up 50 new categories. Build stacks around intent: Travel Stack, Green Home Stack, Pets Stack, Home/DIY Stack, and Career Stack. Each gets a “choose” page (A vs B), a “set up” page (first week), and a “first win” page (proof of outcome). Ship those three and your site becomes a product, not an encyclopedia. Here’s the bottom line: markets shift; intent doesn’t. If your pages move people from interest → action → result, the commission model barely matters—CPA, hybrid, rev share all work when the user gets a win fast. Try NowG’s free tools to map stacks, model commissions, and benchmark event latency before you scale traffic. Pick niches that cross-sell naturally with what you already rank for. Then prioritize the ones with recurring or LTV-backed payouts and vendors that expose hourly stats or webhooks. Speed to first win beats volume. One decision page (A vs B), one setup guide (first week), and one first-win tutorial per stack. Add a simple calculator or checklist to each. That trio outperforms 10 generic reviews. Limit yourself to stacks, not categories. Publish only pages that move users along the job-to-be-done path—everything else is backlog until the stack monetizes. Most are global with GEO-tuned providers. For leadgen (HVAC, pools, legal), build city/state landing pages and route leads to the right partner. Time-to-first-conversion, second-conversion rate (cross-sell), refund/chargeback rate, and 30/60/90-day EPC. If TTFX falls and 2nd-conversion rises, keep investing. Use iGaming for high-velocity CPA/Hybrid revenue (pair with odds tools and payment rails). Use finance to stabilize cashflow (cards, wallets, tax). They complement each other when sequenced well. We prioritized rising budgets, resilient commissions, and programs with solid data access (hourly stats or webhooks). We also weighted niches that cross-sell well—stacking raises ARPU without new traffic. Do both. Start with one niche you can own, then expand into adjacent products to create a stack (e.g., wallet → exchange → tax). Stacks compound LTV. Decision pages (A vs B), setup guides, and first-win tutorials. Add calculators and checklists to move users from interest to action quickly. Yes, but shadow-model hybrid for 6–8 weeks to reveal true LTV by GEO and to avoid overpaying for bonus hunters.

Title: Top AIG Exec Has Major Fossil Fuel Ties

Time Published: 2025-10-29T09:00:00Z

This article is published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy. At the end of July, a group of residents of Brownsville, Texas, gathered to discuss the risk of explosions from a new methane export facility—Rio Grande LNG—that is being built right next to a SpaceX rocket facility with a history of explosions. Their fear? That their communities risk being blown up due to ongoing accidents in both sectors. Indeed, just the month before, an enormous explosion rocked the SpaceX facility in Brownsville. “They’re attacking us. They’re killing us,” a resident told Telemundo, referring to the extraordinary fossil fuel infrastructure expansion in the border city. More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook Rio Grande LNG is one of the most expansive methane build-outs in the country, with the project set to cost $18 billion and handle a capacity of 17.6 million tons per year of liquefied natural gas, which would make it the second-largest methane export facility in the U.S. Its largest ownership stake is held by NextDecade, a publicly traded fossil fuel firm, but it is also backed by Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity subsidiary of BlackRock, and TotalEnergies, a major French oil and gas firm. Construction has continued despite the project being in ongoing legal limbo, with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals blocking its regulatory approvals last year. Despite the challenges of explosions, legal uncertainty, and the ongoing climate crisis, American International Group (AIG) is insuring Rio Grande LNG. This insurance arrangement comes as a Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) investigation shows that John G. Rice, AIG’s lead independent director, holds the exact same position at Baker Hughes, a global fossil fuel technology company that has received major contracts from both Rio Grande LNG and Calcasieu Pass LNG, which is also insured by AIG. AIG is one of the top ten insurers of fossil fuel companies in the country, and a report by Insure Our Future, a climate advocacy group, found that it collects over $500 million annually in premiums from insuring the fossil fuel industry and held $27.4 billion in fossil fuel investments as of 2022. In addition to the Rio Grande project and Calcasieu Pass LNG Phase 1 (owned by Venture Global), AIG is also insuring Cameron LNG (majority-owned by Sempra and backed by KKR, Mitsubishi, and TotalEnergies) on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, along with historically insuring the Gulf LNG and Freeport LNG projects. The relationship between AIG and Baker Hughes has not been publicly disclosed prior to this. In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), AIG does not disclose that the projects it is insuring give major contracts to Baker Hughes despite the fact that the relationships could be material and, as a result, compromise federal standards on director independence. AIG has only disclosed that Rice is a director at Baker Hughes, not that he is its lead independent director, which is the second-most powerful position in a company when the CEO is also the chairman of the firm, as is the case with both Baker Hughes and AIG. Yaron Nili, a professor at Duke University School of Law who has studied director independence issues, told CMD that AIG’s failure to disclose that Rice is the lead independent director as opposed to an ordinary director at Baker Hughes could be considered “problematic,” and added that there is a “requirement [by AIG] to disclose anything that materially would impact their independence.” “These industries are so intertwined, as evidenced by Rice having these dual roles,” Rick Morris, an insurance campaigner at Public Citizen, told CMD. “They’re sacrificing our ability to get property insurance … in order to continue to make short-term profits off of the very causes of climate change.” The Gulf Coast is one of the most burdened regions on the planet when it comes to fossil fuels, with 20 new or expanded export facilities currently being proposed or under construction. There are now eight functioning LNG export facilities in the U.S., but if all the proposed projects get built nationwide, that number will balloon to 31. Liquefied natural gas is mostly methane, which is 28 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and currently accounts for 11 percent of global emissions. In 2022, a “Banking on Climate Chaos” report estimated that if the 18 proposed new fossil fuel export facilities on the Gulf were completed, they would generate 1.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, equivalent to emissions from 320 million cars. With the growth of fracking and export infrastructure on the Gulf Coast—along with a monumental increase in demand from Europe in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022—natural gas exports have expanded rapidly, with a tripling of U.S. exports between 2019 and 2024. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In January 2024, the Biden administration put a pause on new LNG export approvals, citing environmental and energy security concerns. A federal judge in Louisiana then blocked that pause in June of last year, but in January of this year President Trump ordered it to be lifted on the first day he returned to office. Just before the presidential transition (in December 2024), Biden’s Energy Department also released a report warning that unfettered LNG exports could drive up prices for U.S. consumers and worsen the impacts of climate change. Trump, who campaigned on the promise to “drill, baby, drill” and push American dominance in dirty energy, has firmly rejected that approach. Instead, his administration has fast-tracked new LNG export infrastructure, allowing these exports to hit record highs as the president has tied access to U.S. markets to foreign purchases of American LNG. In the first quarter of 2025, AIG posted $460 million worth of losses from the fires in Los Angeles, which were exacerbated by climate change. Insure Our Future, which advocates for insurance industry accountability in climate change, estimated in December 2024 that $600 billion in property and casualty losses globally were due to climate change–related issues, which accounted for 38 percent of total losses in the sector. “AIG is one of the largest insurers of methane export terminals on the Gulf Coast,” Ethan Nuss, an organizing strategist at the Rainforest Action Network, told CMD. He cited a major disaster in August during dredging as part of the massive new Calcasieu Pass terminal, which will be one of the largest in the world. “There was a huge overflow of dredging sediment into public waterways and fishing grounds of the local fishing communities who have fished those waters for generations,” Nuss explained. Nuss pointed out that AIG generally seems to turn a blind eye to risks when insuring the methane build-out. At one point, the company insured Freeport LNG in Freeport, Texas (also on the Gulf Coast), which experienced a major combustion event in June 2022 that “sent flames shooting 450 feet into the air, injuring beachgoers, shaking residents’ homes and sending tons of toxic chemicals into the air,” according to Melanie Oldham, a Freeport resident, in a 2023 press release. “To this day the community has not received basic safety guarantees from the company that the problems that led to that explosion have been resolved,” Nuss said. In response to investor pressure, AIG released what it calls a “climate roadmap” last year. Yet Nuss says that the firm has continued to prioritize its relationships with the fossil fuel industry. “AIG says that they care about climate and are in the process of developing a climate action plan, but they are actively insuring and backing this very industry that we know is incompatible with a livable climate,” he said. Rice’s role at Baker Hughes shows that there is a “very clear relationship between AIG at a corporate level and their stake in the methane industry. The stakes couldn’t be [higher], not only for those … who live next to these dangerous terminals, with the risk of explosions and loss of livelihood and threats to their health. There’s also the threat to [our] shared climate. We know that if we have any hope of a livable climate we cannot afford to build new methane terminals, full stop,” Nuss said, citing research from the International Energy Agency to buttress his concerns about insurers’ complicity in exacerbating the crisis. Morris of Public Citizen draws a line between AIG’s continued underwriting of fossil fuel projects amid the escalating climate crisis to its role in the 2008 financial crisis, when the company insured complex financial products that detonated the global economy, requiring a $182 billion bailout from the U.S. government. The firm’s share price has never meaningfully recovered in the 17 years since that crisis. “In 2008, the [world] faced a financial crash caused by speculative activities by companies like AIG,” Morris noted. “Those investments caused a crisis in the housing market [that] trickled down to affect every American and just about every country on the globe. [Now] AIG continues to play fast and loose with the U.S. housing market [through] their investments in fossil fuels, spiking the rates that Americans pay for their home insurance. When people cannot afford home insurance … they cannot get a mortgage to buy a home, period. When you look at AIG’s central role in the 2008 financial crisis it is difficult not to draw stark parallels to the crisis we face today.” Morris underscored the critical role insurers play in the fossil fuel infrastructure expansion, noting that “you can’t find investors for a fossil fuel project if that project is not insured first.” AIG—and the insurance industry as a whole—“is bent on squeezing every last cent out of the American people while abandoning them at the very time that they need to rely on their insurance.” In a statement, Baker Hughes told CMD that the company “is committed to ethical business practices, transparency, and full compliance with all applicable disclosure obligations”—yet it failed to make its general counsel available for an interview. We’re entering the final stretch of our fall fundraising campaign, and a generous reader has offered a $15,000 match to help us close the gap. Every dollar you give this week will be doubled. Independent media like The American Prospect stands as one of the last defenses against authoritarianism.

Will the incoming payment chains shake Ethereum’s stablecoin market share? If the test is successful, the payment-focused chain could soon hit the public mainnet for everyone. It signals incoming shifts across the stablecoin payment ecosystem, and whether Ethereum will hold its ground remains to be seen. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is close to launching its Arc chain – A global payment-focused L1 powered by digital dollars. In a statement on 28 October, the firm said that it had begun public testing for the chain alongside key design partners. The partners include top banks, insurers, and asset managers like BlackRock, HSBC, and Absa, among others. According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the partners have billions of users and handle trillions of dollars in assets across the globe. He claimed that Arc can seamlessly allow local markets and builders to connect to the global economy. Allaire called it the “economic OS of the internet,” and added, “This geographic diversity highlights a defining strength of Arc: its purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy.” Source: X Beyond global and agentic payments, Arc also aims to support on-chain FX (foreign exchange) and capital markets (tokenization). In fact, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, underscored FX and tokenization as key interests for them in the project. He said, “Exploring Arc will provide insight into how stablecoin-denominated settlement and onchain FX capabilities might enable more efficient capital markets and unlock additional utility for onchain assets.” Arc is not the only purpose-built project seeking to rewrite payment and capital markets via on-chain rails though. Google, Stripe, and Tether have similar plans. In fact, Tether-backed Plasma [XPL] is already live and handles about $6 billion of the stablecoin supply. It’s now the fifth-largest chain for digital dollars. Source: DeFiLlama Google’s GUCL and Stripe’s Tempo are expected to launch in the near future. Collectively, the new chains could challenge Ethereum’s market share in stablecoin settlement, according to some analysts. Out of the current $305 billion in total stablecoin supply, Ethereum controls $162 billion or 53%. Tron [TRX] handles about a quarter of the overall market, while the rest is shared among other chains. However, in terms of stablecoin transfers, Ethereum’s volumes have been making record figures every month. In fact, for the first time, the stablecoin volume crossed the $2 trillion milestone on Ethereum this October. Source: The Block Even so, it remains to be seen whether Arc, Plasma, Tempo, or Google’s payment chains will grab Ethereum’s market share.

Title: Saudi Arabia could become an AI focal point

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week A state-backed AI21 project hopes to rival China and the United States China and the United States are widely seen as the top two countries making artificial intelligence advancements, but there’s another nation looking to get in the game: Saudi Arabia. The wealth of Saudi businessmen is attracting outside investors to the Gulf kingdom as it tries to entice American tech companies to expand AI operations. But many are skeptical of what Saudi Arabia’s AI push could mean for the tech world and beyond. The nation wants to expand its tech influence by using AI, as “few nations can match the kingdom’s cheap energy, deep pockets and open land,” said The New York Times. All of these things are “ingredients that tech firms need to operate the vast, power-hungry data centers that run modern AI.” The kingdom’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is “seizing a chance to turn Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth into tech influence.” Saudi officials have been trying to woo American tech companies to the desert, with “executives from OpenAI, Google, Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle” all set to meet at an upcoming Middle Eastern investment summit, said the Times. Many of these executives “will be keen to seek out the opportunities that change tends to bring,” said Bloomberg, and will look to “divine the kingdom’s plans for the more than $200 billion it earns each year from oil exports.” The country is additionally building several AI data centers that may further entice U.S. brands.

Riyadh is also looking to strengthen its own AI development through Humain, a state-owned AI company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The company believes it can eventually be the “third-largest AI provider in the world, behind the United States and China,” Humain CEO Tareq Amin said to CNBC. Humain is looking toward U.S. moguls in an effort to boost itself; Blackstone and BlackRock, two of the largest investment companies on Wall Street, are “already vying to invest billions of dollars with the firm,” said Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia is well on its way to building this AI groundwork, as Humain “offers AI services and products, including data centers, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models,” and is also developing a computer operating system that “enables users to speak to a computer to tell it to perform tasks,” said Reuters. But not everyone is happy about Saudi Arabia’s rapid development of AI, largely due to the country’s various human rights abuse allegations and treatment of women. Other experts don’t believe the hype around Saudi tech. Saudi Arabia has a notably “shallow pool of AI expertise,” and many “warn of a global glut in computing capacity as governments and companies race to build data centers faster than they can profit from them,” said the Times. Crown Prince bin Salman has said that Humain’s goal is to handle 6% of the global AI workload — but this could be a stretch. Tech experts “can never say never,” John Dinsdale, a senior analyst for Synergy, said to the Times. “But I can’t imagine any circumstances that would enable Saudi Arabia to achieve 6% of the world’s AI compute capacity.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Photo / Michael Craig The New Zealand sharemarket rose slightly today after a strong lead-in from the US markets. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.05% or 6.553 points at 13,409.21 after 30.7 million shares worth $123 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.07%, closing at 7676.73 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,764.34 after rising 0.19%. There were 72 gainers on the main board and 59 decliners. Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said the market was treading water today. “The index did follow in kind with US markets hitting record highs. “The latter part of our session we came back somewhat,” Sullivan said. “Looking ahead we’ve got a big couple of days for earnings in the US, as well as the Fed, so that’s probably going to be the main macro story for the markets.” Five companies from the “Magnificent Seven” will report over the next day and a half, including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. On the NZ sharemarket, NZME upgraded its financial forecasts and said its revenue was likely to be better than expected. The media company told the NZX this morning it expected operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for 2025 to be between $59m and $62m. That was up on earlier guidance of between $57m and $59m. “NZME is heavily reliant on ad spend and has done a bit of cost-cutting as well. There’s some positive momentum into FY26 for them, midpoint of their upgrade at 12% year on year,” Sullivan said. NZME’s share price rallied 6.67% or 7c to $1.12 after 900,674 shares changed hands on turnover worth $1m. Elsewhere, market minnow New Talisman Gold Mines’ share price rallied by 16.98% to $0.06 after the firm announced it had signed an agreement for the offtake of gold concentrate. However, the regulator swiftly applied a trading halt to the company after the update. “They said their announcement wasn’t price-sensitive, but their stock went up 17%. They said they were freezing it and were going to have a closer look at it. If the market thinks it’s price-sensitive, it probably should have been [treated as such].” Other movers today included Vista Group, which fell 3.91% or 11c to $2.70; A2 Milk, which rose 1.90% or 20c to $10.70; and Contact Energy, which fell 0.63% or 6c to $9.40. Sullivan said the lead-in from the US was interesting, particularly for the fact that it featured the widest ever divergence of companies on the S&P 500 in a positive day. “There were 102 that were positive, and 398 that were negative, and yet the market closed up. That’s the widest it’s ever been. Nvidia now makes up 8% of the S&P 500, the largest since General Motors in the 1970s. “Now when Nvidia moves, so does the market.” Wall Street stocks rose to fresh records again on Tuesday local time as a jump in artificial intelligence player Nvidia’s shares added to bullishness over easing trade tensions and market-friendly central bank policy. All three major US indices climbed to records for the third straight session, with Nvidia piling on about 5% as the chipmaker announced new ventures and chief executive Jensen Huang headlined a company event in Washington. Donald Trump is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea – and rosy comments by the US President have fuelled optimism that the world’s two largest economies, China and the United States, can strike a deal to ease their trade war. – Additional reporting AFP Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business, retail and tourism.

Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has now learned what it means to be treated as a second-tier diplomat, receiving the red card from Beijing. A humiliation and a reprimand for Germany. The school of life can be cruel. Growing up usually means losing lofty ideals, fringe ideologies and the dreamy mindset of an inexperienced existence to the harsh reality of the world. Reality follows its own rules, unimpressed by self-delusion. That moment of maturity, the exit from the bubble of hermetically-sealed party ideology, has now arrived for Germany’s top diplomat. A Minister of Fantasies Johann Wadephul, who only recently wandered through wonderland attributing the German economic miracle to Turkish immigrants, had to cancel his first official visit to China at the last minute because Beijing saw no need to speak with a German delegation. The Christian Democrat is learning, much like his BlackRock-seasoned party colleague Friedrich Merz, that Germany’s dramatic economic decline is being followed instantly by a loss of geopolitical relevance. Wadephul’s first China trip was intended as a reset in the strained diplomatic relationship with Beijing. A high-profile business delegation was set to accompany him and help ease tensions over critical rare earth supplies. China has been threatening a complete export ban for weeks, a measure that would instantly paralyze key German industries. Suddenly Business Matters The delegation was to include representatives from the German automotive industry, Siemens Healthineers, the German Robotics Association and a leading importer of rare earth elements. Together, they were meant to relieve pressure in Beijing and secure access to the essential resources that Germany’s industrial base cannot function without. When Beijing made clear that it would not entertain additional talks beyond the mandatory meeting of foreign ministers, Wadephul was forced to cancel the trip late Friday. A last-ditch attempt to save face and limit the political damage. Perhaps Wadephul should have copied his predecessor Annalena Baerbock and focused on moral-philosophical escapism such as feminist foreign policy. It is harmless, fits the German zeitgeist, and would have earned him brownie points among left-leaning coalition partners. The Giant’s Achilles Heel Right now, Europe would desperately need a delegation that positions itself smartly in the slipstream of the Americans. Every giant has a weakness. China’s economy is caught in a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral triggered by draconian U.S. tariffs and a long-festering property crisis caused by massive state-driven capital misallocation. Deflation is fatal because China’s growth relies on the fiat-credit machine. Rising insolvencies mean shrinking loan books. The credit turbo sputters, collateral values collapse through fire sales and oversupply, especially in real estate. Then the state must intervene again, inject more government credit and weaken its currency further. It is a vicious cycle gripping nearly every modern economy. China’s answer has always been the same: a colossal export-subsidy engine, a mercantilist model built at the expense of trade partners who lost production capacity to China. Beijing’s trade surplus accounts for roughly 1 percent of global GDP. Roughly 1 trillion U.S. dollars, fueled by massive export aid. On top of that come geopolitical Trojan horses like the Belt and Road Initiative, opening markets wherever China needs raw materials. China Is Desperate for Replacement Markets Europe’s internal market has become essential for Beijing to dump excess production. The U.S. market is increasingly blocked since Donald Trump’s tariff offensive: Chinese exports to the United States have crashed by a staggering 27 percent. At the same time, Chinese exports to Germany rose 10.7 percent in the first half of the year. To prevent a labor-market meltdown at home, Beijing is flooding alternative markets with overcapacity. The Communist Party is facing a youth unemployment rate likely around 20 percent. The social explosive lies right there. This is precisely where Europe -- especially Berlin -- could apply leverage. In the escalating struggle for rare earth access, crucial for German industry and especially automakers, Europe could build real bargaining power by teaming up with the United States. Irresponsible and Stubborn It is irresponsible, considering China’s 90-percent dominance in rare-earth refining, not to side with Washington and secure strategic advantages for Europe’s own industrial survival. Ideologically rigid, strategically naive and severely weakened by its trade debacles with the U.S., EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is stumbling from one pseudo-summit to the next like a dethroned Brussels queen. One gets the impression that the entire climate circus, the theatrical solidarity on Ukraine and the delusional green posture have become a psychological overcompensation for the visible failure of the Brussels project. Time to Seek Alliance with the United States Europe should have embraced geopolitical division of labor with Washington from the start. Especially now that the U.S., under a hyperactive foreign-policy president, is openly claiming leadership. Trump is right to point at EU protectionism, ubiquitous climate regulation and a policy increasingly hostile to markets. Washington is on the offensive: deregulation, tax cuts, junking the quasi-religious climate cult. It’s working: the U.S. economy is growing 3.8 percent, new debt fell from 6.7 to 5.8 percent. Trump is recalibrating the system while Europe tumbles in the opposite direction: higher debt, deeper recession. Wadephul and his fellow European diplomats must finally accept this reality and drop their escalating crusade over censorship laws, scrap the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the online-surveillance regime entirely. Instead, they should seek fair trade with the U.S. without hidden climate protectionism. Europe is resource-poor and energy-dependent, importing up to 60 percent of its energy. Without Russian energy and raw materials, Europe’s prosperity model collapses. And the attack on a Eurasian rapprochement between continental Europe and resource-rich Russia did not come from Washington, despite media mantras to the contrary. It came straight from the heart of the European Union. Image: AT via Magic Studio Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it.

This seven-day correction has put an end to one of the longest bull runs in the history of the precious metal. · With markets already factoring in another rate cut in December, traders are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to give them clues about the direction of monetary policy going forward. · Investors, however, kept an eye on developments on a possible trade deal between the US and China that would further reduce demand for safe havens. · A framework deal between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump is anticipated to be finalised. The pact aims to loosen China’s limitations on rare earth shipments and stop more US tariff rises. Technical Triggers · First target achieved in Gold at $3960 (~Rs 119,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to $3850 (~Rs 117,000). · First target achieved in Silver at $46 (~Rs 140,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to 45(~Rs 136,500). Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group As mutual fund houses resume investments in Silver ETFs, should investors consider taking a fresh entry? The lull in silver fund investments by mutual fund houses previously was spurred by supply inadequacies and high premiums on physical silver, now relaxed as global supply chains stabilize. Silver price has also corrected on its peak, creating a healthier entry point for long-term investors. Silver is unique because it can be utilized as a store of value, similar to gold, and it’s also a critical industrial metal that finds applications in semiconductors, electronics, solar panels, and electric vehicles. In the future, the structural demand for silver is set to continue being robust in the face of the global energy transition, increasing renewable capacity, and technological advancement. But investors should keep in mind that silver as a commodity is still a volatile and cyclical asset, which tends to react sharply to changes in global interest rates, inflation expectations, and industrial demand changes. Rather than attempting timing of entries, investors need to invest systematically in order to average out volatility and sharp corrections. How much allocation to Silver ETFs (as a percentage of the overall portfolio) would be advisable for investors as these units become more accessible? The entrance of Silver ETFs, thanks to the fund offerings from various Indian AMCs, opened a new avenue for the investors to invest in silver more comfortably. Nonetheless, the investors’ commitment to having a varied portfolio is still vital, as the precious metal generally experiences more volatility and cycles than investments in stocks or bonds. A diversified portfolio is one where silver exposure of 5-10% through ETFs or mutual funds is usually recommended. Given the nature of silver prices being so volatile, it is wise to adhere to SIPs (systematic investment plans) instead of taking all at once. This approach works by outputting the costs of buying and also cutting down on the risk of poor timing. Moreover, it is also important for the investors to keep an eye on the trading of ETFs at premium or discount prices before they invest since these aspects can have a big influence on the returns. All in all, Silver is an investment category that is very much a part of the diversification and inflation-hedging worthiness. What strategy should existing Silver ETF investors adopt in the current market scenario? For investors already holding silver, staying patient is crucial in the current market. The long-term fundamentals of the metal remain strong due to its steady structural demand. Silver surged to its historic highs in 2025 before correcting sharply, and while Indian ETF premiums have normalized post-Diwali, supply-demand tightness continues. Since silver’s growth story is still intact, investors should view their investments with a long-term holding perspective rather than responding to short-term corrections. With its widespread use in electronics, solar energy systems, batteries, and semiconductors, the metal is crucial to today’s technologically driven world. The technology evolution and the move to using renewable sources of energy keep the silver demand steady, thus reinforcing its long-term price trend. For investors, opting for a staggered investment strategy over gold/silver ETFs or mutual fund is an excellent way to cope with the volatility and possible corrections after such a steep rally, besides seizing the long-term trend. Silver ETFs have delivered strong returns so far. As geopolitical tensions ease and supply-demand concerns persist, what is the outlook for silver and silver-backed assets in the near term and long term? This year, silver has been a very profitable investment, which can be attributed to the strong demand from both industries and investors. Currently, both physical silver and ETFs are experiencing the same supply-demand pressure with demand being the reason for premium trade due to the limitations. Although the trading volumes may be reduced temporarily due to the calming of geopolitical tensions, the fundamentals of the metal are still very strong. Silver is still a key component in the green technologies area, which includes solar panels, EVs, and advanced electronics, so the industrial demand is constant. The prices of silver are backed by the structural demand which the global production cannot meet. The strong demand for this precious metal is a fact that is supported by the market speculations throughout the whole short-term period. Pullbacks in the price of silver should be considered to be the normal phases of a broader uptrend and not a ground for worry by the investors. India’s industrial growth slowed to 3% in H1FY26, but GST reforms, festive demand, and easing inflation may drive a rebound in the second half, says Bank of Baroda. Raymond Lifestyle has appointed Vishal Raigagla as Chief Financial Officer of the company w.e.f. October 29, 2025.

Cyclone Montha weakens into a Cyclonic Storm near Machilipatnam; APDMA warns of continued rain, gusty winds, and flooding risk across coastal Andhra. Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com Bitcoin fell back below $113,000 even as U.S. equities notched fresh records to underscore a widening gap between traditional and digital risk assets. A rotation into AI-heavy stocks after Nvidia’s 5% rise appeared to siphon liquidity from crypto and kept bids subdued. Despite recovering from the October 10–11 shock, resistance above $116,000 persists with limited follow-through from buyers. Analysts flag the short-term holder cost basis near $113.6k as a key pivot. Any failure to hold that level could extend the retracement toward sub-$108k. This would imply a deeper test of structural support. Macro dynamics remain in charge. Equity gains reflect optimism ahead of this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech results. The same liquidity rotation is but weighing on digital assets. A 25 bps US Fed cut is widely anticipated and market reaction will hinge less on the move itself and more on whether Chair Powell signals a pause to quantitative tightening. In the near term, rising Treasury yields and renewed flows into equities imply capital is clustering in safer or higher-performing sectors. This keeps crypto in consolidation rather than a full-blown recovery. Altcoins tracked Bitcoin lower. Ethereum slipped 3% to just under $4,000, while Solana and Litecoin fell nearly 3% to unwind much of their early-week gains. The debut of new spot ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin did little to lift sentiment as traders prioritised risk management over chasing catalysts. Sui (SUI) dropped 4% to $2.50 after a late-day breakdown, with ~2.7 million tokens reportedly changing hands in a single minute. The abrupt volume spike alongside a sharp price slide points to larger holders offloading into thin liquidity. This leaves the token vulnerable to further downside if follow-through buying does not emerge. Overall, the tape still looks like post-October digestion. It is strong enough to avoid decisive breakdowns but lacks the conviction to sustain rallies until macro clarity and fresh capital return.” Jefferies on Shree Cement Recommendation Buy; Target Price ₹33420, Earlier Target ₹35150 Miss on higher cost;

Given the sheer extent of the consultative paper and related documents, we are still in process of grasping the material to evaluate the likely impact. However, four key proposed regulations are noteworthy from a TER and AMC revenue standpoint. ▪ With an objective to rationalize cost for unitholder, additional expense of 5bps that was allowed in equity TER has been removed from the draft MF Regulations. PL View: This would be a negative for AMCs as 5bps would be directly reduced from equity TER ▪ To pass on any change in statutory levy in future, TER limits are revised downward to the extent of GST on all expenses other than MF fees. Hence, across slabs TER has been proposed to be reduced by 10bps PL View: While the wordings are a bit ambiguous this may mean that TER will have to exclude the GST impact which was roughly 10bps. Assuming that statutory levies would be permitted over and above the TER limit, this may not have a material adverse impact. ▪ To protect investor interest and ensure that expenses are charged only once, brokerage has been revised from 12 bps to 2 bps for cash transactions and 5 bps to 1 bps for derivative transactions. All other execution-related transaction costs may be charged on actual basis. PL View: As per SEBI, since AMCs already charge an MF fees, additional brokerage over and above 2bps would lead to a dual impact on customer. This would certainly be negative for brokers. ▪ A provision enabling TER to be charged based on performance has been introduced and same shall be voluntary for AMCs. A detailed framework in this regard shall be finalized separately in consultation with stakeholders. PL View: AMCs would be allowed to charge additional performance-based TER which would be a positive, increasing revenue; final guidelines are awaited. Sector/stock impact: We expect AMCs may pass on the 5bps equity TER cut to other industry participants however assuming no pass through, core earnings for ICICI Pru, HDFCAMC, NAM, ABSL AMC and UTIAM would be affected by 8.0-9.0%. The impact would be more severe for CRAMC at ~22% due to ~90% equity share. This negative effect has been partly neutralised by proposing a performance-based TER (framework to be finalised). Reduction of the cash brokerage from 12bps to 5bps and derivative brokerage from 2bps to 1bp would adversely affect brokers Gold stabilizes at $3,950 an ounce amid expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut after a three-day decline. Shares of Indian asset managers drop after SEBI proposes changes to mutual fund fee structures, signaling potential profitability concerns.

Title: Mobile-Internet Convergence Drives Verizon/Eaton Fiber Deal

by Pivot 5G AI BROADBAND NATION CYBERSECURITY FIBER BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS M&A MARKET RESEARCH MOBILE POLICY RURAL BROADBAND VIDEO Verizon’s announcement this week about the company’s commercial agreement with Eaton Fiber is the latest example of how important the “killer bundle” of mobile and internet service has become. Or, as Verizon put it in the press release, the goal is to “accelerate Verizon’s broadband and mobility convergence strategy.” Customers who buy both mobile and internet from the same provider generate higher average revenue and are less likely to churn in comparison with customers who only buy a single service. While mobile service is widely available nationwide from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, no provider has a nationwide broadband footprint. But all three providers are expanding where they offer broadband. Verizon’s plan to purchase Frontier will expand the company’s reach to 31 states and the District of Columbia. The agreement with Eaton Fiber, an affiliate of Tillman Global Holdings, will target markets outside of Verizon’s and Frontier’s current fiber-to-the-home footprint. According to the press release, Eaton Fiber will “fund and build the network and be responsible for network maintenance and installation.” Verizon’s responsibilities will include sales, marketing, and end-user customer service. The wording of the release suggests that other providers also will be able to use the network, but Verizon will have a head start. “Verizon will be the exclusive retail provider of residential fiber services over the new network through the build phase and for an additional time period, ensuring competitive advantage in subscriber acquisition,” the release states. AT&T also has been making fiber deals targeting areas outside its broadband footprint. The company also has a joint venture with BlackRock to expand its fiber reach. Although T-Mobile has had tremendous success with its fixed wireless offering, the company lacks the expansive fiber footprints that AT&T and Verizon already have. Unsurprisingly, the company’s fiber strategy, in large part, has been to acquire fiber assets that are already in the ground, through joint ventures to acquire Lumos and Metronet. In addition, T-Mobile has its own deal with Tillman Fiber. Telecompetitor is a publication of Pivot.

Title: Panama Canal Opens Search for Partners in $2.6B Dual-Terminal Project

By Glenn Taylor As the Panama Canal’s operator turns its focus to developing new port terminals on both sides of the trade conduit, it has launched a “consultation process” designed to identify possible partners that would control the gateways. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) made the announcement Monday after holding an invite-only meeting including members of both major container shipping lines and global port and terminal operators. In August, the ACP indicated it planned to sell rights to two plots of land reserved for the construction of two new ports near the canal. These two ports would be individual transshipment terminals—Corozal on the Pacific Ocean and Telfers serving the Atlantic Ocean. Combined, the two terminals are expected to boost the country’s overall container-handling capacity from 9.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to 15 million TEUs annually. The construction of the terminals is expected to cost $2.6 billion, with both scheduled to begin operations in 2029 upon completion. As part of the process, the authority will conduct a market and feasibility study for both terminals. Following this stage, a general project plan will be developed which will lead to the initiation of a special process to select a concessionaire for each terminal.

Topics Cosco, OOCL Rack Up $43M in Port Fees in First Week After USTR Penalties Take Effect The selection will include a pre-qualification phase, a one-on-one dialogue stage with pre-qualified participants, and finally, the awarding of the concession contracts. The final phase of the selection is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2026. Approximately 8,100 direct and indirect jobs are expected to be generated during construction, the ACP says, with that number jumping to 9,000 once operations begin. The project is forecast to provide an economic impact of between 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent of Panama’s gross domestic product (GDP). Representatives from terminal operators included Maersk-owned APM Terminals, Cosco Shipping Ports, CMA Terminals, DP World, Port Houston, PSA International and Mediterranean Shipping Company’s (MSC) Terminal Investment Limited. The ocean carriers consisted of CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping, Evergreen, Hapag Lloyd, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), Maersk, MSC, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Yang Ming and ZIM. “We think that if it isn’t done here in Panama, it will happen elsewhere in the region, and we have to decide whether we want to stay competitive,” said Víctor Vial, vice president of finance at the ACP, at the Monday press conference. For the ACP, and for Panama in general, the desire to foster more competition at the canal comes as geopolitical tensions have put the waterway and the country under the microscope from both American and Chinese interests. A proposed $23 billion mega-deal which would see Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison sell off the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, as well as more than 40 others worldwide, to a consortium of MSC and BlackRock, has been in limbo since the summer. That acquisition occurred weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, and was considered a massive win for his administration as it aims to curb Chinese influence in the region. Conversely, Beijing and China’s President Xi Jinping were unhappy with the deal, with China’s antitrust regulator opening a probe into that transaction, and later pushing for state-owned Cosco’s inclusion. The acquisition is under scrutiny from some in Panama’s government as well, with the country’s Supreme Court currently presiding over a lawsuit that alleges Hutchison’s recent 25-year extension to operate the Balboa and Cristóbal ports is illegal. If the high court rules in the favor of the comptroller general who filed the suit, the port sale would be annulled. If the contract is voided, it would take between 12 and 18 months to get a new concession tender ready, said José Ramón Icaza, Panama’s minister of canal affairs. “We don’t control the scenarios, but what I can say is that President [José Raúl] Mulino and a few members of his cabinet, including myself, are working on a plan for any of those scenarios and that if we have to take control of Balboa and Cristóbal we don’t create a disruption of the supply chain in the region,” Icaza said. The constant tug-of-war among the parties has driven concerns among ACP leadership that a concentration of terminal operators at the canal-adjacent ports would pose risks to the waterway’s neutrality. Panama’s $2.6 billion port project is one tranche of a wider 10-year, $8.5 billion plan to modernize the canal by 2023. The plan includes the $1.6 billion construction of the Indio Rio reservoir, which will be built to supplement the canal’s main supply of water from Lake Gatún and add capacity for an additional 11 to 13 daily transits. Additionally, the other major project within the 10-year blueprint is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) liquefied gas pipeline that could transfer up to 2.5 million barrels per day between the Corozal and Telfers terminals without sailing them through the canal.

The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom helped push the major indexes higher Tuesday after a raft of partnership announcements. Meanwhile, shares of a cruise operator encountered rough seas as adverse weather and cost pressures weighed on its outlook. Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record run Tuesday as the Federal Reserve also kicked off its two-day meeting, with expectations running high that policymakers will decide to lower interest rates by another quarter point Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, the Dow rose 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.8% to set fresh closing records. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of the day's market moves. Nvidia (NVDA) shares powered up 5% to an all-time high after CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote speech at the company's developers conference in Washington, D.C. The event brought a flurry of announcements from Nvidia, including a $1 billion investment in Nokia (NOK), as well as a new strategic partnership with the Finnish tech firm, whose shares soared nearly 23%. Nvidia also said it will collaborate with Oracle (ORCL) to build AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and team up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) on the development of an integrated AI technology stack. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) gained close to 12% after the biotechnology firm posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Strong sales of eczema treatment Dupixent and skin cancer treatment Libtayo helped drive the performance. Regeneron also said it plans to resubmit an application for a higher-dose version of Eylea, a treatment for various diseases that affect the retina. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), manufacturers of radio-frequency chips for smartphones and other devices, announced a plan to merge. Both semiconductor makers have been navigating headwinds related to major customer Apple (AAPL), which began developing its own modem chips for use in its devices. Shares of both companies added about 6% following the merger announcement. United Parcel Service (UPS) shares surged 8% after the package delivery giant topped analysts' estimates with its third-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share. The company highlighted progress on a turnaround plan that includes efforts to streamline operations, close underutilized facilities, and reduce its workforce, with 50,000 positions cut so far this year. PayPal Holdings (PYPL) shares climbed 3.9% after the payments provider said it would partner with ChatGPT operator OpenAI. Users who are shopping on ChatGPT will be able to check out using PayPal, while PayPal will connect its global merchant network with ChatGPT to provide opportunities for sales on the AI platform. Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on life science and technology properties, missed estimates with its third-quarter revenue and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a key measure of REIT profitability. The firm also lowered its full-year AFFO forecast, pointing to lower occupancy projections in North America and slumping demand in the life science industry. Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities plunged nearly 20%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) sank 8.5%. The cruise operator's revenue for the third quarter came in slightly below expectations, and its outlook for the fourth quarter also fell short of forecasts. Weather disruptions along with increased operating and interest expenses contributed to the cloudy outlook.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia, already the world leader in chips crucial for artificial intelligence, wants to make its technology central to everyday life. That means everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington, DC, on Tuesday. With AI already playing a major role in consumers’ lives and the economy, that kind of ubiquity would cement Nvidia’s role in a tech arms race now spanning the globe. Nvidia’s at a critical juncture. It has partnered with the world’s top companies, has the ear of President Donald Trump and became the first public firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation over the summer. But it’s also navigating a bevy of challenges, including escalating concerns about whether the AI market is a bubble waiting to burst, growing competition from rival chipmakers AMD and Qualcomm and trade restrictions. In the face of that competition, Nvidia is sending a clear message: While its semiconductors power most of the world’s AI data centers, the company does way more than just design chips. Huang also told CNN he doesn’t believe there is an AI bubble. He argued that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. “AI is now profitable, meaning AIs are now so good that they deserve to be paid for,” he said. The chipmaker’s stock (NVDA) ended up nearly 5% on Tuesday. Nvidia on Tuesday said it’s releasing a blueprint for how other firms should build massive, “gigascale” AI data centers, which it calls “AI factories,” the likes of which Oracle, Microsoft, Google and other leading tech firms are investing billions in. The most powerful and efficient of those, the company says, will include Nvidia chips and software. A new Nvidia AI Factory Research Center in Virginia will use that technology. But Tuesday’s updates go far beyond data centers. Nvidia announced a partnership with telecom firms T-Mobile and Nokia to build “AI-native” 6G cell phone towers, the next generation of wireless technology. The system will use a new Nvidia product, the Aerial RAN computer, that includes its chips and software. When deployed, the technology is expected to provide a faster, more powerful connection for cell phones and a range of other AI devices, such as speakers, glasses and, eventually, robots. “Wireless technology around the world, largely today, is deployed on foreign technologies … that has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift” to 6G, Huang said. Nvidia plans to help build 100,000 self-driving cars in partnership with Uber staring in 2027 — using Nvidia’s chips and “DriveOS” autonomous vehicle operating system — so more people around the country can get rides from robotaxis. It’s providing Palantir with computing power and AI models to help companies build AI agents and systems to automate processes. Lowe’s, for example, will use the tech to create a digital replica of its global supply chain to find opportunities for greater efficiency and cost savings. With Siemens, Nvidia is releasing technology to make “digital twins” of robotic factories. Companies that use it to design, operate and monitor the work of robots doing “dangerous jobs” while helping to fill half a million manufacturing job openings, according to the chipmaker. Nvidia is also partnering with the US Department of Energy to build seven new quantum supercomputers with its AI chips to advance the agency’s scientific research. Nvidia has framed the current AI era as the next industrial revolution, but most companies that have deployed AI tools aren’t yet seeing a return on that investment, MIT said in an August report. And some of the technologies the company is betting on, such as smart glasses and self-driving cars, haven’t yet been widely adopted. The conference’s location in Washington, DC, is no accident. Huang has become a central figure in Trump’s push for the US to dominate AI, and that sentiment was on full display during the keynote — where congressional staffers were offered a special entrance. “The first thing that President Trump asked me for is (to) bring manufacturing back, bring manufacturing back because it’s necessary for national security,” Huang said, adding the company’s AI Blackwell chips are now “in full production” in Arizona, although they must be packaged (a final assembly step) abroad. Huang is set to meet with Trump in South Korea this week during the president’s visit for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Nvidia said in August it was seeking clarity from the White House on how it could restart sales of its advanced AI chips to China, after agreeing to pay the US government 15% of its China revenues earlier this year. On Tuesday, Huang said the White House has approved sales of its chips to China, but Beijing is now blocking those sales. Huang borrowed from Trump to close out his keynote: “Thank you all for your service in making America great again.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Oracle and IPDN signal next phase of tokenization as RWA market surges
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=541340
Time Published: 2025-10-28T20:00:49Z
Full Content:
Oracle and IPDN are building the next layer of institutional blockchain infrastructure. The moves highlight how legacy firms are accelerating real-world asset adoption. Both companies are capitalizing on institutional demand for blockchain-based settlement and compliant RWA trading infrastructure. According to a16z and HTX Ventures, the tokenized asset market has surged to $30 billion, quadrupling in just two years. Oracle and Professional Diversity Network [IPDN] are the latest traditional firms diving into blockchain infrastructure, underscoring a rapid shift toward institutional-grade tokenization. Oracle announced the launch of its Digital Assets Data Nexus platform on 27 October. It is built to help banks and financial institutions issue, manage, and settle tokenized assets on-chain. Meanwhile, IPDN also revealed a strategic collaboration with QBSG Limited to develop a global Real-World Asset (RWA) Exchange. This is designed to bridge regulated capital markets with blockchain rails. Together, the two announcements mark a new front in the corporate tokenization race. Legacy tech firms and public companies are now building infrastructure to bring traditional finance fully on-chain. Recent on-chain data show the RWA market has entered a period of exponential growth. According to a16z crypto report, the total RWA market has expanded fourfold in the past two years, reaching $30 billion in tokenized value. Additionally, BlackRock leads the pack with $2.6 billion in tokenized Treasuries, while Ethereum hosts $9.6 billion in total RWA issuance. Data also indicates that tokenized private credit is valued between $12–$16 billion. This represents over half of all RWA activity. Oracle’s entry shows a major shift in how institutions approach blockchain adoption. Its new platform promises compliance-ready infrastructure for on-chain settlement. This is a critical component as major banks move toward tokenized credit and liquidity products. Similarly, IPDN’s RWA Exchange adds a regulated marketplace layer, supporting the tokenization of equities, real estate, and commodities. Both efforts align with broader industry moves by JPMorgan, Citi, and BlackRock, all of which have unveiled tokenization pilots this year. From private credit to tokenized Treasuries, real-world assets are no longer a niche experiment; they’re becoming the backbone of institutional blockchain adoption. Oracle and IPDN’s latest moves reinforce that the race to tokenize traditional finance is now firmly underway — and the market, already worth tens of billions, is just getting started.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Amazon Stock To Move After Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is slated to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and some traders are betting the results can lift the stock, the laggard of the Magnificent Seven so far this year, to a fresh record. Amazon stock is expected to move about 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to recent options pricing data. A move of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put Amazon shares at about $243.50, an all-time high, or $215. Amazon's $2.4 trillion market capitalization makes its stock one of the most impactful in the U.S. equity market. A big share price move after Thursday's results would have a larger effect on the major indexes than nearly every other stock. Amazon stock has moved an average of 4.7% following its four most recent earnings reports. Shares slumped more than 8% after the company in July reported cloud revenue growth that disappointed Wall Street after strong showings from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). The last time Amazon stock rose following an earnings report was this time last year, when the company topped sales and earnings estimates on strong cloud and advertising growth. Amazon is the worst-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven so far this year, with the company’s outsized tariff exposure weighing on shares. The stock is up just 5% since the start of the year. Amazon’s retail business is contending with increased tariff costs and increasingly squeezed consumers, while its cloud computing unit is making massive data center investments to meet demand for AI workloads. As such, cost savings will be top of mind for investors during Thursday’s earnings call with executives. Amazon on Tuesday announced it would cut 14,000 corporate roles, reportedly part of a larger downsizing that could see the company slash up to 30,000 office jobs, nearly 10% of its white collar workforce. And according to a recent New York Times report, some executives expect warehouse robotics to keep the company from hiring as many as 600,000 workers in the coming years. Cloud growth and capital expenditures will also be in focus. Amazon’s infrastructure investments totaled more than $31 billion in the second quarter, about 20% more than Wall Street was expecting. Chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky forecast the second quarter's spending would be "reasonably representative" of capex spending for the remainder of the year.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Amazon Stock To Move After Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is slated to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and some traders are betting the results can lift the stock, the laggard of the Magnificent Seven so far this year, to a fresh record. Amazon stock is expected to move about 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to recent options pricing data. A move of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put Amazon shares at about $243.50, an all-time high, or $215. Amazon's $2.4 trillion market capitalization makes its stock one of the most impactful in the U.S. equity market. A big share price move after Thursday's results would have a larger effect on the major indexes than nearly every other stock. Amazon stock has moved an average of 4.7% following its four most recent earnings reports. Shares slumped more than 8% after the company in July reported cloud revenue growth that disappointed Wall Street after strong showings from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). The last time Amazon stock rose following an earnings report was this time last year, when the company topped sales and earnings estimates on strong cloud and advertising growth. Amazon is the worst-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven so far this year, with the company’s outsized tariff exposure weighing on shares. The stock is up just 5% since the start of the year.

Securitize, a pioneering platform in asset tokenization, has announced its intention to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The platform disclosed the strategic move on October 28, 2025, with this set to mark a major development for the tokenization industry. Securitize is at the forefront of bringing global financial institutions onchain. The move sees it join a growing number of crypto-focused companies going public across Wall Street and elsewhere. In its case, the platform, renowned for its role in tokenizing assets for entities such as BlackRock and Apollo, will merge with Cantor Equity Partners II as it eyes the $1.25 billion listing. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. The transaction is anticipated to generate up to $469 million in gross proceeds, including a $225 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing round. This capital infusion will enhance Securitize’s ability to scale its operations and advance its mission of making capital markets more accessible and efficient through tokenization. 8/ The deal is expected to deliver $469M of gross proceeds consisting of an upsized $225 million in committed common stock PIPE, anchored by new and existing blue-chip institutional investors, and $244 million of cash held in CEPT’s trust account, assuming no redemptions. — Securitize (@Securitize) October 28, 2025 The merged entity, to be renamed Securitize Corp., will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ.” Going public sees Securitize cement its position as a leader in the tokenization space. The platform, which has facilitated over $4 billion in tokenized assets, could attract even more attention as a public entity. The company’s platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem, integrating with major blockchains and financial institutions. It stands out as the first vertically integrated, SEC-registered tokenization provider. BlackRock and Apollo are among firms to tokenize funds with Securitize. “This is a defining moment for Securitize and for the future of finance,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Securitize. “We founded this company with a mission to democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient through tokenization. This is the next chapter in making financial markets operate at the speed of the internet and is another step in our mission to bring the next generation of finance onchain and tokenize the world.” The public listing of Securitize is expected to accelerate the adoption of tokenization across traditional financial markets. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Brandon Lutnick noted: “We believe that blockchain technology has massive potential to transform finance, and partnering with Securitize underscores our confidence in tokenization as a foundational force in the next era of capital markets.” The real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market has expanded by 135% over the past year, reaching a total value of $35 billion, according to recent data. Analysts at Citi project that the tokenized RWA sector could climb to nearly $4 trillion by 2030.

Vanguard Group has turned artificial intelligence from a pilot program into a profit engine, generating more than $500 million in measurable business value across customer service, analytics and software development, according to MIT Sloan Management Review. The $11 trillion asset manager’s methodical rollout shows how large financial institutions can use AI to boost productivity while maintaining trust, governance and employee engagement.

Δ As mentioned in MIT Sloan analysis on Monday (Oct. 27), Vanguard’s first wave of AI deployments focused on service and productivity. Its “Crew Assist” tool, powered by Azure OpenAI, helps call-center representatives handle investor inquiries more efficiently, while an automated report generator produces customized market summaries for more than 150,000 advisers. Both tools have reduced call-handling times and improved customer satisfaction. The firm’s “Digital Advisor” applies machine learning to model job-loss risk and unemployment duration, tailoring financial-planning recommendations even for clients with minimal balances. A separate call-summarization model automatically drafts meeting notes and follow-ups, reducing administrative work by nearly 50 percent. Vanguard’s research arm has also trained a large-language model on 22,000 corporate earnings-call transcripts to forecast dividend cuts. Companies flagged as negative were five times more likely to announce reductions within a month, underscoring how generative models can supplement traditional financial analysis. As reported by MIT Sloan, Chief Information Officer Nitin Tandon said AI is “embedded where it makes the most difference in decisions that improve investor outcomes and streamline how our teams deliver value.” While Vanguard has taken a focused, high-ROI approach, JPMorgan Chase is expanding AI across the enterprise. Its “LLM Suite” supports more than 200,000 employees and includes 175 active AI applications, from automated research assistants to wealth-management tools that helped boost sales. And JPMorgan isn’t the only company to tap into AI-powered tools for insights into wealth management. BlackRock has also integrated generative AI capabilities into Aladdin, its portfolio management platform used by global institutions, providing portfolio managers with faster insights into exposures and scenario analysis. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Half of Vanguard’s 20,000 employees have completed its internal AI Academy training program, designed to improve literacy and responsible use. Each system is monitored for drift, bias and performance under the company’s governance framework. Chief Data Analytics Officer Ryan Swann told MIT Sloan Review that Vanguard’s success sees “the best outcomes when humans and machines collaborate, not compete.” That approach mirrors findings from the World Economic Forum’s AI in Financial Services report, which found that 70 percent of financial executives expect AI to drive revenue growth but warned that scaling safely depends on workforce readiness and governance discipline. Citigroup is also emphasizing human-AI collaboration through its “agentic AI” system, Stylus Workspaces, which allows employees to perform multi-step workflows, such as market analysis and report summarization, with a single prompt. The tool connects directly to Citi’s internal databases and collaboration platforms, turning AI into an end-to-end task manager. The rollout began in September and is expected to expand globally next year. Across the industry, finance leaders are shifting from cost-based AI metrics to performance-based ones. A PYMNTS report found that CFOs increasingly view AI as a driver of growth and revenue rather than just operational savings, a change reflected in how firms like Vanguard and Citi quantify ROI in business terms rather than experimentation.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Burlington Stores, the retailer formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, has taken 42,575 square feet for a store at the as-yet-unbuilt 72-22 Broadway in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. Adam Heller, Stephen Weber and Joshua Singer from the Heller Organization represented the landlord, Werber Real Estate. Clifford Simon, David Rosen and Jake Simon from CNS Real Estate repped the tenant. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unavailable, though CNS classified the lease as “long-term.” Retail asking rents in Jackson Heights for this quarter equaled around $64.10 per square foot, according to CoStar. Burlington’s new Jackson Heights store is scheduled to open in September 2028. 72-22 Broadway is set to be a 13-story, mixed-use building with 60,000 square feet of retail on three levels, with two floors dedicated to office and the rest multifamily residential, Clifford Simon told CO. “Burlington’s arrival is a strong addition to the Jackson Heights community, bringing much-needed affordable soft goods to one of the city’s busiest transit hubs,” Heller said in an email to CO. “We’re excited about the continued momentum in the area as this corridor continues to thrive as a key shopping destination in Queens.” Traded was first to note the lease, which was signed in August. Burlington has been busy on several fronts after opening 101 new stores in 2024 and aiming for around the same number this year. The company took over 45 leases from Joann in May 2025, including at 535 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, following Joann’s second bankruptcy filing in January 2025. The month before, Burlington paid over $257 million to BlackRock to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse in Southern California where the company had been the sole tenant since 2019, as CO previously reported. Burlington also signed a 12-year, 77,970-square-foot lease at RXR and Hudson Bay Capital’s 620 Avenue of the Americas in December 2024 in a move from 695 Avenue of the Americas, as CO previously reported. The company took over the spot of the former Bed, Bath & Beyond outlet. Werber Real Estate, as Roosevelt 72 LLC, purchased the Jackson Heights site — also using the address 72-11 Roosevelt Avenue, according to public records — from Delco Properties for $24 million in May 2020. Representatives for Burlington Stores, Werber Real Estate and the Heller Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Title: AI monetization and capex in focus for Meta as Wall Street heads toward Q3 earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-q3-earnings-preview-ai-spending-monetization-capex-instagram-reels-2025-10
Time Published: 2025-10-28T17:56:13Z
Full Content:
Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's plan to spend more than ever on AI after the company announced earnings that were dragged down by a $15.9 billion tax charge. The social media giant and AI hyperscaler reported revenue of $51.24 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $49.5 billion. Earnings per share came in at $6.03, compared to estimates for $6.72. The stock fell more than 9% in after-hours trading. Meta said that its AI infrastructure spending will continue to rise, and that 2026 cap-ex will be "notably larger" than 2025. On a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said that a "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing." In the "very worst case," he said, Meta will have pre-built capacity and will absorb the depreciation costs. Much of the call was spent discussing Meta's superintelligence lab — for which the company spent heavily to recruit talent — and its ability to monetize. Zuckerberg said that the lab's research enabled "new technological capabilities" that improved the company's products. Meta CFO Susan Li said that a number of "youth-related trials" slated for 2026 could also result in "a material loss." She also walked through the one-time $15.9 billion tax charge and said Meta expected its taxes to decrease in future years due to the Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Act. Catch up on the play-by-play from Meta's Q3 earnings call with analysts below: Zuckerberg closes out the call by saying that Meta is "seeing the returns" for AI in its core businesses, and that it gives the company "confidence" it should do more. "We want to make sure that we're not underinvesting," Zuckerberg says. Meta's stock is trading down around 8.5% as the analyst call concludes. "There's a lot of value to create with AI overall," Zuckerberg says. He says Nvidia has "extremely well-deserved success" in hardware, and that cloud partners are also finding lots of opportunity. AI app companies are "relatively small," he says, but there is a "huge opportunity." The technology industry has not seen this "rate of new capabilities," Zuckerberg says. New businesses can be built around these new capabilities, he adds. Zuckerberg says work on Meta's AI Ray-Ban and Oakley collaborations is going "very well" and will likely be a "very profitable investment" if strong sales continue. Some revenue will come from selling devices, and others will come from services on top of them, he says. The AI will become the "main thing" people are using the glasses for, Zuckerberg says. Meta CFO Susan Li says Advantage Plus ad tech improvements have led to a 14% lower cost-per-lead. Meta is working to broaden adoption of automated solutions, she adds. Advantage Plus is an "ongoing platform," she says. ARR for advertisers using automated options is $60 billion, and there's "room to continue growing that," she says. Zuckerberg says it's "valuable" that a lot of people use Meta's AI models, and that there's a clear correlation between model improvements and usage. He says that the Superintelligence Lab is the "highest talent density lab in the industry." The models will "improve monetization" by improving engagement and advertising, Zuckerberg says. Zuckerberg says research will enable "new technological capabilities" that will be useful in a variety of products, from an AI assistant to a business AI to feed rankings. The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come.

The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come. "I think being best in a given area will drive great returns," he adds. Zuckerberg says Meta is trying to "build novel capabilities," and is not interested in any "check the box" exercises. Meta is working on a foundation model, but also advancing its inference models, Li says. Even "small-scale improvements" like small ad improvements grow revenue in a meaningful way, she says. Zuckerberg says that there was no specific timing for new models or products from the superintelligence team to be announced on the call, but that he was "excited to share more." Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta's ballooning infrastructure costs, saying the company is intentionally "front-loading" compute investments to stay ahead in the race toward superintelligence. He tells analysts that even if Meta overbuilds its data center capacity, the downside would be limited. In the "very worst case," he says, the company would have simply "pre-built for a couple of years," absorbing the costs through depreciation while eventually growing into the extra capacity. Zuckerberg argues that the greater risk is underinvesting, noting that Meta's AI research, recommendation systems, and potential external compute offerings could all profitably use far more compute than the company currently has. They "continue to see improvements in usage" of Meta's AI, Zuckerberg says. Once they have "truly frontier models with novel capabilities," there is great opportunity, Zuckerberg says. He predicts that the ability to plug in "leading models" will lead to a large amount of use. More intelligent models will also improve the core business, Zuckerberg adds. "There's quite a bit more to do," he says. While the stock had ticked up slightly to be trading around -7% mid-way through the call, it's dipped back down after hours. A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." Meta is trying to "plan ahead" to be able to meet necessary capacity in 2026, as well as 2027, and 2028, Li says. Their "foremost priority" is building the "compute that we need" to succeed in AI, Li says. There are "headwinds to the Quest headsets" since Meta does not have a new headset on the market this year, Li says. Meta is still expecting significant year-over-year growth in glasses in Q4, Li says. Li says that growth in CapEx is from all areas, including non-AI spend, but that AI needs are "growing the most." Li says that expenditures on ad ranking and performance efforts are paying off. There is "very strong year-over-year growth" in weighted conversions, she adds. Meta expects spending on AI talent to be one of its biggest cost drivers next year as it continues an aggressive hiring push. CFO Susan Li says employee compensation will be the company's second-largest contributor to expense growth in 2026, largely reflecting a full year of pay for AI specialists hired throughout 2025 and new technical recruits in priority areas. She says the increased payroll comes alongside rising infrastructure costs, as Meta's compute needs have "continued to expand meaningfully" and the company plans to "invest aggressively" in both its own data centers and third-party cloud capacity. Li says that, depending on the results, they may result in "a material loss." Meta expects that infrastructure costs will expand, Li says. They expect "invest aggressively to meet these needs," Meta's CFO says. She says it will put "upward pressure" on CapEx. Li says that advertising revenue will drive growth, partially offset by Reality Labs introducing new Quest devices. Meta lifted its CapEx outlook. Investments in ads and "organic engagement initiatives" will enable "strong revenue growth," Li says. The staged data centers will allow Meta to build capacity quickly in future years "as we need it," Li says. Meta continues to observe "performance improvements" as it combines ad models, Li says. Meta is also piloting a new runtime ads ranking model, she says. It has driven a more than 2% lift in Instagram conversions, she says. Meta has more generative AI features for advertisers, Li says, including AI-generated music. These tools "drive increased performance," she says. Li says that global time spent was up on both Facebook and Instagram in the US thanks to video. Meta is developing foundational ranking models to yield more relevant recommendations, Li says. Users have created 20 billion images with Meta AI products, Li says. Since creating the Vibes AI feed, media creation on the Meta AI app has increased tenfold. Meta's headcount as of September 30 was 78,450, representing an 8% year-over-year increase. The CFO says that Meta was hiring in areas like monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, and Superintelligence. The headcount metric included in Meta's before the recent superintelligence unit layoffs. Advertising demand has increased, Li says. Average price-per-ad was up 10% year-over-year. Reality Labs revenue was up thanks to retailers stocking up on Quest headsets before the holiday season, she says. While Meta paid a one-time $15.9 billion tax charge, Li adds that the company expects its taxes to go down due to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta's Ray-Ban Connects sold out in "almost every store" within 48 hours, Zuckerberg says. Demo slots are fully booked up through the end of next month, he adds. Zuckerberg says that Meta will invest more in the area. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says artificial intelligence is already boosting engagement — and profits — across the company's apps. In his opening remarks, he says AI-powered recommendation systems have led to 5% more time spent on Facebook, and 3-10% more time on Threads, with video viewing on Instagram up more than 30% over the past year. "Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion," Zuckerberg added. He said Meta's "three giant transformers" — AI models powering Facebook, Instagram, and ads — are increasingly driving how people discover content and how advertisers reach them. "Retention is looking good" for Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, Zuckerberg says. Usage is growing week over week, and it is an example of a new type of content, he adds. Zuckerberg says that there have been two eras of social media: content from friends and family, and content from creators. The next "corpus" of content will be from AI, he says. That will make recommendation systems valuable. The ARR for Meta's AI-powered ad tools has hit $60 billion. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. The Meta CEO also says that they are building an "industry-leading" amount of compute. He adds that he wanted to "aggressively frontload" building capacity for superintelligence. In the worst case, he says, Meta can "slow" building infrastructure. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Suan Li are on the call. They'll begin by reading through their prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts in a live Q&A. Meta said it expects to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion on infrastructure this year as it builds out the computing power behind its AI ambitions, slightly higher than the $66 billion to $72 billion range it projected last quarter. The company said its demand for computing capacity has "expanded meaningfully," prompting bigger investments in data centers and cloud services. Meta added that its infrastructure spending will keep rising next year, with capital expenditure growth in 2026 expected to be "notably larger" than in 2025. Meta paid a one-time tax charge of $15.93 billion this quarter. The company expected a "significant reduction" in federal cash tax payments thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July. The act's implementation allowed for a "valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets," the company said, causing them to pay a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.

The act's implementation allowed for a "valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets," the company said, causing them to pay a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Otherwise, Meta says: Meta's Reality Labs revenue was $470 million with an operating loss of $4.432 billion for the quarter. The division houses Meta's AI consumer hardware, virtual reality gear, and metaverse spending, among other things. That includes Meta's Ray-Ban Displays, which the company announced in September. Reality Lab's losses are shrinking, albeit slightly, with the company losing $4.53 billion last quarter. Third Quarter Results Source: Bloomberg Forrester VP and Research Director Mike Proulx told Business Insider that Meta's third quarter was "flooded with feature updates, device announcements, and operational moves," with AI as the common thread. "Of particular note is the launch of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which effectively launched a new computing platform," Proulx said. "During the earnings call, I'll be listening for an update on sales. I suspect these glasses will mostly attract early tech-curious adopters, and that demos will far outpace actual purchases." He added that Reels' prominence on Instagram continues to grow as the app edges closer to TikTok, and that advertisers are unlikely to pull back spending despite Meta losing brand-safety accreditation from the Media Rating Council, given the platform's reach and performance. Meta has quietly assembled one of the most expensive AI teams in Silicon Valley under its Meta Superintelligence Labs division, hiring top researchers from DeepMind and OpenAI and spending billions on infrastructure. Yet the elite unit responsible for building next-generation AI models — literally named TBD — remains a black box. Investors will be listening closely for any clues from Zuckerberg on what, exactly, it's building. In September, the company debuted its new Ray-Ban Displays at the Connect conference. The glasses come with a built-in screen that displays text messages, maps, and captions over the real world. The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store."

The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store." Expect further questions on the analyst call about the sales mix between the screen-free Meta Ray-Ban AI glasses and the more expensive Ray-Ban Displays. In September, Meta released its new short-form AI video feed, Vibes. Some tech founders and execs quickly roasted it as "AI slop." Days later, OpenAI released its new video generation model, Sora 2. Its own short-form Sora app quickly topped the App Store charts. OpenAI has said that 1 million people downloaded the Sora app within five days, while Similarweb data indicates that the Meta AI app's downloads surged by 100,000 after the Vibes feed launched. We might get some further data points on Vibes engagement among Meta's users on the earnings call. Meta has faced some dramatic changes to its headcount in the past few months. After doling out big contracts to staff up its superintelligence unit, Meta cut 600 jobs from it. Meta also cut staff in its risk division as the company automated its review process, per a memo viewed by Business Insider. These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers."

These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers." It'll be interesting to see if Zuckerberg or CFO Susan Li talks about plans for future head count growth — or if they anticipate head count to remain flat or decrease in the coming quarters. When Facebook rebranded to Meta in 2021, Zuckerberg declared a "very long-term bet" on the metaverse. The company then spent billions on projects like Horizon. The fervor has since quieted, though the company announced a new AI feature to build 3D worlds with text at its September Meta Connect event. On Monday, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees the company was reshuffling its metaverse unit in a memo viewed by Business Insider. "The priority of the metaverse work remains unchanged, and it continues to be a companywide priority," he wrote. Mark Zuckerberg said Meta could spend up to $72 billion this year on AI infrastructure. Will Zuck raise that number even higher? It's possible, but if all this AI capex spend is really hurting Meta's free cash flow and margins, investors might start feeling uneasy. That's why they'll be laser-focused on Meta's advertising business, which still makes up most of the company's earnings. If ad numbers are healthy — and right now, expectations from Wall Street are high — then Zuck probably has more runway for his AI bets. Tech analysts at DA Davidson wrote ahead of Meta's earnings that they're watching for how Meta does compared to its Magnificent Seven peer Alphabet, which also reports results on Wednesday. "We expect META to continue outgrowing Google's ad revenue, though growth may decelerate on tougher comps (including elections)," the firm said in a client note. "We do not expect growth at Google to decelerate significantly, though we are monitoring OpenAI closely, as we believe the likely introduction of advertising around ChatGPT may create a headwind for Google Search advertising growth."

Title: The world's 10 richest people are $500 billion wealthier this year, thanks to the AI boom

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Title: What Caused Constellation Energy Stock To Surge By 80%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/28/what-caused-constellation-energy-stock-to-surge-by-80/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:16:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy—altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P/E ratio. Let’s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it’s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What’s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that’s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging – particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.

Amazon layoffs 2025 shook the tech world. The company is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs. That’s about 4% of its white-collar staff. The move is to boost its AI transformation. Most cuts hit tech and office roles, not warehouses. CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon must get leaner and faster. Investors liked the shift. Amazon stock (AMZN) traded near $226.97, edging higher. Wolfe Research kept its $270 target, citing stronger margins and AI growth.

Title: Buy Or Sell Adobe Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers thick margins at a reduced price. Here are some statistics. While growth in revenue is beneficial, this should not be viewed merely from a growth perspective. Pricing power along with high margins contributes to consistent and predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and enables capital to be reinvested. The market typically rewards such stability. Beyond the financials, a couple of structural advantages drive Adobe’s outlook. The company is a leader in digital media and enterprise software, and has pivoted to a subscription model that drives recurring revenue. Its integrated workflow solutions create high switching costs, helping customer retention. The company is also witnessing growing adoption of its creative and enterprise tools enhanced by generative AI. For context, Adobe offers a range of software solutions globally, including its Creative Cloud subscription, catering to enterprise clients across Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. However, do these figures truly paint the complete picture? Explore Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe possesses an enduring advantage that remains resilient beneath the surface. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework can tilt the odds in your favor. Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is the Data Here’s our selection process: We target stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and filter out those exhibiting high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also exclusively focus on stocks that have significantly decreased in value over the past year. Below are the statistics for stocks where this selection strategy has been applied since 12/31/2016. However, Consider the Risks That being said, Adobe has encountered substantial declines in difficult times. It fell about 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decline was around 60%. Even the less severe downturns, such as those in 2018 and during the Covid pandemic, resulted in a loss of approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite the favorable aspects, Adobe does not escape the impact when markets decline. Nonetheless, the risks are not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even during strong markets – consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Refer to ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from steep drops in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Corporate America is offering clues about how it sees its workforce meshing with AI

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo — also seen by BI — Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind "Yellowstone" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Michael Dell’s son aims to transform the home power business by selling electricity and backup battery power like a Costco membership

Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. Zach Dell watched his father Michael become one of the richest men in the world building a home computing and tech empire, and now he’s aiming to revolutionize the home electricity business with his Base Power. Austin, Texas-headquartered Base, which just completed a $1 billion fundraising round in October, takes the “Costco membership” route by offering a one-stop shop for the home: electricity and a backup-power solution courtesy of a battery storage system, not a standard gas generator. “We’re addressing a very acute problem that consumers face, which is that electricity has gotten more expensive and less reliable,” Zach Dell, 29, told Fortune. “It’s totally crazy if you think of all the things that have gotten better over the last decade, and our power has gotten noticeably worse. Batteries, paired with software and a unique business model, can make your power more reliable and less expensive.” U.S. power demand is rapidly rising thanks to the AI boom and, when coupled with aging grid infrastructure and rising occurrences of wildfires and natural disasters, backup power is becoming more desirable for many homeowners. Base’s business model offers standard retail electricity, a monthly membership fee of $19, and a leased battery system for a one-time cost of $695—as opposed to a whole-home, backup generator system that can cost upward of $15,000. Base customers may pay more per month because of the membership fee, which covers ongoing services and software battery power management, but they avoid paying the massive one-time cost of a whole-home generator system. “We’re just dramatically more affordable. Do you want the Lamborghini or the [Toyota] Corolla?” Dell said. “We make a product that is reliable, it’s safe, it’s affordable. It’s really a mass-market product. The other companies in the space are selling a premium product to very wealthy folks. Our product is more designed for the mass market.” His Dell Technologies founder and CEO father, Michael, is not involved in Base. Top investors include the venture capital firm Addition, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet’s CapitalG, and many more. Thus far, Base only operates in Texas, including the Austin, Houston, and Dallas regions. But Base, which was founded in 2023, is pivoting from startup mode to ramped-up growth mode, and the tentative plan is to begin expanding outside of Texas in 2026, Dell said. “We have this big, fast-growing business in Texas,” Dell said, “but the long-term ambition is to bring Base to every household in America.” Base Power has deployed over 100 megawatt-hours of residential battery capacity and is building its first battery factory in downtown Austin. A second factory is planned as well. The vertical integration model will further drive costs down over time, Dell said. “The capital will really be used to invest in this vertical integration strategy and get to scale so we can deliver the most affordable product on the market,” he said. “This is our first-generation [battery] product. As we come out with new versions of the product, prices will go down because our economics will get better.” While Michael Dell is not directly involved in Base, he does regularly offer business advise to his only son, who seemingly inherited the entrepreneurship gene. “He’s an extremely valuable mentor” Zach Dell said. “I’m inspired by him not because of how much money he’s made or the stock price, but because of the joy it brings him to build something and to solve hard problems and work on interesting puzzles. I’m very lucky that I get to spend my days solving really hard and complicated puzzles with smart people.” Zach Dell grew up in the Austin area before attending the University of Southern California. He dabbled in startups before joining Blackstone and then working at Thrive Capital. He started to study energy markets and saw the energy transition moving toward solar power coupled with battery storage. Dell said Base is focusing on battery storage in part because the technology is advancing, it’s scalable, and it’s easy to install for homeowners. And the stored power in the battery keeps your home powered when outages occur. A second battery is offered at a deeply discounted rate for larger homes. Prices are kept relatively lower because, when your power is working normally, the battery can store power and then provide electricity back to the grid when demand is at its highest. In the event of a prolonged power outage, Base customers can even buy a smaller, roughly $500 generator to power just the battery system if it runs out of juice on its own. “With that integration, it’s effectively an infinite backup product,” Dell said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

October 27, 2025 15:00 ET | Source: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. News Highlights SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced two next-generation systems at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) designed to expand America’s leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), the Lux AI supercomputer and the Discovery supercomputer. Discovery and Lux will be DOE flagship supercomputers designed to drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security. Both systems directly support the U.S. AI Action Plan by accelerating AI-enabled science, strengthening national competitiveness, and advancing secure, sovereign AI infrastructure for the nation. Together with the U.S. government, ORNL and industry partners, AMD will deliver advanced computing platforms that help national researchers, agencies, and innovators tackle pressing challenges in energy, medicine, health, and national security. When fully deployed, the Lux and Discovery systems will represent a combined $1billion investment of private and public funding which will enable the DOE to build a secure, federated and standards-based infrastructure for sovereign U.S. AI and science. “We are proud and honored to partner with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to accelerate America’s foundation for science and innovation,” said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO, AMD. “Discovery and Lux will leverage AMD’s high-performance and AI computing technologies to advance the most critical U.S. research priorities in science, energy, and medicine – demonstrating the power of public-private partnership at their best.” The Lux AI supercomputer – co-developed by ORNL, AMD, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and HPE and powered by AMD Instinct™ MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Pensando™ advanced networking technologies – will be deployed in early 2026, making it the first US AI Factory supercomputer setting the stage for novel public and private partnerships. The Lux system will address the immediate needs to expand the DOE’s AI leadership and accelerate progress and innovation in the areas of AI, energy research, materials, medicine and advanced manufacturing. The Discovery supercomputer deepens the collaboration between the DOE, ORNL, HPE and AMD. At the heart of Discovery are next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs, codenamed “Venice,” and AMD Instinct™ MI430X GPUs— a new MI400 Series accelerator engineered specifically for sovereign AI and scientific computing. MI430X extends the leadership AMD architecture for AI and HPC, enabling the U.S. to train, simulate, and deploy AI models on domestically built systems that protect national data and scientific competitiveness. “Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “That’s why the Trump administration is announcing the first example of a new commonsense approach to computing partnerships with Lux. We are also announcing, as part of a competitive procurement process, Discovery. Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together.” “The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before,” said ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer. “ORNL’s leadership in supercomputing has dramatically shortened researchers’ time from problem to solution across a host of fields and industries. With Discovery, the integration of high-performance computing and AI promises breakthroughs at the accelerated speed and scale necessary for continued U.S. leadership in an increasingly competitive global environment.” “We are proud that the partnership between HPE and AMD is at the forefront of advancing the next generation of supercomputing in the AI era for Oak Ridge National Laboratory,” said Antonio Neri, president and CEO at HPE. “HPE’s newest supercomputing solutions harness converged AI and HPC architectures, enabling the lab to achieve unprecedented productivity and scale. This collaboration also reinforces American leadership in applying AI to science, energy and national security.” “Oracle is honored to work alongside the Department of Energy to help drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle will deliver sovereign, high-performance AI infrastructure that will support the co-development of the Lux AI cluster.” Lux AI Supercomputer: Advancing U.S. AI Leadership Lux at ORNL is the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security—purpose-built to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI foundation models that will accelerate discovery and engineering innovation. Lux is designed to accelerate AI-driven science through its advanced architecture, optimized for data-intensive and model-centric workloads. As a critical resource for the DOE and the National Laboratory system, Lux will give the United States an early and decisive advantage in deploying frontier AI capabilities that transform the pace and scale of scientific innovation. By dramatically expanding the nation’s capacity for scientific AI, Lux strengthens U.S. leadership, accelerates AI-for-Science, and helps ensure that the breakthroughs of the AI era are discovered, developed, and deployed in America. Lux will unleash a new generation of scientific capabilities across the DOE’s mission to, reveal nature’s hidden structure, discover breakthrough materials, accelerate energy innovation, transform biology and biosecurity, and advance national security and resilience. Discovery: America’s Next Leap in Scientific Computing Purpose‑built for AI and science, Discovery features a “Bandwidth Everywhere” design that allows science and AI applications to run efficiently and deliver productive results. Importantly, Frontier laid the foundation for this work, and together with HPE Cray Supercomputing GX5000 – its next-generation supercomputing platform – Discovery builds on that success with a consistent programming environment to ensure an easy transition for users. Discovery will be the DOE’s next flagship supercomputer at ORNL, arriving in 2028, and will extend U.S. leadership in HPC and AI. Advancing America’s innovation agenda, Discovery reflects a strong, public‑private commitment to keep the United States at the forefront of AI and scientific innovation. Building on the breakthroughs of Frontier—the world’s first exascale system—Discovery is designed to deliver dramatically higher performance, energy efficiency, and AI capabilities. Discovery will drive breakthroughs in energy, biology, advanced materials, national security, and manufacturing innovation. It will help design next-generation reactors, batteries, catalysts, semiconductors, and critical materials. Key Points of Discovery: ORNL is expected to take delivery of Discovery in 2028, with user operations expected in 2029. Once online, Discovery will serve as a cornerstone of the American AI Stack, advancing the science, security, and innovation goals that define the nation’s next decade.

Title: Geraldine Weiss Had An Interesting Formula

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. When a stock sports a dividend yield above its own historical average, one of two things has happened. The company may have raised its dividend – usually a good sign. Or, the dividend yield may have gone up because the stock’s price went down. That suggests there’s been bad news, but it hints at a possible bargain. Some investment professionals seek out stocks whose dividend yield is above their own normal level. Probably the best-known practitioner of this approach was the late Geraldine Weiss, who wrote a book called Dividends Don’t Lie. I wrote a column about the Geraldine Weiss approach in September 2024. The five stocks I selected returned 23.4% in the ensuing year, beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 at 17.6%. Those figures are total returns, both price gain (or loss) and dividends. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. I’d like to give Weiss’s approach another try. Here are four stocks that look good to me now, based on her method. The infamous Enron Corp., which went down in the flames of accounting fraud in 2001, has several surviving children. One is EOG Resources Inc. (EOG); the initials once stood for Enron Oil & Gas. Based in Houston, EOG produces the equivalent of more than one million barrels of oil a year. Its mix is about 31% natural gas and 69% oil and natural-gas liquids. Over the past ten years, EOG’s typical dividend yield has been about 1.8%. Today the yield is 3.7%. Geraldine Weiss fans, take note. EOG has been increasing its dividend rapidly in recent years. In 2019 the dividend was $1.01 a share. In the past four quarters the payout has been $3.77. Molson Coors Beverage Co., a brewer based in Golden, Colorado, has averaged a 2.5% dividend yield over the past decade. Today the stock yields 4%. The shares have done miserably over the past ten years, losing close to half of their value. Many investors think that beer is a buggy-whip industry. U.S. beer sales have been declining, and imports are grabbing an increasing share of a shrinking pie. Sensibly, Molson is trying to diversify away from beer, offering hard cider, hard seltzer, canned cocktails and energy drinks. These days, many investors think of Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), which is based in Denmark, primarily as a weight-loss drug maker. I, however, think of it primarily as a leader in diabetes medications. The stock peaked at about $147 last year, and has descended all the way to $53 as Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) has moved to the front in weight-loss drugs. After its fall, Novo Nordisk shares yield 3.3%, well above the ten-year median of 1.9%. The company’s net profit margin is above 35% and its return on stockholders’ equity is about 81%. Even if those figures decline some, I think the stock is a bargain, selling for about 14 times earnings. Based in New York City, Interparfums Inc. makes and sells perfume and cologne under a wide variety of licensed brands, such as Coach, Karl Lagerfeld, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. Its dividend yield has normally been about 1.7%. Now it’s 3.2%. The stock has declined, partly because sales and earnings growth have slowed, and perhaps partly because investors fear a recession. It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%. My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients. Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager, owns EOG personally and for clients.

It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%. My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News GroupNews Commentary – Gold prices held above $4,100 per ounce through late October 2025, extending a year that has delivered over 25% gains since January and positioned the precious metal for its strongest annual performance since 1979[1]. This sustained rally at elevated levels drove mining profit margins to unprecedented territory[2], with producers seeing margins effectively double as operational costs remain relatively stable while gold continues to commands prices above $4,000 per ounce. Against this backdrop of record bullion values and enhanced economics, exploration and development companies across multiple jurisdictions are accelerating programs, among them Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), First Mining Gold Corp. (TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF), Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF), U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO), and Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA). Bank of America raised its 2026 gold forecast to $5,000 per ounce, citing unorthodox fiscal policies and rising debt levels as persistent tailwinds for the metal[3]. Meanwhile, JPMorgan projects prices averaging $3,675 per ounce by Q4 2025 before climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026[4], with sustained central bank purchasing and investor demand averaging 710 tonnes quarterly underpinning the forecast, creating compelling timing advantages for companies advancing high-grade projects toward production. Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF) has reported continued exploration success at its Tembo-area licences, where Barrick Gold's Bulyanhulu joint venture completed 12 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,380 metres during Q2 2025. The results confirm the geological continuity between Barrick's flagship Tanzanian mine and LVG's 100%-owned adjacent ground. "Barrick's methodical exploration is confirming the geological architecture we've interpreted on our licence area," said Marc Cernovitch, President and CEO of LVG. "As they advance, LVG benefits from both the direct geological insights and the potential for substantial contingent payments—creating a rare opportunity of value addition through a combination of near-term potential production development at Imwelo and the Tembo project, and discovery leverage through the Buly exploration." The Q2 drilling confirmed favorable geology, intersecting mafic metavolcanics (greenstone) and quartz porphyry dykes, which display weak to moderate deformation and have associated silica-sericite alteration, and localized disseminated pyrite and quartz veining—promising indicators for gold mineralization in this highly productive district. Rock-chip samples from artisanal workings near zones of strong chlorite-sericite alteration, indicate the presence of potentially mineralized structures. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement executed in 2022, LVG may receive up to US $45 million in contingent payments from Barrick, subject to future discoveries or defined resource thresholds on these licences. The results reinforce the geological continuity between the Bulyanhulu Mine and the Tembo Project area, validating LVG's long-standing interpretation of the belt's broader potential. "We are encouraged to see Barrick's sustained exploration momentum and technical validation across the Tembo-area licences," said Simon Benstead, Executive Chairman and CFO of Lake Victoria Gold. "Their work continues to confirm the fertility of this part of the Lake Victoria Goldfields, where LVG remains a significant stakeholder through both our adjacent 100%-owned Tembo Project and the contingent upside tied to future discoveries." This strategic exposure comes as LVG accelerates its fully permitted Imwelo Gold Project toward construction. The company recently commenced drilling at Area C, the highest-grade zone within the project located just 12 kilometers from AngloGold Ashanti's flagship Geita mine. The approximately 24-hole, 4,000-metre program at Area C is designed to finalize pit design, strengthen resource confidence, and test for extensions at what management views as the priority starting point for mining. Previous drilling at Area C has returned high-grade results, including 6.8 metres at 14.6 g/t gold from 32 metres and 2.0 metres at 7.5 g/t from 22 metres, confirming strong production potential. The drill mobilization follows LVGachieving a pivotal agreement in principle with the Government of Tanzania on the government's statutory minimum 16% free carried interest. This fulfills a core regulatory condition. Together with environmental approval of the Updated Environmental and Social Management Plan, the regulatory pathway is now cleared for construction advancement. Imwelo operates under a 10-year renewable mining license with metallurgical recoveries surpassing 90%. This translates to an exceptional 90 cents of recoverable value per dollar of contained gold. Critically, Lake Victoria Gold is targeting first gold within 12 months of breaking ground. Financial momentum accelerated in September as LVGofficially closed an oversubscribed $6 million financing alongside a $2 million concurrent private placement. Proceeds fund work programs satisfying conditions for a pre-paid forward purchase facility with Monetary Metals to finance mine construction capital. Beyond Imwelo, the Tembo Project delivers additional optionality. A planned 3,000m drilling program at Ngula 1 is scheduled, where historical intercepts of 28.57 g/t gold over 3 metres signal toll milling opportunity. The timing proves strategic. Lake Victoria Gold is mobilizing equipment at a fully permitted project in one of Africa's premier gold districts precisely when high-grade ounces command maximum value.

(TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF) is expanding its newly discovered Miroir target at its Duparquet Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi region, with drill hole DUP25-064 returning 3.23 g/t Au over 25.9 m, including 11.20 g/t Au over 2.0 m and 10.16 g/t Au over 1.4 m. The company has completed approximately 16,000 m of drilling in 2025, with 20 holes totaling ~4,450 m at Miroir alone, extending mineralization to 100 m depth while expanding the interpreted geophysical fold target to a 140 m strike length. "The Miroir target continues to deliver new discoveries within the largely underexplored volcanic setting of the Duparquet Project," stated Dan Wilton, CEO of First Mining. "The strong grades and widths encountered to date provide new and exciting opportunities in our review of development scenarios that can now include near-surface, higher grade mineralization potential." Drilling at Miroir follows initial discovery hole DUP24-048, which returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m in 2024, with recent step-out hole DUP25-066 delivering 1.37 g/t Au over 30.6 m approximately 45 m east of the headline intercept. The Duparquet Project currently hosts 3.44 million ounces Au in the Measured & Indicated category at 1.55 g/t, plus 2.64 million ounces Inferred at 1.62 g/t across a 19 km strike along the prolific Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone. Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF) has expanded its 2025 exploration program at Golden Queen by an additional 3,800 metres following positive Phase 3 drilling results, with core holes at Hilltop intersecting 1.94 g/t Au and 27 g/t Ag over 4.4 m and 5.11 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag over 1.5 m, bringing total planned 2025 drilling to 8,100 metres. At San Bartolome in Bolivia, the company has secured environmental exploration permits and social licenses in partnership with COMIBOL under a long-term agreement to purchase up to 7.0 million tonnes of oxide ore, with 5,500 metres of shallow core drilling set to begin in Q4 2025 targeting approximately 800,000 tonnes grading 150-250 g/t Ag across multiple projects including Turqui, Tacobamba, Ánimas, Santa Isabel, and Trapiche. "Our exploration teams have made strong progress this year at both Golden Queen and San Bartolome," said Yohann Bouchard, President of Andean Precious Metals. "At Golden Queen, Phase 3 drilling has intersected encouraging mineralized intervals that confirm continuity and support potential mine-life extensions, while upcoming infill work at the Starlight Vein is designed to further expand Main Pit 2. In Bolivia, our partnership with COMIBOL is advancing multiple targets under a long-term ore supply agreement that secures access to up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore. This program is designed to extend San Bartolome's mine life and maximize throughput of the existing 5,000 tpd mill without major capital spend." The Golden Queen program has drilled 3,903 metres across 20 core holes at Hilltop to date, with all holes intersecting projected low-sulfidation cryptocrystalline quartz veins that extend mineralization up to 280 metres along strike, while infill drilling at the Starlight Vein will support expansion of Main Pit 2, which is currently in production. The company anticipates releasing an updated mineral resource and reserve statement with supporting NI 43-101 technical report in the first half of 2026, integrating new geological data from the expanded drilling program that collectively positions Andean as a growing Americas-focused precious metals producer with quality assets across its California and Bolivia operations. U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO) has successfully completed its 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Gold-Copper Project in Alaska, executing 169 scout auger drill holes across the 7.5 km by 4.5 km Whistler Orbit and completing systematic mapping and sampling at the Muddy Creek intrusion-related gold system. The program identified multiple new porphyry intrusive occurrences at top-of-bedrock and determined that much of the till overburden is shallower than previously interpreted, positioning drill-ready targets closer to surface across the 514 km² property located 150 km northwest of Anchorage. "We are pleased to have successfully completed our 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Project in line with our objective to develop a pipeline of targets for potential future discoveries that will underpin growth opportunities for the Project," said Tim Smith, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. GoldMining. "We also welcome the recent U.S. Federal decision to approve the Ambler Road in north central Alaska, which further supports our belief that the prevailing political tailwinds at all levels of government will help to expedite the successful permitting and ultimate development of the proposed West Susitna Access Road, which is expected to connect the Company's 100% owned Whistler Gold-Copper Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage, Alaska." The Whistler Project contains over 20 advanced gold and copper prospects including the Whistler and Raintree deposits, which host a combined mineral resource estimate of 294 Mt at 0.68 g/t AuEq for 6.48 Moz AuEq Indicated, plus 198 Mt at 0.65 g/t AuEq for 4.16 Moz AuEq Inferred. Mapping at Muddy Creek identified new zones of increased quartz vein density containing abundant to massive sulphides including antimony-bearing minerals, with 106 rock grab samples and 7 silt samples collected across a 5 km by 2.5 km area, with assays pending from both the Whistler Orbit scout drilling program and Muddy Creek surface sampling. Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA) has been engaged by Australian Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency The Hon Dr Kevin Rudd AC, to provide a comprehensive briefing on its Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project ahead of the October 20, 2025 meeting between Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington DC. The briefing follows the company's recent US$43.4 million award from the U.S. Department of War to accelerate development of a fully integrated U.S. antimony supply chain, targeting military-spec antimony production by 2026/27, with the Estelle Project's 514 km² land package hosting over 20 advanced gold and antimony prospects across a 35 km mineralized corridor in Alaska's Tintina Gold Belt. "Being invited to brief the Australian Government for this high-level meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump is a testament to the strategic importance of the Estelle Project," said Christopher Gerteisen, CEO of Nova Minerals. "With antimony recognized as a critical mineral and our gold resources adding significant value, Nova is well-positioned to contribute to both U.S. and Australian critical minerals strategies. The US$43.4 million DoW award and our secured land at Port MacKenzie underscore our commitment to building a secure, domestic supply chain for antimony and supporting U.S. defense and industrial needs." The company's proposed antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie, supported by a secured 42.81-acre land use permit, will produce antimony trisulfide, antimony trioxide, and antimony metal for military and industrial applications. Nova's strategic positioning has been reinforced by antimony's inclusion on the U.S. Department of the Interior's Draft 2025 Critical Minerals List and the recent U.S. Federal Government approval of the Ambler Road, signaling increased policy support for responsible resource development in Alaska and alignment with the proposed West Susitna Access Road that would connect the Estelle Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage.

This surge has brought its year-to-date gains to an impressive 50%. The recent upward trend is primarily due to a series of analyst upgrades and increased price targets. This favorable sentiment follows the company's robust performance and strategic developments showcased at its recent Fal.Con event in September. With the stock currently valued around $520, investors are enjoying significant gains. The key question now is: After this remarkable rise, is CRWD stock still a worthwhile buy? While there are minimal fundamental concerns regarding CRWD stock, we view it as a costly choice at its current trade price of approximately $520. The major concern is that its current valuation seems very high. We arrived at this conclusion by comparing CRWD's present valuation with its operating performance over the past few years and its current and historical financial conditions. Our examination of CrowdStrike across essential metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company maintains a strong operating performance and financial situation, as elaborated below. That said, if you are looking for upside with reduced volatility than holding an individual stock like CRWD, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with less risk than the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let’s confront the obvious issue first – valuation. When evaluating the price per dollar of sales or cash flow, CrowdStrike appears extraordinarily expensive. These ratios imply that investors are paying a substantial premium for anticipated growth. The question arises whether that growth can warrant such elevated valuations. Here’s where the narrative takes an intriguing turn. CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been nothing less than impressive, making a strong argument for why investors might accept those elevated multiples. This persistent high-growth trajectory in the crucial cybersecurity sector indicates that CrowdStrike has discovered a successful model. The company continues to outpace the wider market significantly. This is where CrowdStrike's story becomes more intricate. In spite of remarkable revenue growth, conventional profitability metrics reveal a troubling situation. This contrast suggests that CrowdStrike is investing heavily in growth while generating solid cash flows. The company seems to be focusing on expanding market share over immediate profitability. Despite challenges to profitability, CrowdStrike's balance sheet is robust and offers essential flexibility for its growth strategy. What contributes to the strength of the balance sheet? The financial stability metrics are outstanding: This financial robustness enables CrowdStrike to persist with aggressive investments without being concerned about funding limitations. Assessing CrowdStrike's performance during downturns aids in understanding its resilience as a long-term investment. CrowdStrike tends to undergo more dramatic fluctuations but demonstrates substantial recovery capacity, likely due to the vital role of cybersecurity services. Check out our dashboard on – How Low Can CRWD Stock Really Go – for more information. Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a proactive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics. CrowdStrike poses a classic conflict between growth and value. The company merges outstanding growth with robust financial stability, categorizing it as a high-quality business. However, its current valuation around $520 seems excessive, even for a firm with such remarkable fundamentals. Naturally, we could be mistaken in our evaluation, and investors might continue to be willing to pay 30 times or more for CRWD stock revenues. Nonetheless, investors should also consider the associated risks. We believe that waiting for a more favorable entry point may be the better option, as the existing price seems to reflect a lot of anticipated future success.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shopify (SHOP) shares have surged 21% in the last month and are currently priced at $172.95. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it may be advisable to lower exposure to SHOP shares at this time. Our main concern lies in the current valuation, as a price point of $121 may not be unattainable. We believe there is minimal risk in SHOP stock given its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, due to its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive. Here is our analysis: SHOP stock has increased significantly lately, making it appear relatively expensive at this time. Although this might seem like a chance, there are substantial risks associated with investing in a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy, as practiced with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers considerable value. Additionally, contemplate how the long-term performance of your portfolio could be enhanced by including 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors evaluated, but first, for a quick overview: With a market capitalization of $224 Bil, Shopify delivers a global commerce platform that enables merchants to showcase, manage, promote, and sell products across various sales channels. This table illustrates how SHOP is growing in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: SHOP Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how SHOP's profitability compares against the broader market. For more details see: SHOP Operating Income Comparison SHOP has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns.

Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook changes. Review SHOP Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming benchmarks that include all three—S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 27, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that the construction of VENU’s (NYSE American: VENU) $350 million Sunset Amphitheater in McKinney, Texas, is progressing on schedule, marking a major milestone in the company’s mission to redefine the live entertainment landscape through real estate–backed, community-integrated entertainment campuses. The state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat premium amphitheater is projected to begin its inaugural concert season in 2026, which could grow to more than 80 shows annually, in its first full year, featuring premier global talent. Strategically located at the intersection of US 75 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway, the Sunset Amphitheater sits within a 30-minute drive of nearly 4 million residents and just over an hour from almost 10 million people, one of the most lucrative and demographically dynamic catchment zones in the nation. The amphitheater’s 46-acre site is designed to function year-round with a multi-season configuration, hosting 20,000 attendees in warm months, and reconfiguring to seat 5,000 guests in the winter with heated flooring and a partially enclosed roof and wind walls to maintain comfort in colder weather. Key features include: A Model Designed for Scale Drawing on experience from its Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, VENU continues to refine its construction process to deliver on-demand fulfillment of premium entertainment facilities with increased speed and efficiency. This approach underpins the Company’s growing portfolio, now over $5 billion in total pipeline, with $1.3 billion currently under construction across multiple states and 38 municipalities actively negotiating for future campuses. “From day one, we’ve been clear about how we intend to fund expansion — through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks,” said CEO and Chairman J.W. Roth. “Our growth is accelerating faster than we expected, and the foundation we’ve laid is designed for scale.” FireSuites: The Backbone of VENU’s Expansion Central to VENU’s business model are its Luxe FireSuites, real estate–backed, triple-net-leased VIP ownership experiences offering an anticipated 11% cap rate. Each FireSuite accommodates four to ten guests, featuring VIP entry, premium parking, and in-suite hospitality. Sales momentum remains strong: $23 million in FireSuite revenue booked in just 60 days, up 250% year-over-year, with company-wide inventory nearly 49% sold across Tulsa ($80M), McKinney ($147M), and El Paso ($106M). Economic and Institutional Tailwinds According to D Magazine, the McKinney project is expected to generate $3.8 billion in local economic impact over the next decade. The project also benefits from growing institutional confidence, Vanguard Group and 23 other institutions now hold nearly 5% of VENU’s float, signaling market recognition of its scalable, asset-backed model. With strategic partnerships spanning Tixr (ticketing), AEG Presents (touring), Aramark (hospitality), Ryan LLC (PPP structuring), and Sands Investment Group (sales), VENU continues to execute on a low-debt, high-leverage growth model that generates recurring revenue before the first ticket is even sold. Looking Ahead As the live music industry is projected by Goldman Sachs to grow at a 7.2% compound annual rate through 2030, VENU’s focus on premium, flexible, and artist-friendly venues places it at the epicenter of this expansion. The McKinney Sunset Amphitheater is the blueprint for the next era of experiential entertainment.

Wall Street is back in rally mode. The US stock market today is surging as investors cheer signs of a possible Trump-Xi trade deal. Dow futures are up 250 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher — and traders are betting on a major Fed rate cut this week. Markets are now turning their focus to Trump’s high-stakes Asia trip. He’s set to meet China’s President Xi on Thursday, and early talks hint at “a substantial framework” for an agreement, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Across Asia, stocks are exploding higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 smashed through 50,000 for the first time ever. Kospi, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite are all in the green.

Title: You've Been Warned: Consumer Reports Says These Cheap TVs Aren't Worth Your Money

Time Published: 2025-10-26T13:15:00Z

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. If you're on the lookout for cheap TVs, you may want to hold back on buying certain brands and models, lest you risk missing out on getting your money's worth. At least, that's the thought behind a warning from Consumer Reports, which wants customers to avoid spending money on televisions that just aren't worth the investment. Yes, even if they come with a very low price tag. The cost of a new television is often remarkably affordable, regardless of the size and resolution of the product in question. This frequently gets attributed to factors such as decreased public demand and high inventory levels. It's also crucial to note that competition is a factor, and some companies produce good-quality TVs that customers feel are worth the investment. The trick for many shoppers is to figure out which brands those are and what price constitutes a good deal. There are a few cheap TV models that Customer Reports repeatedly warns Americans to avoid, and in some cases, a few companies that the review website suggests shoppers should give serious thought to before considering any of their products. That said, not everyone is so harsh on these low-cost offerings. Some reviewers and customers shared positive experiences and comments. Ultimately, it's best to do your own research concerning product specifications, verified user reviews, and available deals. With these thoughts in mind, here are the budget TVs that Consumer Reports has cautioned customers about purchasing. Vizio's TVs are cheap to purchase, thanks in large part to the company's decision to outsource upwards of 99% of its manufacturing. But while that may give Vizio's bottom line a significant boost, the same can't always be said for the quality of their televisions. That was the case for the M65Q6M-K04 model, a 65-inch 4K UHD smart TV, which Consumer Reports warned suffers from deficient contrast, which negatively affects the product's image quality. While some customers were pleased with the LED picture quality relative to the pricing, some customers experienced bizarre glitches, such as horizontal lines, despite their television being relatively new. One buyer complained the M65Q6M-K04 "wouldn't hold a sync." Meanwhile, one perplexed customer said the TV would sometimes turn on by itself. The Vizio M65Q6M-K04 received decent marks from RTINGS for its low input lag, VRR support, and decent response time when gaming. However, the same review found the product to offer a bland viewing experience when watching sports, TV shows, and movies; it could work as a computer monitor, though RTINGS called out its refresh rate of 60Hz. These TVs are sold for as low as $270. Still, this purchase might not be worth it if you are willing to pay a little more to guarantee excellent video quality. Moreover, you might want to pay careful attention to your warranty should you notice any unusual glitches early on. The Toshiba 75C350KU or 75-Class C350 Series is a prime example of the dip in quality that the brand reportedly suffered following its acquisition from Hisense in November 2017. Though Toshiba was previously known for excellent products, such as the still much-loved Satellite laptops, this was not the case with TVs like the 75C350KU model. Currently, you can buy this item starting at $324.99 through Best Buy or $399 at Amazon; the 65-inch version is more cost-friendly at $325 through Amazon. Despite having a 2160p resolution, Consumer Reports gave these 75-inch televisions low marks for poor image quality and mediocre High Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities. CR weren't alone in their observation, with reviewers from RTINGS.com and PC Mag also calling out issues with the model. For instance, RTINGS shared that the 2023 release had "low peak brightness in SDR and HDR," and "noticeably darker edges on bright scenes of uniform color." Even with such negative reviews, not everything about the 75-Class C350 Series gets discussed negatively. In addition to Amazon Alexa voice control, the Toshiba TV also featured low input lag, an invaluable feature for dedicated gamers. While the cheap price tag and big screen size might make this model seem worth the price, it might be a good idea to compare its specs to similarly sized and priced models from rival brands. RCA is another once-popular brand that Consumer Reports mentioned as having seen better days. As CR notes, RCA was actually responsible for helping to establish the NTSC standards for color television. Yet, things are much different in the 21st century, and this brand is no longer near the top of the pecking order when it comes to TV viewing experience. This is reflected in the reception of the RCA RNSMU6036, a 60-inch LCD 4K UHD TV. In reviewing the TV, Consumer Reports stated that the "HD picture quality falls short," and "near-white highlights are overly peaked, and contrasty." CR also found that the HDR performance was insufficient. "When playing HDR content, the TV does not trigger new picture settings that are optimized for HDR." Although certain audio and visual specs weren't necessarily up to par, CR did give the product credit for having good motion performance, despite lacking a blur reduction feature. This model isn't readily in stock, though in the past it's reportedly been sold for around $300. If you come across this RCA TV for sale, likely at a discount, you might be able to get it even cheaper. However, the scarcity of this product may signal that it's better to find a more positively reviewed alternative that is readily in stock. Westinghouse TVs are often very cheap to buy, and the 24-inch WD24HX1201 is no exception. However, Consumer Reports doesn't think too much of the brand in terms of overall quality. In an article critiquing specific brands, CR acknowledged Westinghouse as a "historic U.S. electronics name" under the ownership of ViacomCBS. Per Consumer Reports, the brand's television sets are licensed through a Chinese company named TongFang, which manufactures Westinghouse TVs through a California factory. Sometimes, customers will see a name and be unaware of any changes that CR warns could impact the actual end product that makes it to market. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is extremely cost-friendly, having gone for as low as $51.99 through some retailers. Its small size also makes it ideal for spaces where owning a huge smart HD TV just isn't practical, such as a tiny studio apartment or college dorm room. Despite its convenient size and pricing, some notable issues might be hard to overlook. For instance, while some viewers are pleased with the viewing experience, others reportedly believe the product does not meet full HD standards comparable to other models currently available. Meanwhile, one customer complained that the "sound is terrible," describing it as "tinny" in nature. While CR and similar review sites believe Westinghouse's quality is compromised, the customer will ultimately have the final say regarding experience and value for money. If you prioritize size, convenience, and pricing over quality, this model could be worth it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere for a better-quality TV. In Consumer Reports' breakdown of the 55-inch Vizio M65Q6-L4, the reviewer deemed the HDR performance to be largely "ineffective," stating, "In our tests, the display did not have the peak brightness capability necessary (by HDR standards) to reproduce the extended contrast on our HDR content." Unfortunately, this isn't the only area where CR felt the product fell short, as the reviewer noted that contrast was bad during dark scenes, which made the image appear "flat with no sense of depth." Visual experience aside, Consumer Reports did give the model positive marks for motion blur performance. They also found the TV's sound quality to be about average compared to similar products. The Vizio M65Q6-L4, also known as the Vizio Quantum QLED, was first released in 2023, but since then, review sites like CR and RTINGS have ultimately deemed it to be a mediocre product. RTINGS gave it a 6.5 out of 10 score, noting that the product is highly suitable for use as a PC monitor, but is only a fair to average option for watching TV shows, movies, or gaming. RTINGS did side with Consumer Reports regarding the TV's inferior HDR capabilities, while also mentioning its subpar selection of streaming applications. Despite such criticisms, the Vizio M65Q6-L4 is relatively cheap to buy, priced at $378 on Walmart's website. Whether this purchase will be worth it ultimately comes down to your budget and needs, but for the price, there's a good chance you can find a better bargain. If you were hoping to recommend the Vizio V555-J01 as an alternative to the poorly received M65Q6-L4, then Consumer Reports' review of this particular model could give you pause. Part of the V5 series of Vizio smart TVs, this product unfortunately has similar design issues to the Quantum QLED. For example, CR found it to have poor HDR performance with flat screen imagery. However, the V555-J01 model also has some sound quality issues. Consumer Reports said the audio performance might work for typical television viewing, but that "its shortcomings would be obvious with movie soundtracks and music." Even with the warnings from review sites like CR, some customers found the Vizeo TV to be worth the purchase. The product is currently selling at $311.99 at Best Buy, where customers rate the model 4.4 out of 5. Satisfied buyers reportedly love the price and the ease of setup. Interestingly, most customers outright disagreed with Consumer Reports' take on the image quality, finding it to be very good. This reception could of course be tied to perceived value for money and what many purchasers expect for the related price tag. This is likely going to be a situation where your desire for a bargain will impact your perception of a brand and its products. Vizio has established itself as a brand that sells very affordable TVs. If you prefer cheap TVs, you may be satisfied here. That said, if you are seeking better reviewed TVs with higher end specifications, you will likely want to try a different brand and TV model. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is a 24-inch model with a 768p resolution that ultimately left a lot to be desired. According to Consumer Reports, the TV has only a single HDMI and USB port, which is notable since smaller laptops often come with more USB ports. If the connection options leave you unimpressed, the viewing experience might not be much better. CR felt the color accuracy was below the quality demonstrated by rival brands, and that the "black levels were merely okay." Contrast was also below standards compared to the results found testing similar TVs. Lastly, Consumer Reports found the model to have a narrow viewing angle that offered a "below average performance" relative to other televisions. Although Consumer Reports finds the Westinghouse brand to be lacking compared to top TV brands, customers are willing to overlook quality issues and have given the TV positive feedback on the official website. They not only uploaded images of their TVs, but also repeatedly praised the model for being easy to set up and use. There were also repeated mentions of how satisfied they were with the product for the purchase price. Similar sentiments were expressed by customers who bought the television through Best Buy. While availability can vary, the WD24HX1201 model can be found for sale starting at $115.99 on websites like Walmart and Amazon. As was the case with Vizio, it may be that Westinghouse is a brand that consumers associate with bargain shopping, and so aren't going to hold it to the rigorous standards applied by Consumer Reports. That said, quality-minded shoppers will probably heed CR's warning and pass on this Westinghouse product. Consumer Reports isn't impressed with RCA, despite many of its TVs being affordably priced. Although the site has not directly reviewed the 50-inch RLDED5098-UHD model, CR's past warnings about RCA's brand and related quality appear to reflect how purchasers have come to see this television. For example, over 2,000 Walmart customers gave the TV an overall rating of 3.7 out of 5. Some customers were highly unsatisfied with the 2160p LED TV, opting to leave scathing 2- and 1-star reviews. Some purchasers complained about sound quality. A reviewer named Patricia, who left a 2-star review, claimed that the audio "was going in and out." Other 2-star reviewers complained about the difficulty in picking up channels and found the accompanying remote to be too small. Other notable reviews mentioned a terrible "burning" smell. More than half of the reviews for the RLDED5098-UHD were ultimately quite positive, with many bringing up the low price as a plus. That aside, the complaints about various shortcomings strongly reflect overall quality issues that Consumer Reports has mentioned that some brands like RCA struggle with, especially as ownership of the brand name has passed to companies that do not consistently produce top quality TVs.

Title: S&P 500 Surges: Magnificent 7 Earnings, Rate Cut, And AI Boom Drive Q3

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Title: Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are slapping 'golden handcuffs' on workers to meet demand for the AI boom

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to
