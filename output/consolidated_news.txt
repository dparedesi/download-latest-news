Over 700 members of National Security Leaders for America (NSL4A) signed a letter endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris last week, but many of the officials are aligned with defense contractors and organizations pushing for U.S. involvement in foreign conflict. Some of the officials voted for the U.S. invasion of Iraq ‚Äì including former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton ‚Äì which amounted to a nearly $140 billion boon to private contractors, according to CNN. In addition to bureaucrats and veterans of the intelligence community, the list features numerous individuals affiliated with defense contractors, government-funded think tanks, and organizations partnered with arms manufacturers. The letter asserts Harris will defend democracy while former President Donald Trump will enable authoritarianism, touting her support for Ukraine. Harris recently toured a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The letter does not mention that Russia invaded Ukraine during the Biden-Harris administration.

For example, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson serves on the board of directors of Lockheed Martin, according to the company‚Äôs site. NSL4A member Rear Admiral John D. Butler spent a decade at Lockheed Martin, including as Vice President for Naval Strategic Systems, according to his bio at University of Texas at Austin. Former Acting Secretary of the Navy, Buddie J. Penn, worked for Loral Federal Systems, which was acquired by Lockheed Martin in the late nineties, the Naval Historical Foundation states in his biography.

Former CIA director and Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Deutch, served as director of Raytheon, according to the EFI Foundation. Former National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director, Letitia A. Long, was elected to Raytheon‚Äôs Board of Directors in 2015, according to PR Newswire (although she is not presently listed on Raytheon‚Äôs site). Brett B. Lambert, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, served as Vice President of Corporate Strategy for the defense contractor from 2015-2019, according to Stimson. (RELATED: Biden Pentagon Rolls Out $1.7 Billion Arms Package To Ukraine) If the endorsers are not directly tied to the arms industry, some are involved in organizations supported by major defense contractors ‚Äî notably, think tanks that influence U.S. national security and foreign policy. Over 50 of those who signed the letter are members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which publishes Foreign Affairs and is a heavyweight in the D.C. influence industry. CFR is partnered with various companies, from Blackrock to defense contractors. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are listed as Bronze level members of the Council. A Bronze corporate membership is at least $50,000, according to CFR. Members include former Secretary of Homeland Security and Democratic Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, as well as former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations, Catherine Bertini. The next president will face serious foreign policy challenges.

NSL4A member and former Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat is listed as a lifetime director for the Council, according to its website. In 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation and General Atomics both contributed at least $250,000, according to its 2022-2023 annual report. The Council also received over $1 million in contributions each from the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of State in 2022. Notably, the Atlantic Council‚Äôs Scowcroft Center ‚Äúdirectly shaped key US and allied strategy documents, including through private meetings with senior officials on the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and NATO‚Äôs Strategic Concept,‚Äù according to its report. Multiple members of NSL4A ‚Äì including John Kerry ‚Äì are also affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That group received funding from The Boeing Company, according to its 2023 annual report. Additionally, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations ‚Äì the latter founded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ‚Äì contributed to the organization. (RELATED: Trump Pledges To ‚ÄòBring Peace To The World‚Äô After ‚ÄòVery Good‚Äô Phone Call With Zelensky) Around a dozen officials are connected to the military think tank the RAND corporation. RAND is funded by the U.S. government, according to USA spending. Over half of its nearly $200 million in government funding this past year came from the DOD, according to the database. Former Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig is listed as a member of RAND‚Äôs Board of Trustees, along with Chuck Hagel, according to RAND‚Äôs site. A member of NSL4A‚Äôs steering committee, former Ambassador Jeff Bleich, serves on the board of RAND Australia, according to RAND. Last year, RAND published a report detailing the potential consequences of prolonging the Ukraine-Russia conflict. However, two RAND directors later wrote an article in Foreign Policy advising against a peace deal with Russia.

The group‚Äôs president, Rear Admiral Michael E. Smith, founded National Security Leaders for Biden, according to the NSL4A site. Obama administration officials including former Ambassador Susan Rice and former national security advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes also signed the letter. There are at least 68 members who served in the intelligence community. Democrats overwhelmingly have a positive view of intelligence agencies while Republicans are increasingly skeptical, according to a Gallup poll.

Notably, Brennan previously signed a letter that characterized the New York Post story on Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop as ‚ÄúRussian disinformation.‚Äù The Post‚Äôs story was verifiably true, as the Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed. Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper and Senior Counselor at Palantir Technologies Wendy R. Anderson are listed among the members. Palantir is partly funded by the CIA, according to Reuters. Former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, although not on the list, also endorsed Harris.

Title: Bitcoin: THIS key level hints at BTC‚Äôs next bull run

Time Published: 2024-09-30T22:00:54Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price performance has been quite bullish. Here is a key metric to track further bullish momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] has recently shown signs of stabilization above the $64,000 mark, although it initially surged to $66,000 in the early hours of the 30th of September. Since then, a correction has brought the asset down to $64,633, marking a slight 1.4% decline. Despite this short-term dip, a broader view reveals Bitcoin‚Äôs growth, with the asset up by 10.2% over the past two weeks. However, the question remains: when will Bitcoin start the bull run that many experts predict could push its price into six figures? To provide clarity for investors, CryptoQuant, an on-chain data provider, has shared critical metrics for tracking Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish momentum. The platform published a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) aimed at helping investors understand where Bitcoin might be headed. They noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs strong momentum over the past three weeks‚Äîrising over 23% from $52,500 to above $65,000‚Äîhas been partly fueled by increased demand for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Notably, combined inflows from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark totaled $324 million on the 26th of September, signaling heightened interest from U.S. investors. Source: CryptoQuant According to CryptoQuant, one of the key drivers for Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally is the resurgence of short-term holders back into profit territory. These holders, defined as investors who have moved their Bitcoin within the last 155 days, have an average purchase price of around $63,000. As Bitcoin‚Äôs price hovers above this level, it could act as a strong support level, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Source: CryptoQuant The futures market also offers significant insights into Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends. CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs Open Interest was $19.1 billion at press time. Historically, surges past $18.0 billion have led to price corrections. Source: CryptoQuant This marks the seventh time such a threshold has been crossed since March 2024, prompting caution around the possibility of a short-term dip. Despite this, the overall trend of increasing futures activity reflects growing investor confidence. Another notable development is the transformation of spot Bitcoin ETF holdings into long-term holder supply. As coins surpass the 155-day holding period, they are increasingly categorized as part of the long-term supply. Source: CryptoQuant While this shift might suggest a bullish outlook, CryptoQuant warns that such movements are often observed in the later stages of a bull market, indicating potential market maturity or a transition phase in Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. Beyond the fundamental metrics, several analysts have shared their perspectives on where Bitcoin could head next. Javon Marks, a prominent crypto analyst, suggested that Bitcoin was nearing a critical resistance level defined by a ‚Äúdescending broadening wedge‚Äù pattern. Source: Javon Marks/X According to Marks, a bullish breakout past this resistance could propel Bitcoin to a target range of $99,000 to $100,000, an increase of over 51% from its current price. His outlook emphasized that Bitcoin may be gearing up for a significant move in the coming weeks. Similarly, another analyst, Captain Faibik, noted that Bitcoin bulls currently hold a strong position in the market. Read Bitcoin‚Äôs [BTC] Price Prediction 2024‚Äì2025 With Bitcoin approaching a crucial resistance level of $68,000, Faibik speculated that a successful breakout from the broadening wedge could see the cryptocurrency reach $88,000 to $90,000 by the end of December. However, he also cautions that failure to break through this resistance, or a potential fake-out, could see Bitcoin retest support zones around $57,000.

Title: SoftBank to Invest $500M in OpenAI for the First Time‚ÄîIs It Late to the Party?

Time Published: 2024-09-30T21:48:36Z

SoftBank (SFTBF) is looking to invest in OpenAI for the first time. The Japanese conglomerate helmed by billionaire Masayoshi Son has reportedly agreed to chip in $500 million via its second Vision Fund in a round that values the ChatGPT maker at a staggering $150 billion, The Information reported today (Sept. 30). The round is set to be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing $1 billion. Other participants could include Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tiger Global Management and the United Arab Emirates-backed fund MGX. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. SoftBank‚Äôs involvement would represent one of Son‚Äôs most significant bets on A.I. so far. It would also follow missteps made by the conglomerate‚Äôs first Vision Fund, which infamously backed WeWork and suffered heavy losses after its collapse in 2023. Until now, Son‚Äôs most notable A.I. investment has been SoftBank‚Äôs majority ownership of Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer. SoftBank in May reported a $4.6 billion gain for its Vision Funds for the fiscal year, largely driven by Arm‚Äôs 2023 IPO. In the past few years, the conglomerate has been on ‚Äúdefense mode,‚Äù said Son during SoftBank‚Äôs 2023 annual shareholder meeting last June. ‚ÄúThree years ago, we didn‚Äôt have a lot of cash on hand,‚Äù said Son at the time, noting that SoftBank has since amassed more than $35 billion. ‚ÄúWe are ready to shift to offense mode,‚Äù he declared, adding his primary interest was playing a large role in the ‚ÄúA.I. revolution.‚Äù Besides partaking in an investment round for Perplexity AI, an A.I.-driven search engine, earlier this year, the company has largely taken a backseat to A.I. startups and reportedly passed on investments in OpenAI competitors like Mistral AI, Anthropic and Cohere. Its willingness to back OpenAI, however, should come as no surprise‚ÄîSon has repeatedly sung the praises of the company, stating that he is a ‚Äúheavy user of ChatGPT‚Äù and calling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ‚Äúone of the key people on Earth.‚Äù SoftBank and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment from Observer regarding SoftBank‚Äôs investment. SoftBank‚Äôs bet on OpenAI is quite late by venture capital standards, given its already colossal valuation. But the high-flying A.I. company still has room for growth, according to analysts. The company hit $3.4 billion in annualized revenue in June and is ‚Äúprogressing towards $5 billion in annual recurring revenue, driven primarily by its ChatGPT product,‚Äù Brendan Burke, PitchBook‚Äôs senior emerging technology analyst, told Observer via email. PitchBook estimates OpenAI is set to benefit from a generative A.I. software market that is on pace to double next year and exceed $30 billion, he added. ‚ÄúThis revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believed the company can grow into,‚Äù said Burke. SoftBank‚Äôs investment comes at a time of uncertainty for OpenAI. The company last week lost three top executives, and Altman is reportedly planning a restructuring that will change the company‚Äôs capped-profit model. ‚ÄúLeadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding,‚Äù said Altman in a post on X announcing the recent departures.

Title: How Meta‚Äôs Metaverse Bet Went From Awkward to¬†Wow

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily With Meta‚Äôs Orion AR glasses, photorealistic virtual spaces and Puma‚Äôs mixed-reality shopping, fashion has a lot to ponder. Tech Reporter All of a sudden, virtual technology seems less like a fading fad and more like a viable wave of the future ‚Äî and Meta, keeper of chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs metaverse dreams, must be thrilled. The major takeaway from the Meta Connect developer conference last week was that the company finally succeeded in building full holographic, augmented reality glasses, or at least a prototype. Though early, the implications matter because, as Zuckerberg sees it, this is the technology that will someday replace smartphones. But that just scratches the surface, especially for the fashion business. Because Meta also unleashed a slew of new reality-bending features and experiences that could change how brands operate and communicate in the near, not far-off, future. Related Articles Beauty Features Marla Beck on Her Plans for Hydrafacial Parent Company BeautyHealth Technology Online Returns Reduced With AI-powered Virtual Fitting Room Holographic AR Glasses You May Also Like Seven months after Apple launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, the Meta CEO surprised the crowd by showing off the Orion prototype. Forget bulky and heavy headsets, or holding up a smartphone screen. For Meta, stepping into an AR or MR experience will be a matter of putting on a pair of spectacles. This was always the goal of its EssilorLuxottica partnership. First, they created the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which continue to get smarter with evolving artificial intelligence features and expanded styles and colors, including a new transparent frame. Lessons learned along the way were then applied to the Ray-Ban‚Äôs bigger, techier cousin. And Orion is just that. The prototype is set in a thicker frame with beefier specs, including projection technology that can beam interactive visuals onto the lenses. It also features AI-powered voice control, eye- and hand-tracking ‚Äî so users can select elements by reaching for or looking at them ‚Äî as well as a wrist-based neural interface. Imagine designers collaborating on a new capsule collection using AR or MR, conceptualizing ideas together or tweaking virtual pieces in real time. With gestures, they can easily switch colors, bring up the hemline, add embellishments and do other things, and visually see the work progress ‚Äî as if the item was physically on the table between them. Extend that to shopping, and it gives a whole new meaning to browsing products. Meta embarked on the Luxottica partnership four years ago, but the effort to build full-fledged holographic AR glasses goes back further. It started with the 2014 acquisition of virtual reality developer Oculus, which eventually became Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs division. So Zuckerberg has been talking about virtual experiences for 10 years, and specifically glasses-based AR for four years. Now with a tangible prototype ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt Meta‚Äôs first, but it‚Äôs the first to be showcased publicly ‚Äî the vision looks more than just feasible. It is actually on the way. ‚ÄúSo with Orion we are getting closer to achieving the dream of Reality Labs, to create the next major computing platform that delivers a deep sense of presence ‚Äî like you were right there with another person,‚Äù Zuckerberg explained. ‚ÄúThis is where we are going.‚Äù The big reveal set off plenty of buzz in tech circles, but analysts seem mixed. While some are skeptical, others are so impressed, they actively wonder why the CEO started off by talking about Meta Quest, Ray-Ban and Meta AI updates instead of Orion. The answer should be obvious. This is Zuckerberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne more thing‚Äù moment, echoing Steve Jobs‚Äô penchant for saving the most exciting Apple debuts for last. Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post, who put a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating on Meta stock, told clients that interest will swirl around Orion more than the Quest headset. Perhaps someday. But for now, the Quest is an actual product circulating in the market, which is why the next item may be more immediately gratifying. Fashion, Meet Hyperscape According to Counterpoint Research, Meta already accounts for 74 percent of the global VR and AR market, as of the second quarter of 2024, and with a new budget headset, the Quest 3S, that number could jump even further. A cheaper device will surely please some consumers, but brands may be more intrigued by the new photorealistic avatars and environments coming to this and other models. ‚ÄúWe call this Hyperscape,‚Äù said Zuckerberg, ‚Äúand the way this works is, you can use your phone to scan a room and then recreate it, or you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.‚Äù He then showcased visual artist Daniel Arsham‚Äôs studio in New York and an L.A. music studio used by Green Day. More will be available in the Horizon Hyperscape beta app over time, he added. The potential for photo shoots or runway scenes that are never broken down, but virtually memorialized jumps to mind. Brands could also give customers access to behind-the-scenes spaces, as a way to forge a personal connection. Rise of the Visual D√∂ppelbots Another fascinating tidbit is a new Meta AI power, specifically AI Studio. The set of tools gives creators a new capability to create AIs that can interact with their communities on social media. In a demo, creator and author Don Allen Stevenson III showed an AI version of himself that he trained to respond to frequently asked questions, just as he himself would respond to fans. This is essentially a visual bot ‚Äî perhaps a d√∂ppelbot ‚Äî that looked and spoke like him. Meant to be helpful, this one can get creepy. But if curated and trained well, it might be a novel way for a renowned designer to offer some face time with fans, clients and others without the time drain. For users, real-time styling advice will now be possible using the Ray-Ban smartglasses, thanks to multimodal video AI. ‚ÄúMeta AI is now going to be able to give you real-time help as you are doing things, like trying to figure out what outfit you want to wear to a party that you‚Äôre going to,‚Äù said Zuckerberg. For example, if a person sifts through various clothes to weigh options, the camera on the smart Ray-Bans can see them too, recommending that dress on the right or remembering something it saw earlier. Meta AI can even give that advice in some familiar voices, including John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan Michael Key or Awkwafina. Learn a Second Language ‚Äî Fast Another new Threads feature uses AI to power real-time language translation dubbing with automatic lip syncing. So forget captions or dubbed voiceovers. A video by a Spanish speaker could be viewed in English, or vice versa, as if the spokesperson, model or other personality is actually speaking the other language. International or multiregion brands, take note. Meta‚Äôs Puma Collab Brings Mixed-reality Shopping Unlike the others, Meta‚Äôs Puma collaboration wasn‚Äôt part of the keynote. But it should have been. During the conference, Meta‚Äôs Web Platform Team teased ‚Äúthe future of e-commerce‚Äù through a new web-based extended reality shopping scenario. Extended reality, or XR, is a blanket term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). The Puma shopping experience works as a virtual overlay of product on the headset‚Äôs camera pass-through view. But it‚Äôs not a lean-back proposition. Shoppers can swipe to change the item‚Äôs color, and ‚Äúexperience how each colorway transforms the environment around them,‚Äù according to a representative. Every design will come with a unique atmosphere. The experience will officially roll out for Quest users this fall. However, it looks like a better fit for Orion. There‚Äôs a sense of separation in seeing the world through the headset‚Äôs live camera feed, whereas eyeglasses offer a direct view of reality. In other words, there‚Äôs nothing to stand between the consumer and the product. ‚ÄúA lot of the stuff we‚Äôve been talking about for a long time ‚Ä¶ glasses, mixed reality, AI ‚Äî it‚Äôs happening,‚Äù Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect. ‚ÄúAnd you know, we can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look and it‚Äôs pretty awesome.‚Äù Analysts apparently need more convincing, at least when it comes to Orion. Martin Yang, of Oppenheimer, told clients in a note that Orion is no Apple Vision Pro killer, citing cost. There‚Äôs no ship date or retail price announced yet ‚Äî again, because it‚Äôs a prototype ‚Äî but it will likely top the rival device‚Äôs $3,500. Some estimates say Orion costs $10,000 or more to build. Yang still called it ‚Äúimpressive,‚Äù given that ‚Äúmost other AR glasses on the market, despite heavier designs, have much narrower FOVs [fields of view] of 40-50 degrees,‚Äù he said. Post, of Bank of America, believes Orion is ‚Äúseveral years (and tens of billions) away from general release.‚Äù In the meantime, Meta is giving creators and brands plenty of other tools to play with.

Hello, Memo readers! AI is gaining some fans in a place where many also fear it: the office. People who use AI in the office seem to have a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù relationship with their work, compared to those who don‚Äôt use AI at all, according to a survey of 15,600 workers commissioned by HP (who‚Äôs hardware and software is increasingly being infused with AI). ‚ÄúKnowledge workers who use AI are +11-points happier with their relationship with work than their colleagues who don‚Äôt,‚Äù HP said in its latest Work Relationship Index report. The study also found that 90% of surveyed AI users say the tools have helped them save more time, 85% say the tools helped them dedicate more time to important and timely tasks, 84% reported that AI helped them be more creative, while 83% said such services helped them to find pleasure in their work. But while some employees use AI tools to improve their work lives, many are concerned about the downsides of the rise of workplace AI, including its role in layoffs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good warning that with more automation and decision support tools, less human interactions will be necessary,‚Äù said Christoph Wollersheim, consultant at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder. ‚ÄúThere are great benefits that will come with the automation, but also risks that personal relationships will suffer or will get replaced by AI,‚Äù he told Quartz. Read the full article here. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is creating technology likely to upend humans‚Äô relationship with the written word. But when Altman needs to keep his thoughts organized, he still relies on pen and paper. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs all these like fancy notebooks in the world. You don‚Äôt want those. You definitely want a spiral notebook because one thing that‚Äôs important is you can rip pages out frequently, and you also want it to lie, like, flat and open on the table,‚Äù Altman said on the ‚ÄúHow I Write‚Äù podcast hosted by David Perell.

By Laura Matthews, Suzanne McGee NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Texas Stock Exchange announced a board of directors on Monday in its latest step toward building a national exchange to rival long-established platforms in New York and said it was gearing up to launch trading next year. TXSE announced in June that it plans to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with backing from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Citadel Securities. It said on Monday it had secured $135 million. The exchange also said on Monday that Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas and former U.S. energy secretary, will be a board member. Other directors include Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner, and Alex Bussandri, global head of strategy at Citadel Securities. The exchange has also drawn staff members from Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, a division of the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), as well as other trading platforms, it said on Monday. "Texas Stock Exchange is pulling big names in preparation for the potential launch in 2025," said Owen Lau, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, noting that the space is competitive. Nasdaq announced last week it put in place a regional management structure for its global listings franchise and appointed Texas-native Rachel Racz, as head of listings for Texas, Southern U.S. and Latin America. It didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. James Lee, founder and chief executive of TXSE Group Inc, said the exchange plans to submit a SEC registration in the coming months. After approval, he added that TXSE will execute its first trades by the end of 2025 and launch its listing early in 2026, making Dallas "a new hub for capital markets in the United States". Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday that the exchange will ensure that businesses have access to capital and that market participants have more choice. The exchange also named Cam Smith as its global head of trading and co-president. Smith began his career working for electronic trading platforms and served as president of Quantlab, an automated proprietary trading firm. Jeff Brown, a former acting general counsel at Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), is serving as general counsel of TXSE Group Inc and chief regulatory officer of the exchange. Nicole Chambers, who handled the Texas market for Nasdaq, will run corporate listings. Jeff Karcher and Marc Cunningham, who covered the southeast U.S. and Texas while working at the NYSE, will serve as global managing director.

Title: Ever Lose Track of Time in a Costco? You're Not Alone

Not only does Costco Wholesale (COST) do a good job of getting its 76 million members in the door‚Äîbut, according to a new report, manages to keep them there, too. The average Costco visit lasted 37.3 minutes for U.S. customers in the first half of 2024, according to a Monday report from Emarketer citing data from Placer.ai. That‚Äôs more than Walmart (WMT) (31.8 minutes) and Target (TGT) (28.7 minutes), according to the report. Costco is also the only one of the three to see its average "dwell time" for customers staying in-store increase from the first half of 2021 to the same period this year. One likely reason for the extended stays is that Costco frequently changes its layout, creating a "treasure hunt" experience for customers. The membership-based retailer isn‚Äôt alone in changing things up, but it is notorious for rotating its stock of items. In general, grocery stores are often known to stock essentials, like bread, milk, and eggs near the back of the store so customers have to walk all the way through to find them. Costco had 76 million members at the end of its most recent quarter, but starting Sept. 1 those members are paying more. After the retailer raised its membership price for the first time in seven years, executives said on an earnings call last week that they haven't seen any meaningful changes to renewal trends in the first month.

Stocks defied the odds in September, ticking up to trade at record highs despite the month's reputation as a notoriously rough patch for equities. The S&P 500 rose 5.5% in the third quarter, putting the index up nearly 21% in the first three quarters, its best year-to-date performance of the 21st century. But it was a tumultuous three months. In July and August, stocks recorded some of their best and worst days in years as investors grappled with recession fears and uncertainty about interest rates. Equities were given a lift in September by the Federal Reserve, which joined the ranks of global central banks easing monetary policy when it cut interest rates‚Äîby 50 basis points‚Äîfor the first time in four years. The cut, according to officials, was a preemptive step to support the labor market, which data suggests is cooling but not falling apart. The fourth quarter is historically a strong one for stocks, and analysts‚Äîdespite noting the likelihood of elevated volatility‚Äîare broadly optimistic about the outlook. As in the third quarter, the economy is likely to be top of mind for investors throughout the fourth quarter. Wall Street will especially be looking at labor market data for evidence of deterioration that would worry the Fed. Initial unemployment claims will be a key data point to keep an eye on, according to analysts at Russell Investments. Claims data, which is released weekly, has less of a lag than other labor market data. "These will provide the clearest real-time guidance on whether the U.S. economy is rebalancing or drifting towards recession," they say. Initial claims sustainably above 260,000 per week would be a red flag, in their view. The four-week average as of late September stood at about 225,000. Fed officials, in their most recent economic projections, penciled in another half-percentage-point cut from interest rates this year. An uptick in unemployment coupled with job losses could spur the Fed into more aggressive action at one of its two policy meetings. That would bring interest rates more in line with market expectations, but would likely also spook investors and do some damage to stock portfolios. The consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed is likely on track to achieve the soft landing it's been chasing for years, which bodes well for stocks. As of late September, the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow calculator estimated the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter. Six of the last 10 rate-cutting cycles coincided with recessions. In those instances, the S&P 500 fell on average in the year after the first cut. In the four cycles that coincided with soft landings, the average return was in the high teens. Conventional wisdom says that small-cap stocks should benefit most from interest-rate cuts since they are more likely to have floating-rate debt. However, BlackRock analysts found that large caps have outperformed small caps during rate-cutting cycles since 1984, and that the outperformance is most pronounced outside of recessions. At the sector level, healthcare and consumer staples have performed the best during rate cuts, while communication services and tech have been the worst performers. The S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent Seven, in the second quarter grew aggregate earnings for the first time since 2022. Third-quarter results, which companies will begin reporting in mid-October, are expected to show the profitability gap between tech mega caps and the rest of the market is continuing to narrow. The Mag 7, meanwhile, faces the challenge of convincing Wall Street that their massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off. They struggled to do so over the summer, sparking selloffs that the group has yet to fully rebound from. These stocks could continue to face pressure if their earnings fail to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations. Political developments are likely to amplify stock volatility through the rest of the year, even if they don‚Äôt fundamentally change the economic or business outlook. The presidential election in November is one such event that could deliver Wall Street a short-term shock. BlackRock analysis found that, more often than not, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a presidential election is not indicative of its performance over the next year. Still, the presidential candidates have staked out positions on tariffs and corporate taxes that, if enacted, would surely change the outlook for U.S. businesses. Conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also keep the stock market on edge as long as they threaten to disrupt global trade or roil energy markets. Experts note, however, that volatility is a two-way street that can provide canny investors with opportunities to buy stocks at attractive valuations. Heightened volatility can also turbocharge short-term returns. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has returned 16% on average in the six months after the Cboe Volatility Index has risen to 29 or higher, compared with an average return of 5% in less volatile periods. Update‚ÄîSept. 30, 2024: This story has been updated with the S&P 500's quarterly performance as of the market close on Sept. 30.

Full Content:
In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has recorded a new 52-week low, touching down at $16.8. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn from previous periods, marking a stark contrast to the company's performance over the past year. The digital media measurement and analytics firm has seen its stock value decrease by 39.71% over the last year, underscoring the broader market volatility and sector-specific headwinds that have impacted investor sentiment towards DoubleVerify. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for investors monitoring the company's trajectory in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, spurred by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also reported an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA. Notably, Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity revised their stock price targets for DoubleVerify, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition to financial outcomes, DoubleVerify introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), a tool designed to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This initiative is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. DoubleVerify has also established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. The company's growth strategies were highlighted during investor meetings, including expansion into social media properties, adoption of new pre-bid optimization products, and scaling in international markets. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent 52-week low of $16.8 aligns with InvestingPro data showing the stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -51.19%. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation amidst market challenges. Additionally, the company boasts impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. While the stock is trading near its 52-week low, it's worth noting that DoubleVerify's P/E ratio is 47.09, suggesting it's still trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its current market position. This valuation metric, combined with the company's strong gross margins and cash position, presents a complex picture for investors to consider. For those seeking a deeper understanding of DoubleVerify's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a more comprehensive analysis to inform investment decisions in these volatile times.

Title: Netflix Cancellations Nearly Tripled After Chairman Reed Hastings Endorsed Kamala Harris

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix chairman Reed Hastings believes Kamala Harris will be good for America ‚Äî even if his support for her may not be good for Netflix. Days after Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix and former co-CEO, endorsed Harris for president, Netflix had its most cancellations in a year, according to Antenna data. From July 25 through July 29, Netflix‚Äôs average daily cancels increased by 2.7x compared to the prior two weeks, the streaming-measurement company found. July 26 was Netflix‚Äôs biggest day for churn in the past year. After July 29, Netflix‚Äôs churn levels returned back to normal and have not elevated since. All told, July‚Äôs churn of 2.8 percent was elevated versus both June (1.8 percent) and August (2.0 percent). Related Stories ‚ÄòJailbreak: Love on the Run‚Äô Wins Battle of Netflix Docs; ‚ÄòIt Ends with Us‚Äô Tops VOD ‚ÄòNo Good Deed‚Äô Teaser: Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano Lead All-Star Cast in New Netflix Mystery Series Bloomberg first reported the news of the temporary churn uptick. Hastings‚Äô support came via a post on X a bit after midnight on July 23. All Hastings tweeted was ‚ÄúCongrats to Kamala Harris ‚Äî now it is time to win.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt take more than that for the cancellations to come pouring in. Congrats to Kamala Harris ‚Äî now it is time to win Hastings did do more than tweet though. He later donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris‚Äô run for president, the Republican Accountability PAC. Hastings said it is the most he‚Äôs ever donated to a single candidate. A spokesperson for Netflix did not immediately respond to IndieWire‚Äôs request for comment on the Antenna findings. We suspect Netflix will be OK. As of June 30, 2024, Netflix had 277.65 million global paid subscribers. These days, the streamer is making nearly $10 billion in revenue each quarter ‚Äî with more than $2 billion in profit ‚Äî and its stock price is over $700 per share. Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) shares had fallen below $200 in 2022 after the company shocked the streaming world with back-to-back quarterly losses. Coincidentally, September 30 is the final day of the third quarter of 2024, which we colloquially refer to as the summer quarter. Netflix will announce the results from July-September on Thursday, October 17, 2024 at 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT. Antenna plans to share its own September data on October 20, a spokesperson told IndieWire, give or take a few days. Hastings, who stepped down in January, will watch from afar as co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Sarandos‚Äô own co-CEO Greg Peters, the company‚Äôs CFO Spence Neumann, and its VP of Finance, IR & Corporate Development Spencer Wang present the Q3 results to shareholders and the greater stock market. Netflix is far and away the most impactful streamer in the marketplace; Amazon‚Äôs Prime Video and the Disney Bundle are its only real competitors. Election Day is November 5.

Title: Nuclear Power Won‚Äôt Solve A.I.‚Äôs Energy Problem, Says Hedge Fund Mogul David Tepper

With Big Tech locked in an arms race to become the next dominant A.I. player, companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are heralding nuclear power as a solution to the technology‚Äôs energy problem. But the hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, founder and president of Appaloosa Management, believes nuclear power simply won‚Äôt be enough for A.I.‚Äôs development needs. ‚ÄúSome of these projections are crazy,‚Äù he told CNBC on Sept. 26. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to meet the power needs of what they need for A.I., you‚Äôre going to have to use natural gas,‚Äù he said.

You can opt out anytime. As the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta spend billions of dollars on building data centers to power A.I. models, they have also sought out ways to offset these data centers‚Äô massive energy consumption. Data centers are expected to double their energy use by the end of the decade and take up 9 percent of the power supply in the U.S., according to the Electric Power Institute. Nuclear power, including the revival of dormant nuclear plants, has emerged as a way to pursue these ambitions without increasing carbon emissions. Microsoft earlier this month signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, the owner of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Three Mile Island plant and the site of a 1979 partial reactor meltdown, in a deal that will reopen one of the site‚Äôs two units. And in March, Amazon Web Services struck a $650 million deal with the energy company Talen Energy to acquire a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania. Despite the tech world‚Äôs optimism about nuclear as a carbon-free alternative, Tepper, who is ‚Äúexploring different parts of the energy side of the tech market,‚Äù said there are too many hurdles to cross when it comes to reviving nuclear power. Governors around the country ‚Äúaren‚Äôt going to let their nuclear power come offline‚Äîit‚Äôs not going to happen, it‚Äôs a joke,‚Äù Tepper told CNBC. ‚ÄúIt will never get by these individual [public utility commissions].‚Äù Tepper currently has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion. His hedge fund is one of the most successful in recent history, having gained a total of $35 billion since its inception in 1993 and $2.7 billion in 2023 alone. Tepper is also the owner of the NFL‚Äôs Carolina Panthers team, which he acquired for around $2.2 billion in 2018. Energy consumption isn‚Äôt the only aspect of A.I. that Tepper is unsure about. In June, Tepper unloaded more than 80 percent of his stake in Nvidia (NVDA), the chip maker leading the A.I. boom. The move, which reduced his Nvidia holding to around $85 million, was caused by Tepper‚Äôs belief that the stock ‚Äúwas too high at the time and would come down.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we didn‚Äôt buy it when it came back down,‚Äù he said. While the billionaire said Nvidia is looking great for 2024 and 2025, he‚Äôs less confident about the company‚Äôs prospects‚Äîand the sustainability of current A.I. hype‚Äîin 2026 and 2027. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know how you know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my preferred vehicle versus other things that I have more confidence in.‚Äù We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has executed around ¬£3 billion ($4 billion) of trades in Thames Water‚Äôs bonds in September, as it makes a market between original investors exiting the beleaguered utility and opportunistic players scooping up the debt at a discount. Hedge funds and distressed funds are continuing to bid for the debt of the UK‚Äôs largest water provider, said dealers at the US bank in a note to clients and seen by Bloomberg on Monday. The trading comes as the company has kicked off talks with creditors as it struggles to raise equity. Worries the firm will soon run out of cash led S&P Global Inc. and Moody‚Äôs Ratings to downgrade its Class A debt ‚Äî deemed the safest ‚Äî by five and six notches respectively last week. They also downgraded its riskier Class B debt. ‚ÄúThe Thames structure remains topical at GS as risk continues to change hands post downgrade,‚Äù the bank said in the note. ‚ÄúSelling was initially in Class B debt, but more recently we‚Äôve been sellers of Class A risk as well.‚Äù Buyers are favoring the more illiquid and lower cash price paper, as the market difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated bonds flattens, the note added. Companies with large amounts of debt often have bonds with wildly differing cash prices because notes are issued over multiple years at different points in the rate cycle. Goldman Sachs has also been trading some of Thames‚Äôs bank debt, with ¬£145 million changing hands via its desk since April, according to the note. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. S&P sees a debt restructuring ‚Äî and consequently a default ‚Äî as likely in the coming 12 months. The company has said it does not expect to receive funds in the form of equity ahead of a final determination by regulator Ofwat, expected at the earliest on Dec. 19. Thames has been negotiating with a group of creditors holding ¬£10 billion of the company‚Äôs Class A debt over options to delay a potential liquidity shortfall. The group of creditors ‚Äî including investors from BlackRock Inc. and Elliott Investment Management ‚Äî has been working on its own plan to address the need for new funds and the unsustainable debt pile.

Title: BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes

The asset management behemoth's private markets arm has seen off competition from rival bidders in a deal likely to be worth more than ¬£300m, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 30 September 2024 17:39, UK An arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is closing in on a takeover of a major contractor to Thames Water even as the utility teeters on the brink of collapse. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock's private markets division could strike a deal to acquire Lanes Group, which is based in Leeds, within days. City insiders said that BlackRock had seen off competition from other suitors. It was unclear on Monday how much the asset management behemoth had agreed to pay for Lanes Group, although Sky News reported last month that the contractor was valued at up to ¬£350m. BlackRock has begun to play an increasingly active role as a bidder in processes populated by conventional private equity firms. Lanes Group provides wastewater and drainage services, and generates a significant chunk of its revenues from Thames Water alongside other major water utilities. The industry is under intense pressure from the new Labour government, industry regulator Ofwat and other stakeholders amid public anger over wastage and pollution levels. Thames Water is battling to avoid temporary nationalisation as it faces running out of money within months unless it can raise additional funding. Sky News reported at the weekend that advisers to the utility, which has about 15m customers, have added Carlyle, the private equity firm, to a list of potential rescue investors. Blackrock declined to comment.

Drive business and brand growth with winning media strategies at Mediaweek. Hear from experts at TIME, Peloton, YouTube, Google and more, October 29-30 in New York City. Register. Will it take a maximum effort for Ryan Reynolds to go public? MNTN, the connected TV advertising platform where Reynolds serves as chief creative officer, tapped Morgan Stanley to explore a potential initial public offering, Bloomberg reports. The IPO could take place as soon as early next year, according to Bloomberg, with ongoing discussions being held about matters such as its timing and whether more financial institutions will participate. MNTN provides software that enables brands to create and manage ad campaigns on CTV platforms, highlighted by its MNTN Performance TV platform, a suite of automated optimization technology, measurement, and targeting tools. After collaborating on the first two Deadpool films, Reynolds and George Dewey formed Maximum Effort Marketing in 2018, and its campaigns for another Reynolds venture, Aviation Gin, fueled the agency‚Äôs rise to prominence. In June 2021, MNTN agreed to acquire Maximum Effort, permitting it to retain its identity as a creative agency within the MNTN portfolio, retaining Dewey as Maximum Effort‚Äôs president, and naming Reynolds CCO of MNTN. Dewey told ADWEEK shortly after the deal was announced, ‚ÄúThe biggest benefit is cultural. We wanted to grow, but not in a way where it meant adding layers and pitches and processes that can sometimes take the joy and speed out of marketing.‚Äù The company raised $119 million in a Series D financing round in 2021, according to Bloomberg, co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management & Research. MNTN added three members to its board of directors in March 2023 to help it manage the company‚Äôs growth: retired accountant Joe B. Johnson, Code.org founder and CEO Hadi Partovi, and Deep Sync CEO Grant Ries. Jay Stevens joined the company in June 2023 as general manager, international, after serving as president of omnichannel media buying and media accounting software company Hudson MX.

Full Content:
In recent market activity, Saba Capital Management, L.P., a notable ten percent owner of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), has increased its position in the company through a series of stock purchases. On September 26 and 27, Saba Capital acquired a total of 49,504 shares, with the transaction value amounting to approximately $782,788. The purchases were made at prices ranging from $15.81 to $15.89 per share. Following these transactions, the investment firm now holds a total of 20,653,378 shares in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust. This move by Saba Capital Management demonstrates a growing interest in the health sciences-focused trust, which may be of interest to investors monitoring the sector. Boaz Weinstein, associated with Saba Capital as a ten percent owner, also has a stake in these transactions, aligning with the investment firm's activities. The accumulation of shares by significant owners such as Saba Capital Management often signals a strong belief in the company's future prospects or undervaluation. Investors and market watchers alike may find these purchases noteworthy as they reflect the actions of experienced market participants with substantial knowledge of the company. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, traded on the NYSE under the ticker BMEZ, represents an investment opportunity within the health sciences sector, which continues to garner attention amidst ongoing innovations and developments. The recent share purchases by Saba Capital Management in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) align with some intriguing financial metrics and insights provided by InvestingPro. BMEZ currently boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.4%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BMEZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." This generous dividend policy might be a factor attracting large investors like Saba Capital. The trust's market capitalization stands at $1.69 billion, with a P/E ratio of 25.31. While this P/E ratio might seem elevated, it's important to consider it in the context of the health sciences sector, which often commands higher valuations due to growth potential. Interestingly, BMEZ has shown strong performance over the past year, with a 20.16% price total return. The trust is also trading at 95.96% of its 52-week high, indicating recent strength in its share price. This positive momentum could be another factor influencing Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake. However, investors should note that InvestingPro Tips also highlight some potential concerns. The trust "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors may warrant closer examination by potential investors. For those interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights that could provide a fuller picture of BMEZ's investment potential.

As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok‚Äôs owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it‚Äôs developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei‚Äôs Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei‚Äôs chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance‚Äôs Doubao model, which was released last August. ‚ÄúThe entire premise here is wrong,‚Äù a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. ‚ÄúNo new AI model is being developed.‚Äù Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company‚Äôs Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B ‚Äî China‚Äôs best alternative to Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down. Since the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked on developing its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.

Title: New weight loss drugs could be developed much faster if Roche gets its way

Roche told investors on Monday that it plans to make significant cuts to both the cost and time it takes for it to develop new drugs, including its slate of experimental weight loss and diabetes medications. At an investor event, the Swiss pharma giant announced its goal to reduce the average development costs of launched drugs by 20% and shorten the timeline from early drug discovery to the completion of phase 3 trials by 40% by 2030, according to a presentation posted on the company‚Äôs website. These targets include the company‚Äôs recently acquired weight loss treatments. Roche is one of several pharma companies racing to break up the anti-obesity drug duopoly held by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. The medications work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They were originally used to treat type-2 diabetes, but have become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. The 127-year-old Roche first entered the weight loss drug game earlier this year when it bought Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. The deal included three candidates, CT-996 ‚Äî a daily pill ‚Äî and the weekly injectables CT-388 and CT-868. Roche said on Monday that together the three drugs have the potential to reach more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) in annual sales. In May the company said that patients taking CT-388 lost 18.8% of their weight on average after 24 weeks on the drug in a small clinical trial. As a result, the company said in July that it is fast-tracking the development of its weight loss drug candidates. Its stock has risen over 37% since May.

Time Published: 2024-09-30T14:35:00Z

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to undergo a stock split after the market closes on Monday, aligning itself with other prominent AI-driven companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which also executed stock splits earlier this year. Following the split, the stock will begin trading Tuesday at its adjusted‚Äîand substantially lower‚Äîprice. Shortly after the market opened on Monday morning, Super Micro Computer‚Äôs shares were priced at $426, reflecting a 1.5% increase. Super Micro Computer‚Äôs 10-for-1 stock split is expected to boost demand for the company‚Äôs shares. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price, but the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn‚Äôt affect the company‚Äôs valuation. Super Micro Computer‚Äôs 10-for-1 split means that, for each SMCI share an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia‚Äôs (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including potential sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro‚Äôs stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

Title: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi

Since their approval in January 2024, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been steadily gaining traction in the United States, with the issuers buying hundreds of thousands of BTC as their popularity spread. This has led to a large stash of BTC by these issuers as BlackRock leads the charge. Given their buying spree so far, the number of BTC being held by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been rising and is almost at the 1 million mark, The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a total of 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading back in January 2024. Now, only eight months later, these ETFs have managed to acquire more than 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Combined, this makes the Spot Bitcoin ETFs some of the largest BTC holders. So far, the BlackRock IBIT has been one of the largest buyers of BTC, surpassing even Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, which had a 600,000 BTC head start. Currently, Grayscale holds more than 350,000 BTC, making the firm a top Bitcoin holder. Grayscale is still in second place when it comes to the number of BTC held. However, the Bitcoin fund has recorded more outflows than inflows since January, losing more than half of its stash before the Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. Now, Grayscale holds less than 250,000 BTC after losing more than $20 billion to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs due to their lower fees. Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs such as the Fidelity FBTC and the Ark Invest/21Shares ARKB has reached almost 50,000 BTC. So far, the funds have been able to garner 924,768 BTC, putting their total holdings very close to the 1 million BTC milestone. In total, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs now boast 4.685 of the total Bitcoin supply. The top Bitcoin wallet with the largest BTC holdings still remains the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet with 1.1 million BTC in it. However, this wallet has been long dormant, and often left out of the top Bitcoin wallets list due to its inactivity. According to the BitInfoCharts website, topping the Bitcoin rich list is the Binance old wallet with 248,598 BTC worth over $16.3 billion. Next is the Bitfinex Hack Recovery wallet with 94,643 BTC, with $6.2 billion. The Mt Gox Hack wallet holds 79,957 BTC for the third-largest at $5.2 billion. The wallet holding the BTC confiscated from the Silk Road bust with 69,370 BTC is in fourth position worth $4.56 billion, and the Binance BTCB Reserve wallet has 68,200 BTC in it, worth $4.49 billion.

Title: Five Frugal Things

Full Content:
The Non-Consumer Advocate by Katy on September 30, 2024 ¬∑ 52 comments { 48 comments‚Ä¶ read them below or add one } The last time we ordered Covid tests they never arrived. However, our insurance company allows us to get 8 tests per month from Walgreens or CVS. Hubby got his last week; as there are only two of us in the house I will wait and pick mine up down the line. Reply 90% of the time when I meet up with friends, we go for a walk in our neighborhood, or a hike at the adjoining nature preserve. A free workout + bonus friend time? Sign me up. I did three of those last week, and my steps are also looking great. üòâ 1) Used up absolutely ancient carrots in a crockpot chicken & dumplings recipe (one of my faves). I rinsed the carrots, and they smelled fine, so in they went. I‚Äôm the only soup eater in my house, so I made enough for a couple of meals, & froze the rest in single serving containers for easy lunches. 2) Sold some stuff on eBay & relisted a bike on FB Marketplace. I find bikes bring out the biggest negotiators, and I really dislike that part of selling, so I‚Äôm giving myself a huge pat on the back for getting this listed & dealing with all of the crazy shenanigans. 3) I really wanted a turkey sandwich on sourdough with sharp cheddar. Thought of stopping by a deli when I was out running errands. Instead, I bought everything I needed to make my own at the store. It was about the same for the ingredients as the sandwich, but so far, I‚Äôve made three sandwiches & another grilled cheese for DS17. Cheaper would have been finding something to eat at home, but this was a good compromise. 4) We allow our home to be a study destination for DS17 & his friends, while they are all studying for their AP classes. They love the library, but it closes early some days. By studying at our house, they avoid having to buy something at a coffee shop or restaurant. 5) Continue to eat from our garden: tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, herbs. And, the pomegranates are almost ripe! Reply Not sure if this was frugal‚Äìlast Monday we drove to southern Maryland to a produce auction. It was organized twenty-some years ago when the Old Order Mennonites decided to stop growing tobacco and switch to produce. Farmers drove their horse-drawn carts through a gap in the auction house. One paid by the item but had to buy the whole lot. Last year I got 32 long-necked pumpkins someplace else. We had eaten them all by mid-April. So I bid on a lot of 42 winter squash‚Äìand won. We schlepped them all home, and I weighed them as Bill brought them into the basement. They average 15 pounds compared to last year‚Äôs five and the lot included 46 rather than 42 squash. I have 682 pounds of delicious winter squash. It was time to call women I know who feed large families, hungry neighbors, or the homeless. I rehomed 15 of them yesterday and invited women to come back when they need more. I paid only 30 cents per pound at a time when winter squash run $2-3 per pound in stores. Other than that same old, same old‚Äìdrinking water, cooking at home, reading library books, and meeting my fabric needs by helping sort donations for my guild‚Äôs yard sale. Reply Mary in MD, that‚Äôs a wonderful story about the squash! You‚Äôve spread a circle of blessings far and wide. Reply Where is the auction? My daughter lives in Maryland. Is it a regular thing or just a one and done? Reply It‚Äôs the Loveville produce auction, slightly southeast of Leonardtown. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday through December. They have a website she can check out. Big lots and there is a small lot auction as well. I would have picked up cabbage, but the Prius was packed. Reply Wow, I always wanted to go to one of those auctions, what a steal on the squash! Are they all the same or different? I have at least 200 squash (squashs?) from my garden this year ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt believe how many grew, some are kind of weird (what IS that plant) but pretty, so may become decorations. Got 5 big cinderella type pumpkins and three lovely big white knobbly pumpkins, as well as a multitude of acorn, red kuri, baby pumpkin and medium pumpkin, delicata, plus a selection of dark green and light grey and blotchy and ‚Ä¶ names to be determined when I re-read the packages‚Ä¶ I am now like the zucchini growers, looking for open car windows, LOL. How do you like to cook your squash? Recipes appreciated! * as for sharing your bounty with families you know, that is what the deal-finders do ‚Äì let their friends know! Reply I think I have Boer, Musque de Provence, and New York cheese squash. I typed out my killer recipe for them last fall in these comments. Robin Robertson‚Äôs VEGAN ON THE CHEAP‚Äôs peanutty pumpkin stew. I bake them at 350 in halves if I can get them open, whole if I can‚Äôt. The ones with tan skin I chop in big chunks and bring to high in my pressure cooker, then turn off the burner. I use my immersion blender to puree them still in the cooker. Eating the skin isn‚Äôt a problem, but some people find green flecks off-putting. Reply 1. Used a package of gluten-free pizza dough mix to make two big batches of Italian herb flat bread. It came out quite nice. I cut it into single servings and froze it for my husband‚Äôs future meals. 2. My son accidentally bought a package of chicken sandwich meat he was never going to eat, so I chopped it up and used it with some last bits of frozen veggies, homegrown cherry tomatoes and rice to make a very tasty little casserole. 3. Rearranged our pantry to get some bulk purchased food from the clearance store off the floor. 4. Decluttered the pan shelf in the kitchen and found some items to donate, as I just do not bake desserts much any more. 5. The wind that came through from the hurricane tore loose a section of our bamboo fence, which I repaired with some bungee cords and filled in a spot where a bamboo cane shattered with straight sticks cut from some shrubbery. The giant catalpa leaves blown all over the yard got picked up and laid over some muddy areas to keep down the mud my dogs track into the house. Reply Glad you‚Äôre okay after the hurricane and only the fence needed bungee cords to hold it together. Don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôd do without bungee cords and duct tape! Reply Bungee cords are one of the most useful things. Right now one is holding my folded up clothes drying rack up off the floor so the puppy can‚Äôt chew on it and another is a divider in the metal mesh document holder on the side of the fridge. The uses are near endless! We need to replace the bamboo fence, but everything is so freaking expensive. Thst‚Äôs going to be a project to save up for. Reply Used up the last of the hello fresh discounted meals. Now making comprehensive shopping list We each get our $40 quarterly HABA allowance from United Healthcare so making a separate list for Walmart Sold 2 items via FB both happened to be dog show friends. Delivered 1 to a local dog show I happened to be going to. The other I‚Äôll deliver at a show in the future Reply I really prefer going for a walk with a friend or just sitting on the front porch with a glass of wine rather than dinner out. My daughters, mother and sister have a girls night out once a week. I‚Äôve said I wouldn‚Äôt mind if girls night became a bottle of wine with takeout and then help each other fix something or do a project around the house. Anyway here‚Äôs my FFT. 1. After many, many years of shopping for a new kitchen table and chairs I finally bought a set off of marketplace. It looks like it belongs in my kitchen and although it‚Äôs 25 years old it looks almost new. The only thing is I also had to take the china cabinet too. I don‚Äôt need another one and although it‚Äôs beautiful I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôll keep it. Right now I have the bottom half placed in my great room. I might sell it on marketplace or keep it in my basement for my next house. 2. I picked up a few ball jars on a free table while I was out of town. My daughter slammed on the brakes when she saw the free sign. That‚Äôs my kid. My other daughter took home a very cool vintage lamp. We are all very enthusiastic about free piles. 3. I finished a library book on my Kindle and started another. I‚Äôm most of the way through The Stone Girl by Dirk Wittenborn. It‚Äôs kind of dark but I can‚Äôt put it down. 4. My daughter is returning to her previous work schedule M-F which means I‚Äôll be dog sitting for her a few days a week. Her husband stayed with my dog while we were out of town. I‚Äôll also keep their dog while they are on their honeymoon. My oldest daughter and her husband will be gone for three weeks and my mom will keep their dog for them. It sounds crazy but it all works out. 5. I‚Äôm eating leftovers from an event I hosted at my house. All leftovers were divided and shared with whoever wanted them. I had several out of town guests that stayed with me which was a significant savings. Reply I‚Äôm also included in girls night‚Ä¶insert eye roll. Reply Some of my best time with my friends and family are when we go for walks in the neighborhood or do yard work. Maybe that makes me boring, but I‚Äôm ok with it. 1. Due to Hurricane Helene, which missed my area of Florida I was afforded a paid day off of work and some much needed down time. My son scored two days off school which he was able to make up some work. 2. I forced myself to look at sales adds and use Ibotta and some other apps when organizing my grocery list. The savings didn‚Äôt feel large, but I believe they add up. I can now cash out $23 in ibotta money. 3. I scanned my receipts into Fetch and Shopkick to also work toward giftcards in the future. I have stopped using Receipt Hog, a similar app, I scan but it doesn‚Äôt register the receipts. I tried! 4. I am considering going back to doing a sidegig delivery service. I signed up for Ubereats and realized I had to update my phone. I deleted over 2 gigs of data and updated only to find out that my model iphone will never udpate into ios 16 or higher which leaves me out of the Ubereats app‚Ä¶..back to the drawing board on weird sidegigs I can do to make more money. 5. I cooked from home for the last four days with us going for icecream twice. It felt nice to cook at home‚Ä¶..and a bit time consuming. But yay for eating what we already have at home and packing lunches. Reply 1. I too ordered free Covid tests and shared the news with my daughter and my sister. 2. The New York Times offered to upgrade my digital subscription to full access for the price I was paying ($1/week) for one year. Since this extended the time period I would pay that amount by several months I said yes. I noted the cancel date on my calendar. It is nice to have access to recipes and other things. 3. The grocery store had an offer to save $10 on groceries when you spend $50 on a certain gift card. I decided that was the cheapest way to obtain nutmeg. The nutmeg rang up for more than the shelf price so I received it for free. 4. I made a big pot of chili and used canned tomatoes that most needed to be used and low sodium beans I‚Äôd bought on clearance. 5. While we were in the Midwest we ate lunch at Culver‚Äôs and took the survey to receive free frozen custard. Reply Oh Culver‚Äôs! My fast-food weakness! Lucky I live in New England where there aren‚Äôt any or I would be there more than is healthy for me or my wallet. When we travel to an area that has Culver‚Äôs, we always make sure to pop in for something delicious. Reply Culver‚Äôs is quite prevalent in my area. Their food is well worth the price. I like it that they and another locally founded ‚Äúfast‚Äù food restaurant will raise prices rather than skimp on quality. Reply I was gifted a prayer plant in 2003 and it‚Äôs still living, having been re-potted a few times. Interesting when the new leaves start to open. You can actually hear them if things are very quiet ‚Äì scared me the first time it happened. LOL! Reply This is not frugal, but it makes my husband happy and that makes me happy: we bought an upright freezer with drawers that you pull out. So, now we have a drawer for meat, one for chicken and fish, another for‚Ä¶well, you get the point. His back has been hurting him and he would get so frustrated and in more pain trying to rummage around our chest freezer, so I would not ask him to get anything out of the chest freezer and things would get freezer burned. He is thrilled and, thus, so am I. It is our Christmas gift to each other because, really, we could have stumbled along the way we were. It is so wonderful to have things organized and easy to access. To compensate for this not frugal thing, I: 1. made myself list 10 items on eBay. Four have already sold! Turns out antique jewelry is a hot item. This alone paid for 75% of the freezer cost. 2. Took several bags of things to Good Will. Made sure to get a tax receipt. 3. Did 2 more post office mystery shops that were a longer drive from the house but were being paid with a bonus more than large enough. Another 3% of the freezer paid for. 4. Sent off a birthday gift with one of the post office shops, and a sold item with the other one. This saved me about $20, so more of the freezer paid off. 5. Took the chance and waited for an oil change mystery shop to have a bonus attached because no one wanted it. $160 paid for the oil change we get at the start of every winter, plus some cash. More of the freezer paid off. Only about $40 left to go and the freezer will not have taken anything out of our savings to pay for it. Reply Lindsey, the freezer sounds like an excellent use of your money. May you and your DH have less back pain and less freezer waste as a result. Reply The arthritis in my back was why I bought a small upright freezer to replace our little, very old chest freezer. The new freezer has fixed shelves, but I measured carefully and found baskets to fit at Dollar Tree that pull out so easily. Reply Your new freezer sounds wonderful and I‚Äôm sure your DH‚Äôs back will thank you both. I never saw one with pull-out drawers‚Ä¶how very convenient! Reply Lindsey, this made my heart sing. I love reading about the love you and your husband have for each other, the organized freezer you now have, and all of the ways you found to pay for it. Reply I‚Äôm so glad you got a new freezer that works for you and I like how you‚Äôre paying for it. That is awesome. Reply 1. Had some expired (with no extended dates) COVID test kits, so I opened them and recycled as many papers and boxes that I could before tossing the rest. Ugh, I hate waste. 2. Thanks to Heidi Louise‚Äôs tip, I ordered free COVID tests from our government. 3. Fed the exterior painting team chocolate cookies I received from a friend and Gatorade that I had received as part of a random take-all Buy Nothing post. I was planning to serve the painters lemonade and chocolate chip cookies, so the timing of the gifts worked out great. Now I can give those cookies and the lemonade to the landscape crew that will be here for three days. Among other things, they will be placing the 70+ boulders that came with our property within the new landscape and for rock walls needed for better drainage. The previous homeowner had the boulders in a pile in the backyard for years and never got around to using them. 4. Saved $1,200 in landscaping costs by moving rocks and plants ourselves and giving away other items on Buy Nothing. Not to mention free workouts! Also brought a carload of rocks to a dear neighbor and used the smaller-size rocks as fill where our driveway has washed out. Used part of the $1,200 savings to buy another tree and expand a planting area. 5. Attended an economist‚Äôs presentation at our financial advisor‚Äôs office and received a free lunch. Which is ironic since it was economist Milton Friedman who said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù Brought in papers for shredding as the office provides that service for free. Reply @MB in MN ‚Äì technically your lunch was not free. Time is our most precious resource and you spent time. My micro econ teacher had a true/false test question ‚ÄúIf lawyers didn‚Äôt charge fees, their services would be free‚Äù. False ‚Äì you‚Äôd have to spend time due to the demand of the lawyer‚Äôs services. But I do consider free shredding a good deal. Disappointed my go-to local bank has no shred day planned for the rest of this year. A local non-profit offered shred services but I think that went by the wayside during Covid. I should call and ask. I don‚Äôt mind paying. Reply FFT, Freebies Galore Edition: (1) On my usual early a.m. stroll through the ‚Äòhood, I came across several interesting finds. The first = two grocery bags full of books in the recycling containers of a nearby apartment complex. The bags were so full that I wasn‚Äôt able to get them out of the containers, let alone carry them home on foot. But I reached my ‚Äúpicking stick‚Äù into one bag and fished out one book‚Äìwhich turned out to be a nice paperback translation into English of Virgil‚Äôs epic The Aeneid?!? (As Mrs. Rachel Lynde says in one of the Anne of Green Gables books, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never safe from being surprised till you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù) So I‚Äôm planning a predawn return tomorrow to this site with the Honda Element and will persuade the bags out of the containers by whatever means. (2) This one‚Äôs for you, texasilver: My next surprise came at the local Dollar General‚Äôs dumpster‚Äìwhich is usually kept locked, but which was unlocked and open this morning, with a heaping helping of clean, undamaged, and within-date foodstuffs (mostly cereals and crackers) on top. Fortunately, I had a clean backup bag with me, so I loaded it with a family-size box of Kellogg‚Äôs Raisin Bran, a box of Ritz crackers, and two boxes of Nature Valley ‚Äúblueberry muffins‚Äù bars (new to me, and I look forward to trying them). And I‚Äôm going to take the Element around there tomorrow too, in the hope of scoring more stuff‚Äìalthough this may be chancier. (3) On the set of Depression-era brick steps connecting the main drag below us (where the Dollar General is) with our cul-de-sac at the top of the hill, I found not only more NY State deposit bottles and cans‚Äìwhich were what I was really looking for in my (1) and (2)‚Äìbut a good solid steel made-in-USA pry bar. I scooped that up immediately, both on general principles and in case whoever left it on the steps was planning to use it for petty crime. (4) One of my later morning errands today was a stop at the pop-up thrift shop run out of a disused bowling alley on Monday mornings only by a local Catholic church, in aid of its food pantry. In addition to my purchases (two Chico‚Äôs tops, a pair each of Lane Bryant and Martha Stewart brand jeans, and four skeins of yarn for my next-door neighbor‚Äôs close friend, for a grand total of $10), I took a just-past-sell-by date package of Thomas‚Äôs English muffins from the free bin. (5) And I‚Äôm about to head over to the link provided by Katy for the free COVID tests. Thanks, Katy, and let‚Äôs all be prepared! Reply A. Marie, I just want to say that you seem like a very good and caring person and I always enjoy your comments here and on The Frugal Girl. Reply Holy Smokes!! I cannot believe the Dollar store bounty. We do not have one of those in Fairbanks, and I have never been to one when we go Outside, so when people talk about the great deals there I am envious. But to get them for free from their dumpster!! I do have a dumpster story. I once picked up my mail from the post office (there was no delivery to the cabin I was living in, back in the hills) and as I was leaving, I stopped at the open dumpster in the back of the post office to throw away junk mail. Just as I flung some in, I realized I had also thrown in a check for an article I had written. The dumpster was nearly empty so I could not possibly reach the check‚Ä¶I decided to climb in to retrieve it. As it turned out, I was a lot more athletic in my dreams than I was in reality. I could not get out. I finally had to shout for help and eventually this guy peered in and asked me if I was okay. I did not answer with sarcasm, as he was my knight in shining armor. He stood there a minute and said (and I will never forget this), ‚ÄúMiss, getting you out of there is going to be a two man job. I‚Äôll be back.‚Äù I was in my 20s and as thin as I ever was going to be‚Ä¶He was good to his word, returning with a real bruiser of a guy who had been drinking. The post office was three doors from a bar, so he probably went in there and grabbed the nearest big man. They tried, heroically, to yank me out by my arms, to no avail. Finally the bigger one said, ‚ÄúI think I can push her ass up and if you can finish pulling her out.‚Äù It was very humiliating to have this guy help me put a foot up on the inside brace of the dumpster, and then he put his back against my rear and with a lot of groaning hoisted me up enough that the other guy and I, working together, could pull me out. I was filthy and there was a moment when we thought the inebriated fellow was going to have to be rescued, but eventually it was all over and I went home to wash my clothes. So, when I hear of you and others going into a dumpster, I know that not even bars of gold could tempt me back into one of those things. Reply Lindsey, just to clarify: I have climbed into a few dumpsters back in the days when I was young and agile, but not this time. I simply reached in with my picking stick and retrieved enough items to fill my clean bag that way. I no longer take witless chances. But that‚Äôs quite a ripping yarn about you and the check and the two rescuers (one sober and one not so much). Count me in among the many fans who think you should write an autobiography, in addition to the Adventures of Houndini and Clobber Paws. Reply Frugality inspires resourcefulness! Whatever method you need to employ to retrieve your foodstuffs is a good one. Reply I‚Äôve done a lot of trash picking but never actually crawled into a dumpster. I was shocked a couple years ago when we were staying at the shore in a house with a bathtub. I decided a long soak with exfoliation would be a great vacation activity. When it was time to get out, I couldn‚Äôt. By the time the Mister got back, the water and I were both very cold. Reply You made me smile A. Marie! You never know what treasure a Dol Gen dumpster will contain. Reply Thanks Katy and Heidi Louise for the tip about the Covid tests. Like A. Marie, I‚Äôm headed over to the site after I finish my FFTs to order some. 1. While out walking with DH, I saw something in a familiar shape in the dirt by the side of the road. Turned out to be a quarter, dirty and almost unrecognizable, but I brought it home, cleaned it up and into the found change jar it went. 2. I found a deposit can on another walk with DH. Only worth 5 cents in my state but I wouldn‚Äôt walk by a nickel laying on the ground, so I grabbed it. 3. Like Jill A and others here, I much prefer hosting guests at my house or going to others‚Äô houses for get togethers. It‚Äôs not only for the savings but because we can sit around and eat, drink and talk until the cows come home and nobody cares. In a restaurant, there‚Äôs always the old side eye from the waitress or hostess who want to keep things moving. I understand in that business time is money which is why I prefer socializing in other ways. Walking is a great way to socialize and get steps in, I find. 4. Speaking of‚Ä¶we had a couple we‚Äôve been friends with for years come over on Friday night for the above-mentioned way of entertaining. DH wanted pizza so we bit the bullet, ordered two and sat on the deck gabbing and talking for five hours! They brought beer and we had seltzer (store brand) on hand. Great time. 5. Reading a library book: The Witches Daughter by Orenda Fink. Great book if you like memoirs. Reply 1. I did another mystery shop with a *relatively* good payout of $22 to eat a hot dog and some fries, and it was in the neighborhood of several errands. 2. Almost stuck to my list at the grocery store, but I did purchase a $2.50 container of dolmas (for 10). I‚Äôll have a couple for my lunch ‚Äúon the road‚Äù and it will keep me from stopping somewhere. Like Katy, I also did used Fetch to get all of my 25 points, as I rarely get anything more due to lack of name brand purchases. 3. I stopped into the more expensive Stop & Shop to pick up 3 items from FlashFoods, which I notice now charge a 5% processing fee (lame). While there, I bought 1 loss leader and picked up a free jar of Chosen Mayo (who would pay $8.67 for a jar is beyond me, but I‚Äôll happily pay $0.00). 4. I signed up for my free Covid and Flu shop. I hate getting shots (or anything with a needle) but this will means 20 points toward the 200 points that I have to ‚Äúearn‚Äù to get 10% off my annual cost of health insurance. 5. I did a survey for Nielson‚Äôs of my media usage. It took less than 5 minutes and I got a $10 gift certificate of my choosing. Reply Loved your 5 FFTs. It‚Äôs the small and medium savings that can really add up. And I agree‚Ä¶$8.67 for a jar of mayo sounds like highway robbery. Reply 1. I made a hashbrown casserole, using up some eggs and cream that needed to be used. Now I have several breakfasts ready in the freezer for when I need something quick. 2. I cancelled my Walmart+ subscription. I had tried it for a month, and I did use it enough in September to make the cost worthwhile, but I don‚Äôt want to keep paying for it long term. 3. I bought only items that were on sale at Kroger. I was pretty pleased with some of the deals I got, especially a $0.39 chocolate bar from a fancy brand that normally would be out of my price range. 4. Same old, same old otherwise. Reply 1. I also ordered the free Covid tests and they are en route to us now. Our library also had free tests, so I was able to get one more box there. 2. Had a free trial week of Paramount and when I clicked cancel on the last day, they offered me a free month. I watched Mayor of Kingstown and Yellowjackets, but there‚Äôs not a lot I‚Äôm tempted by. 3. Attended the fall rummage sale at a local church. I think it‚Äôs one of the few places left that still has items priced at a nickel and a dime. I found a few things for myself, and a bunch of good stuff to resell, including a vintage leather Coach purse for $3, and brand new LL Bean boots for $2. 4. I had a poor experience at Kroger, and sent an email when I got home. They apologized and gave me a $15 store credit. 5. Not a frugal win for me, but I created one for someone else. I found a wallet in the street on my morning walk. I tracked down the owner online and they picked it up later that day, and sincerely thanked me. Reply That‚Äôs how you and I differ, as I love all the StarTrek series! Reply Thanks for letting me know about the Covid tests. I just ordered more. 1. We were supposed to have a yard sale Saturday and Sunday but it rained all day Saturday so we moved it to Sunday and Monday. My daughter and FIL both set up tables too. My son had to work but gave me a few things to sell. Between all of us we made over $700. The truck is full of leftovers and we are dropping it off tomorrow morning at our church thrift store. 2. I cooked in the crockpot both days to avoid takeout. 3. We gave several items to our neighbor that she was interested in for her grand kids. She brought us bagels as a thank you. Yummy. 4. A fan my FIL was trying to sell didn‚Äôt, so I kept if for our guest room. 5. My daughter and I did a fall deer painting class that was free at the library. I picked up 2 new to me puzzles while I was there. I dropped off 1 in return. Reply 1. Got my Covid shot today. I had already gotten a flu shot where I work, but they don‚Äôt have Covid vaccines. For that, I went to a CVS located inside a Target store. My Medicare card allowed me to get the shot free, no copayment, and I asked them about coupons; I‚Äôd read where some stores give you freebies for getting your vaccine with them. The pharmacist was just going to let me walk off without one, but since I spoke up, I got a coupon for $5 off a $20 purchase, good for 30 days. 2. We have new neighbors and they came and brought me some home-baked loaves of bread. He‚Äôs a home chef. 3. Signed up for more substitute teacher gigs. 4. Cut up more limbs and brush and put them out for garbage pickup. Hid them in 2 huge contractor‚Äôs bags which I put in the bottom of the regular trash can. Came home and they‚Äôre all gone‚Ä¶.or at least THIS weekend‚Äôs batch was gone. Slowly but surely I am getting all the brush hauled off without paying the landfill fee to dump them. City Garbage Dept. only picks up brush twice monthly, so I have to get creative about disposing of same. 5. Went to the bank to check on my finances. All is well. Reply 1. Many years ago I gave my niece and her husband a dresser when they were first starting out as newlyweds. 12 years later she offered to give it back. I accepted as I have been saving to buy a new dresser for my new primary bedroom which will be in my addition, which isn‚Äôt quite finished. So now I can use that money elsewhere. 2. My cousin who lives on a nearby island had me over for two days, taking me out for dinner one night (which was lovely) and cooking for me one night (also lovely). He picked me up from the ferry terminal so I didn‚Äôt have to pay for my car. I also have a discount card for the ferry which saved me about $4. We went for a walk to a beautiful beach and had a picnic lunch from leftovers, some of which I had brought from home. It was a wonderful mini vacation for me. 3. Dh managed to remove two bathroom windows (without breaking them) which we can now sell. 4. Picking my own dahlias for a bouquet to decorate my Airbnb cottage whenever I have guests. 5. Gave my friend‚Äôs 88 year old mother some kale and cherry tomatoes out of my garden, and she gave me a jar of her strawberry jam. Reply 1. While doing some citizen science collecting water at a creek, found $8 in loonies ($1 coins) and twoonies ($2 coins). Took all but one, as they were sitting on a rock in the middle of a creek that was going to flood the next day. Whoot, $7 for the found money jar that I didn‚Äôt have until now. The next day, when back for another citizen science collection, I noted that the coin was gone, although the water hadn‚Äôt yet risen that far. It will be a mystery to me why those coins were there in that lovely neat pile. (down a very slick steep route ‚Äì not a path, more like a slide, hold on to trees and hope you don‚Äôt misstep. Who would GO down there?) 2. Made fajitas with chicken legs I had cooked in the instant pot (bones back in the pot for broth), and discount purple and yellow peppers, as well as a couple of sad onions. I have made up a spice mix that saves me time when making mexican food, so the meal came together quickly with rice from a discount bag bought (ahem) a while ago. Homemade tomatillo salsa and some tortillas I had picked up on discount, I was in heaven. 3. Had a not-frugal 4 days as I flew a long way up north in my province to ask for signatures so that my political party will have a candidate in that riding for the upcoming provincial election. After two full days of talking to a LOT of very nice people, I successfully collected the required number of signatures (went out for insurance signatures, just in case) and completed the applicaiton with 1/2 day to spare. I am now the ‚Äòpaper‚Äô candidate in that riding ‚Äì where I have not a hope of being elected, due to some pretty divisive politics up there, however people who are looking for an alternative to the big two will have a choice on their ballots. Democracy for the win! (kind of‚Ä¶). My flight and hotel and car rental were paid, and I was very careful with the meals I purchased to save the party money ‚Äì the hotel had a very good breakfast for free so I ate well in the morning then did without until evening. So glad to be home, though. 4. As mentioned in a comment above, I harvested a LOT of winter squash with the help of a young friend. It was SO much fun, and a lot of work ‚Äì my lawn tractor trailer was full 4 times! I lent a pickup truck bed‚Äôs worth of squash to another young friend who needed them for his work (they were doing a photo-shoot) and I gave him two huge stalks of multiple sunflowers when he came over ‚Äì might as well share them when they are perfect, eh? The remainder of the squash were washed with the help of Wonder James, and put into my grow room, resting on Bread Trays for air flow and under lights for curing. (best gardening hack ‚Äì old bread trays are useful for so many things) 5. Got a huge load of firewood delivered (not frugal), and while Wonder James was stacking it in the woodshed/hayshed, he had to temporarily pull out the haybales. He came and knocked on my door with his shirt front bulging out ‚Äì he had found a hidden chicken nest, and presented me with 18 eggs! GAH. Then, when I went out to check on things, I saw that he hadn‚Äôt brought in the nest I knew about (another 16 eggs) and THEN he started pulling eggs from between two bales. I think I have 8 dozen ‚Äòfound and questionable‚Äô eggs! The birds had been suddenly unproductive about 2 weeks ago, so now I know where they were laying, instead‚Ä¶ANYWAY, I am using these eggs by washing them, ensuring they are lying flat while in the water (indication of age, if they float one end up they are older. Not BAD per-se, but older)/ Any ‚Äògood‚Äô ones I am breaking one-by-one into a small bowl before using, and they are all fine. The dog gets the partial floaters, if there are any. I am researching frozen quiches‚Ä¶ 6. Oh, and if I haven‚Äôt mentioned it, I am now a grandmother of a lovely little boy ‚Äì born August 30th. Was a last minute caesarian, so Mom and Dad were in a bit of shock, however this kiddo is just about the easiest baby one could imagine, so they are having a break there as mom recovers (and struggles with some issues). Both Mom and Dad caught covid, so I haven‚Äôt seen the baby for a week, hope to change that tomorrow, now that I am back from my travels Reply Congratulations Grandma!! Reply Fair play to you for spreading the plant love! 5 frugal things: * The cauliflower in Lidl has a price per piece and there just happened to be a piece in the box that was double the size of all the others so I did of course buy that very one! üôÇ There was enough for a side dish for one evening and for cauliflower cheese soup for the day after. * I attended several free talks as part of a local festival. * Somehow managed to rip my pants on the car and promptly mended them. * Found a beautiful handmade pottery dish and set it aside for the Christmas presents stash. * The teens declared a packet of grapes that I had gotten as ‚Äútoo soft‚Äù so I suggested they freeze the grapes and have them as a frozen snack. They didn‚Äôt love them but they ate them! Reply fwiw, I was curious and clicked on your Fetch referral link but it didn‚Äôt work for me: ‚Äúapp_not_found.‚Äù Thanks for all your frugal five posts, Katy.

Title: Why Amazon‚Äôs Back To Work Order Is A Warning For The Future Of Work
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2024/09/30/why-amazons-back-to-work-order-is-a-warning-for-the-future-of-work/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T12:00:00Z

Amazon's return-to-work mandate is the canary in the workplace coal mine. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last week called all of the company‚Äôs employees back to the office five days a week, part of an effort to preserve the company‚Äôs culture and return to a pre-Covid reality. By clawing back the pre-pandemic era, Jassy reminded the world that companies have officially regained the upper hand ‚Äî hiring, firing and changing the rules at will. And Amazon has certainly flexed that power, laying off more 27,000 of its workers since 2022 and now rescinding flexibility for the rest. Amazon‚Äôs decision isn‚Äôt just another episode in the return-to-work soap opera. It‚Äôs actually the canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem. The relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration. And that‚Äôs seriously eroding trust, which drives engagement, loyalty, belonging and performance. And leaders know this full well. PWC‚Äôs Invesco Dynamic Market ETF 2024 Trust Survey found that 93% of business executives say building and maintaining trust is critical to the bottom line. Yet only 23% of employees trust their company leaders to do the right thing. And 40% of employees don‚Äôt feel trusted by their leaders. Little wonder with so many companies using surveillance devices to measure keystrokes, police attendance and test loyalty. This is a far cry from the pandemic-promised ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù‚Äìa clean sheet of paper to design and build the winning workplace of the future. We imagined a place where productivity and flexibility worked hand in glove, where employees could learn, grow and collaborate in innovative new ways‚Äìtogether. But this vision has stalled‚Äìwith whiplash-level force. Through the lens of Amazon‚Äôs actions, the workplace looks more like Game of Thrones: a battle to control and conquer rather than create a community of collaborative colleagues. Here are three ways we‚Äôre all going to lose if the battle continues. To state the obvious, the last few years have seen a lot of upheaval. First, demand for talent in a tight labor market empowered employees to make significant inroads in work-life balance. Employers offered flexible and hybrid work options, wellness benefits and rising wages. As the economy became uncertain, employers reclaimed control, leveraging an extraordinary number of layoffs that destabilized and disenfranchised workers. Flexible work had become a common, even expected, feature of the modern workplace, until many organizations, like Amazon, arbitrarily pulled employees back to offices. This power struggle takes a toll on both employees and the organization‚Äîreplacing relationships with transactions. Employees are not widgets. Rapidly growing technologies, diverse generational norms and a tough competitive landscape are bringing seismic changes to the workplace, requiring individuals to work together more than ever. The transactional tenor of many recent workplace decisions forces people to protect themselves, to act competitively instead of collaboratively. Employees who trust that their employers have their back are 260% more motivated at work. When people feel valued, share a strong common purpose, and have invested in the skills to work better together, they are more innovative and collaborative. Turning the workplace into a zero-sum game undermines workers, erodes culture and damages productivity. As work becomes more transactional, the underlying social contract among colleagues becomes frayed. Many assume that the social contract is an agreement between employer and employee on treating each other with respect and consideration. That's not a social contract, it's a code of conduct. The social contract is the fabric that holds a company together. It's grounded on an understanding among colleagues, from the CEO to the front line, that collective success is powered by individual commitment‚Äìto the mission and more importantly to each other. Colleagues in an organization with a healthy social contract ask themselves, ‚Äúwhat do we owe each other?‚Äù What does this look like in real time? A manufacturing executive in a company with a fledgling apprentice program for urban youth cosigning bank accounts so that they can build productive and fiscally sound habits. Another skipping a family dinner to help an apprentice with their algebra homework, because success at work starts with confidence and self-efficacy in life. Or a female software engineer who adds hours to her week mentoring younger women so that they can advance in their careers, finishing her own work late at night. An effective social contract requires a strong sense of agency, where each person has the power and autonomy to represent the organization and its values from a place of authenticity and belonging. Layoffs and work mandates rob employees, at all levels, of that agency. When they stop caring, they give up. And the social contract dies‚Äìtaking productivity and profits to the grave. In his missive, Amazon CEO Jassy leans hard on culture, citing it as a critical success driver for the company. He justifies his decision to ‚Äústrengthen‚Äù a face-to-face culture, where ‚Äúcollaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.‚Äù What exactly does he mean by culture? Does it jive with what his employees believe the culture might be? Culture has come to loosely mean ‚Äúhow I like to work.‚Äù For example, the evidence is mounting that hybrid workplaces yield the strongest productivity and creativity. But for older leaders, the nostalgic pull of the watercooler remains steadfast. Many of Jassy‚Äôs frustrated employees (especially members of the massive water-bottle carrying generation who have no memories of the communal fountain) may describe Amazon‚Äôs culture as ‚Äútoxic,‚Äù a commonly heard refrain when workers are at odds with their employers. Remember quiet quitting? Culture is not a weapon to be thrown around by the person with the largest muscle. Admittedly elusive, culture encompasses the norms and practices that guide the way we work together; it‚Äôs the how, not the where. It‚Äôs about productivity and engagement and a healthy social contract. And while it‚Äôs tough, it‚Äôs not impossible to take a more evidence-based approach (both qualitative and quantitative) to understand when it‚Äôs at its best. Until we agree on what a healthy culture looks like, it‚Äôs just another pawn in the workplace power struggle. The Amazon decision clearly signals the where-we-work conversation is not over. And although Amazon may have broken from the tech pack, we will now see other companies (tech and beyond) following suit with RTO orders. The only thing we know for sure is that the pendulum keeps swinging. When the economy gets tough, companies win the throne. In boom times, employees wrestle it back. And trust takes a hit every time. Sustainable success requires more than survival of the fittest. It‚Äôs time to end the battle and make an authentic commitment to working together. The future of work depends on putting away the sword and picking up the social contract. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Metaverse Gamble Pays Off With $201 Billion Fortune

Photo Credit: Meta Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse initially looked like a colossal mistake, wiping more than $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,39,113 crore) from his net worth. But now it's paying off big-time. Buoyed by a record-high Meta Platforms share price, Zuckerberg's net worth has climbed almost sixfold in less than two years to $201 billion (roughly Rs. 16,86,617 crore), the first time he's exceeded the $200 billion mark (roughly Rs. 16,78,226 crore), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's moved to fourth place on the list of the world's 500 richest people behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault. While other tech titans made big jumps in net worth this year ‚Äî Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, for example, has more than doubled his wealth to $106.2 billion (roughly Rs.8,91,138 crore) ‚Äî none has grown as much as Zuckerberg's. He's added $73.4 billion (roughly Rs. 6,15,908 crore) to his fortune since January 1, thanks to his 13 percent stake in Meta. The stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday and is up 60 percent this year. It's a far cry from 2022, when the stock, and Zuckerberg's net worth, took a nosedive after his company had undergone massive changes, including a name change and big investments in the metaverse. At the time, Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity. Now, analysts think that the pivot from Facebook to Meta is finally coming to fruition as the company heavily leans into its Orion Augmented Reality glasses. ‚ÄúWith the confluence of Meta's hardware improvements over the last five years and progress with AI, Orion represents Meta's evolution from a social media company to a Metaverse company,‚Äù JMP Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. Since 2022, Meta has cut tens of thousands of employees, shrinking its global workforce by 25 percent. The Menlo Park, California-based company has made moves to improve its stock performance, including a $50 billion (roughly Rs. 4,18,928 crore) share buyback program and Meta's first-ever quarterly dividend. It has also hopped onto the Artificial-Intelligence (AI) bandwagon, spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company recently announced further investments into AI-generated creators, which interact one-on-one with online fans. Zuckerberg's public image has also changed dramatically from two years ago. Previously portrayed as a nerdy techie, the 40-year-old CEO has taken up wakesurfing and mixed martial arts. A photo of a seven-foot statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, recently went viral on Instagram, with Zuckerberg claiming that he was ‚Äúbringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.‚Äù He's also said he plans to stay out of politics. After earlier offering up his views on social justice, inequality and immigration issues, he has since publicly expressed regret about some of his political activity. ‚ÄúThe political environment, I think I didn't have much sophistication around, and I think I just fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem,‚Äù he said during a live podcast event in San Francisco. ¬© 2024 Bloomberg LP For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: Bitcoin dominance drives $1.2B inflows in crypto investment products

Ethereum ended its five-week outflow streak with $87 million inflow. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Inflows into crypto-related investment products continued for the third consecutive week, with $1.2 billion flowing into the sector, according to CoinShares‚Äô latest weekly report. James Butterfill, CoinShares‚Äô head of research, attributed the strong inflows to expectations of a dovish US monetary policy and positive market momentum. These factors pushed total assets under management up 6.2% to $92.7 billion. The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved options trading for BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF, which also lifted market sentiment. Despite these inflows, weekly trading volume in the sector dipped by 3.1%. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance continues The CoinShares report showed that Bitcoin continued to dominate the flows, with investors pouring in $1 billion to BTC-related investment products. This can be linked to its strong price performance and also the improved inflows to spot Bitcoin ETF products last week. Notably, the funds run by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark 21 Shares all saw positive performance during the reporting period. However, Grayscale‚Äôs crypto funds continued their net outflow trend, dropping its total assets to $21.2 billion. Meanwhile, BTC‚Äôs recent uptrend to around $65,000 fueled an $8.8 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, as some investors expect the current rally to fade. Regionally, sentiment was divided. The US led with $1.2 billion in inflows, while Switzerland trailed with $84 million. In contrast, Germany and Brazil experienced outflows of $21 million and $3 million, respectively. Ethereum-related products ended a five-week outflow streak, bringing in $87 million‚Äîthe first significant inflow since early August. Data from SosoValue showed that spot Ethereum ETFs saw the second-highest weekly flows since their launch in July. On the other hand, large-cap alternative digital assets had mixed results. Litecoin and XRP recorded inflows of $2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Solana and Binance faced outflows of $4.8 million and $1.2 million. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The Billion-Dollar AI Gamble: Data Centers As The New High-Stakes Game

High-tech Data Centers Powering Critical AI And Digital Applications Require Careful And Intense ... [+] Planning. In today‚Äôs hyper-connected world, data centers have become the nerve centers of our digital economy. Hyperscale tech giants like Microsoft and global investment powerhouses like BlackRock are pooling their vast resources and pouring billions into data center construction, betting that these facilities will underpin the next wave of technological innovation. With artificial intelligence evolving at a dizzying pace, the stakes have never been higher. A prime example of this is the recent announcement of a groundbreaking 1 GW data center near Houston‚Äîan off-grid, hydrogen-powered hub designed to fuel AI. This colossal project underscores the immense scale of the high-stakes AI gamble. The U.S. government is paying close attention. The White House has created a Task Force on AI Datacenter Infrastructure to prioritize AI data center development as a matter of national security and economic interest. CEOs of the biggest data center operators and tech firms‚ÄîCoreWeave, QTS, Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Anthropic‚Äîrecently met with utility industry leaders to ensure that the U.S. maintains its competitive edge in AI infrastructure. But with these massive investments come immense risks. As tech investors begin to scrutinize the timing of returns on these AI ventures, it‚Äôs critical to understand the specific use cases of data centers before committing billions of dollars to their development. Data centers are not fungible or easily repurposed without massive capital expenditure. The adage ‚Äúmeasure twice, cut once‚Äù has never been more appropriate‚Äîespecially when a 100 MW facility could set you back $1.4 billion. This financial reality is why titans like Microsoft and BlackRock are joining forces to tackle these high-stakes projects in partnership, rather than going it alone. Data centers are built to handle staggering volumes of data and traffic with minimal latency, making them indispensable for a wide range of critical functions. But the design of these data centers must be closely tied to their intended use case. For instance, crypto mining prioritizes cheap power over low latency, which profoundly affects location, design, and redundancy requirements. Meanwhile, AI inference workloads require high computational power and very low latency, demanding a different approach altogether. The importance of data centers in today‚Äôs digital economy cannot be overstated‚Äîthey are the lifeblood of everything from: These are just a few examples of how data centers are integrated into every corner of modern life. As digital needs continue to grow, the complexities of building and managing these facilities also expand. Building a data center is no simple task. A typical facility houses racks of physical servers, cutting-edge networking equipment, and massive storage devices‚Äîall supported by a highly redundant power and cooling infrastructure designed to ensure near-perfect uptime. Today‚Äôs data centers are increasingly reliant on smart control systems, like Data Center Infrastructure Management software, to optimize performance and energy efficiency. But data centers are not cookie-cutter solutions. They require significant upfront planning and capital. Each type of data center is designed to meet specific needs, and changing use cases down the line can have disastrous effects on long-term viability and profitability. When building or investing in a data center, understanding the different types is crucial: Data centers are also traditionally ranked by tier, based on their expected uptime and reliability: As AI and machine learning become more central to the global economy, data centers will play an even more critical role in powering our digital world. But with this expansion comes significant risk and complexity. The rapid growth in AI workloads adds pressure on data centers to deliver more computational power with lower latency, but the costs of getting it wrong are enormous. That‚Äôs why carefully assessing the intended use case of a data center before committing to construction is essential. The companies that approach data center investments strategically‚Äîby aligning technology with specific business drivers‚Äîwill be the ones to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape. Those who fail to understand the nuances of data center design, construction, and operation could face enormous financial losses and miss out on the AI-driven future. One Community. Many Voices.

On Monday, JPMorgan reiterated its Neutral rating on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:OKTA) with a steady price target of $105.00. The firm's commentary followed a virtual investor meeting held last week in Asia with Okta's SVP of Investor Relations, Dave Gennarelli. The discussions covered a range of topics including the identity market, Okta's growth prospects, long-term potential, competitive dynamics, and recent events such as the FBI raid on Carahsoft. "The company continues to take a thoughtful approach toward building a competitive platform while balancing necessary investments with profitability," said JPMorgan analysts in a note. In other recent news, Okta Inc . has seen adjustments in its financial outlook following its second-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. The company reported a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $646 million, primarily due to a 17% rise in subscription revenue. However, Okta's third-quarter calculated remaining performance obligations (cRPO) guidance fell short of projections. Analyst firms such as Piper Sandler and Canaccord Genuity adjusted their price targets for Okta to $100 and $90, respectively. In contrast, BMO Capital Markets raised its price target to $103, citing Okta's robust growth in remaining performance obligations. Deutsche Bank lowered its price target for Okta's shares to $115 while maintaining a Buy rating. To complement JPMorgan's analysis, recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context on Okta's financial position and market performance. Despite the company's focus on balancing investment and profitability, InvestingPro data shows that Okta was not profitable over the last twelve months, with an adjusted operating income of -$228 million. However, the company's gross profit margin stands at an impressive 75.82%, reflecting strong pricing power in its identity management offerings. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Okta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it navigates market challenges and invests in growth. Additionally, 31 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting a potentially positive outlook that aligns with JPMorgan's steady price target. It's worth noting that Okta's stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -29.28%. This decline might present an opportunity for investors, as the RSI suggests the stock is in oversold territory. For those interested in a deeper dive into Okta's financials and market position, InvestingPro offers 10 additional tips that could inform investment decisions.

MIDLAND, Texas - AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS), which is developing a space-based cellular broadband network, announced the preliminary results of its redemption of all outstanding public warrants. The warrants were redeemed at $0.01 per warrant as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on Friday, September 27, 2024. According to the company's preliminary data, approximately 99.89% of the outstanding public warrants were exercised for cash at $11.50 per share of Class A common stock. This led to the exercise of 13,581,996 public warrants, leaving only 260,987 unexercised as of the redemption date. The final results of the redemption will be confirmed after the broker protect period expires on October 1, 2024. Following this redemption, AST SpaceMobile has no public warrants outstanding. The redemption follows an announcement made on August 28, 2024, in which AST SpaceMobile stated its intention to redeem these warrants as per the Warrant Agreement from September 13, 2019. The public warrants have ceased trading and were delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with the trading suspension taking effect on September 27, 2024. The company's Class A common stock continues to be traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "ASTS." AST SpaceMobile is focused on creating a global cellular broadband network in space that would directly work with standard mobile devices. This initiative is aimed at providing connectivity solutions for commercial and government applications, addressing the connectivity gaps for mobile subscribers and reaching unconnected populations. The company's press release also contains forward-looking statements regarding its strategies, financial performance expectations, and future business plans. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. This article is based on a press release statement and does not constitute an offer to sell AST SpaceMobile securities or a solicitation of an offer to buy. The press release includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ from those projected. In other recent news, AST SpaceMobile has made substantial progress with its satellite launch and financial growth. The company successfully launched five commercial satellites, named BlueBirds, advancing its mission to establish the first space-based cellular broadband network. These satellites are designed to provide cellular broadband speeds directly to mobile phones, with an aim to deliver non-continuous coverage across the United States and selected global markets. In addition to this, the company's stockholders approved the 2024 Incentive Award Plan, aligning the interests of service providers with shareholders. This development comes alongside Deutsche Bank's significant increase in the price target for AST SpaceMobile, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. AST SpaceMobile also confirmed the launch date for its first five BlueBird satellites, aiming to provide cellular broadband service directly to standard smartphones. B.Riley raised the stock price target for the company, reflecting confidence in its growth outlook. These developments are part of AST SpaceMobile's broader mission to bridge connectivity gaps for mobile subscribers and bring broadband to those currently unconnected.

AST SpaceMobile's recent warrant redemption aligns with its ambitious plans to develop a space-based cellular broadband network. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at $7.16 billion, reflecting investor optimism about its potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight that ASTS holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it pursues its innovative technology. This strong cash position is particularly crucial given the capital-intensive nature of space-based communications projects. The company's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a 773.1% price total return over the past six months. This surge aligns with the growing interest in space-based technologies and the potential disruption of traditional telecommunications. However, investors should note that ASTS is not currently profitable, with a negative operating income of $238.34 million in the last twelve months. The InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts do not anticipate profitability this year underscores the long-term nature of the company's ambitious projects. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for ASTS, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Bernard Arnault leapfrogs Mark Zuckerberg on wealth rankings with $30 billion boost, but analysts warn it may be short lived
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/30/bernard-arnault-mark-zuckerberg-wealth-lvmh-luxury-industry/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T10:54:46Z
Full Content:
The fortunes of luxury titan Bernard Arnault‚Äîand the raft of plush brands he oversees‚Äîseem to have turned around in the past week, courtesy of changing tides in China and a bet on a new fashion house. Per the Bloomberg Billionaire‚Äôs Index, Arnault‚Äôs fortune leapt from $177 billion on Tuesday to $207 billion less than a week later. Bernard Arnault‚Äôs Louis Vuitton Mo√´t Hennessy (LVMH) has suffered a bumpy few months, down near-15% at the time of writing over the past half year. Its problems included Chinese consumers tightening their purse strings and a significant drop in its wine and spirits divisions. But in the past week Beijing has announced a raft of fiscal stimulus to boost consumers, and LVMH announced it has acquired a stake in Italian fashion house Moncler. A more optimistic regional outlook paired with new investment by the Parisian-based group has led to a surge in the business‚Äôs stock price. From Wednesday to Friday last week LVMH‚Äôs share price bounced 14% from ‚Ç¨617.50 to ‚Ç¨703.40 ($690.74 to $786.83). The bounce has led to a corresponding surge in Arnault‚Äôs fortunes‚Äîafter all, he owns a 48% stake in the consumables giant. The 75-year-old entrepreneur saw his worth leap by approximately $30 billion‚Äîleapfrogging Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs net worth to put him at number three on the rich list. However, Arnault still comes in behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While being the third-richest person on the planet might be alright for some, Arnault as the former world‚Äôs richest man is unlikely to be satisfied. He reportedly once said: ‚ÄúAs long as I‚Äôm not the richest man in the world, I won‚Äôt really be happy.‚Äù While LVMH rounded out last week with an indirect investment in outdoor apparel maker Moncler, Wall Street remains unconvinced that the luxury sector as a whole is still the best value for investors. LVMH bought a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle owned by Remo Ruffini‚Äîthe CEO of Moncler‚Äîand one of the brand‚Äôs largest shareholders. But while increasing LVMH‚Äôs influence over European luxury houses might have led to a temporary uptick, analysts are concerned prevailing winds will slow the sector further. A Bank of America note released last week declared: ‚ÄúThe luxury consumer is all shopped out.‚Äù It added sector growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year and early next, leading to margin pressure and no EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth. Analysts downgraded LVMH from a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô to a ‚Äòneutral‚Äô position‚Äîthe same that was applied to Italian fashion house Zegna and Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci owner, Kering. Research analysts Ashley Wallace, Daria Nasledysheva, Ioanna Ziarti, Joffrey Bellicha Meller, Adam Gildea and Niccolo Serra urged the luxury sector to get customers back through the doors instead of relying on trends. ‚Äú‚ÄòQuiet luxury‚Äô has supported average selling price at the expense of volumes,‚Äù the group wrote. ‚ÄúThe industry needs to pivot back to creativity, fashion content and newness at ‚Ç¨1-2k ($1,100-$2,200) to drive higher engagement (as it did in 2016).‚Äù And despite hopes for a turnaround in China, BofA insists that its demand will be muted on a more permanent basis. Instead, analysts expect the U.S. to come through and account for more than 50% of sector growth in 2025 with the rest of the demand comprising of global tourists and the Middle East. ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

What does it take to be a rising star on Wall Street?If our list is anything to go by, you have to be an intensely hardworking, intellectually curious team player who's willing to go the distance to drive the biggest deals, win the most sought-after clients, or build the most successful businesses. Every year, Business Insider taps its contacts to put together a list of who to watch on Wall Street. For the past seven years, we've received recommendations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and financial industry experts to create our annual feature. We ask that nominees be based in the US, be 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers to be eligible. The editors make the final decisions. These young professionals reflect the future of finance. A number of them are shaping the future of clean energy and artificial intelligence by financing the infrastructure that will underpin it. Some have seen their focus go from niche to hot asset. Others are influencing how Wall Street interacts with Main Street, using their skills and savvy to create new products and services for ordinary investors or giving employees at portfolio companies ownership stakes. Business Insider asked these rising stars from leading firms like JPMorgan, Bridgewater, and Apollo to reflect on their successes, challenges, and best career advice. One of the most memorable days of Song's KKR career was when the firm sold Minnesota Rubber and Plastics for $950 million in August 2022. She had served on the business' board while getting her MBA and led the monthslong sales process. The best part, however, was traveling to the firm's Plymouth, Minnesota, manufacturing plant to tell employees they'd be receiving a payout as equity holders in the company. Since trialing its employee-ownership program in 2015, KKR has awarded billions of dollars of equity to over 100,000 nonsenior management employees across more than 50 portfolio companies. The firm bet that giving portfolio company workers a piece of the private-equity pie would actually grow the size of the pie. Since graduating from Harvard in 2015, Song has worked on KKR's industrials portfolio team, which has been a proving ground for the employee-ownership program. She worked for four years on the firm's CHI Overhead Doors deal, which has become the case study for its employee-engagement model. All five deals she's worked on at KKR have an employee-ownership component. Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley after her family emigrated from China when she was 3, has long been a community builder. She rose through the ranks of Future Business Leaders of America in middle and high school to become the California state president before serving as copresident of Harvard's Undergraduate Women in Business program. Song, now a principal at the firm, said the feeling of community on the industrials team is one of the reasons she's stayed at KKR for nearly a decade. She said her friends and family were surprised she ended up investing in industrials, but she's become fascinated by the sector. "Everything that you can learn about in a business textbook, this role takes it to the real world, and I can see it in action here," Song said. While researching investment-banking internships in college at Emory, Cheslin contacted a family friend who invited her to visit his trading floor and experience Wall Street for herself. It was love at first sight. "I walked onto the trading floor and never looked back," Cheslin told BI. "As soon as I walked onto the floor, heard the energy, heard the noise, I was like, 'This is somewhere that I want to be.' Maybe that sounds clich√©." Today, Cheslin is a managing director in high-grade municipal trading at Wells Fargo. She joined the bank in 2012 as an analyst based in the firm's Charlotte, North Carolina, office, but later transferred to New York. She became a managing director in February. Cheslin, who's part of a team that manages billions, works with institutional clients to address their liquidity needs. She recalled an inflection point in her career in early 2022 when she was on maternity leave and the market was hit by volatility stemming from the Fed's interest-rate hikes. She recalled returning to work in what she characterized as a "completely different market landscape." But the team pulled through and logged a record year. "Knowing that I was a visible part of the effort to grow Wells Fargo's market share and to be growing our municipal franchise to be one of the top sales and trading desks on the Street is something that I'm incredibly proud of," she added. She said one key quality that's helped fuel her rise is staying open to whatever work opportunity has come her way. "Being visible not only on your desk as someone who is willing to do any task ‚Äî I think that's the mindset that I've tried to keep from analyst to managing director is that I'm never bigger than any task that I would do myself." Anton got an early start in finance, buying stocks in high school during the 2008 financial crisis. Some bets, like buying Bank of America stock at its trough, paid off. (He chalks up less-successful bets, such as one on Bear Stearns, to experience.) This introduction came in handy for his first job after college as a financial institutions group analyst at Credit Suisse's investment bank. He spent two years there and another two at Kohlberg and Company before joining Apollo in 2018. The 32-year-old principal's work runs the gamut from insurance to agriculture. He helped raise capital for Apollo's retirement services unit, Athene, by developing a fundraising strategy that allows third parties to invest alongside the firm. These funding vehicles, or "sidecars," have raised $9.3 billion in committed capital as of June 30. Anton was also Apollo's day-to-day lead on Vallourec, the French steel giant. Apollo sold its 28% stake for 955 million euros, about $1.04 billion, in March. Anton helped lead the acquisition of Vallourec during the COVID-19 pandemic and the firm's restructuring, which included moving operations from Germany to Brazil. He anticipates more opportunistic metals deals on the horizon as prices decline. Anton, who majored in history at Princeton, credits his versatility to his fondness for learning about different sectors and the successes and failures in each field. "A lot of stuff has been done before," he said. "If you have the curiosity and build up your knowledge of the past, I've found that to be really beneficial as you think about covering new sectors or moving to a new job." As Apollo courts wealthy individuals, Anton is developing new investment products that allow the firm to partially cash out quarterly or monthly in exchange for somewhat lower returns. Apollo sells about $1 billion a month in semiliquid products spanning private credit and real assets. "It's going to be a really big growth area for the firm," he said. Carper has spent his career carving out a specialty in a niche area of finance: continuation vehicles, also known as "secondaries." He helps private-equity firms raise new funds to purchase companies they already own ‚Äî giving existing investors a return while keeping the company's current management team and extending the life cycle of the asset for the PE firm. "Effectively, what we do is we help private-equity firms sell their highest-conviction, favorite portfolio companies to themselves," Carper said. He spent the first five years of his career as an investor on the buy side, including stints at Morgan Stanley and Coller Capital, before joining Lazard's private capital advisory business in 2018 and Jefferies in 2021. Earlier this year, Carper helped Vestar Capital Partners close a $1.2 billion continuation vehicle for its stake in the research company Circana. He also helped Calera Capital close a $750 million continuation vehicle for the linen and laundry service company ImageFIRST. Over Carper's career, these structures have switched from being a solution to a liquidity problem to a strategy that allows PE firms to hold on to some of their best portfolio companies and raise new capital, he said. When he entered the industry, he estimated there was less than $10 billion in continuation-vehicle volume annually. Now, there's more than $60 billion, and he thinks that will only grow. "I'm really excited to say that I think as a portion of the overall ecosystem, it's quite likely to grow," he said. "There's a lot of capital that is being formed to attack the opportunity right now." Cecil, one of two deputy chief investment officers at $108 billion Bridgewater Associates, was so ready to work full time at the firm that he dropped out of Columbia University to jump-start his career. "The thing I really liked was the intensity, the competitive nature of markets, the authenticity of Bridgewater's culture," Cecil, who first interned at the firm before joining full time in 2017, said. In his current role, he works closely with co-CIO Greg Jensen to gather insights and research from different teams and turn them into trades for the flagship strategy, Pure Alpha, which was up more than 14% through the first half of the year. "The oversight is about innovation ‚Äî what's the big thing we might be missing?" Cecil said. Reams of deep research don't go far if there's not "a trader's mentality" to actually extract "a piece of alpha" from them, he said. He said he's constantly thinking about how to make sure the portfolio is "the expression of the things we believe about the world." He was promoted to his current role at the start of this year after making his name at the firm with his research on currencies. That background has pushed him to search beyond stock and bond markets for alpha ‚Äî and to consider how different assets will work in a single portfolio. "There's a lot more room for us to think about how all these asset classes come together," he said. Being named a portfolio manager of BlackRock's Total Return Fund in 2022, alongside the managers Rick Rieder and David Rogal, was a defining moment for Chen. "Becoming a named PM ‚Äî it is incredible," Chen told BI. "I see that as a result of the ongoing contribution that I have had toward this set of funds and to the group." Chen calls herself a BlackRock lifer. She's been at the company 13 years and started out as an intern in the same fixed-income investment division she's currently in ‚Äî only now she's comanaging a total of $60 billion across BlackRock's core, core plus, and global government portfolio mandates and leading research efforts for US rates. The Total Return Fund has about $20 billion in assets. Chen grew up in China and moved to the US by herself at 17 to attend high school in Ohio. She studied economics and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and joined BlackRock full time in 2012 as an analyst focusing on US interest rates. She also had a stint as a macro researcher on the economics team. BlackRock's managing director credits her rise to the quality of her research. He said she was always willing to dig deep into the data to uncover differentiated views, which the group's leaders noticed. "The intention or the motivation for me really was wanting to turn my ideas into action and see how they play out in the market," Chen said. Her parents, who spent their entire careers in China's postal service, began working in their teens and studied part time to earn college degrees. They instilled a strong work ethic and passion for learning. "They basically immersed in me to just spend time at the library," she said. "I think my mindset of always trying to explore and trying to see more of the world came from a very young age because of that." White started his career working in franchising for Burger King, where his job was to bring on larger, better-capitalized franchisees, which usually turned out to be a PE firm or a family office. "The stories from the families and the entrepreneurs and the funds and their thesis were super interesting to me," he said. "So I decided to go to school and scale that up." After completing his MBA at Northwestern in 2017, White joined Bank of America's consumer and retail investment banking team in New York. He's since played a key role in introducing a new focus for Bank of America as part of its emerging growth and regional coverage team. "A lot of our strategy was to take all the resources and all the talent that we were putting against bulge-bracket opportunities and bring it to the middle market and try and find opportunities that normally Bank America would not have been as tuned in to," White said. He took "a leap of faith" and joined the team in Chicago in 2019. "It was kind of full circle, having started my career with entrepreneurs," said White, who now advises family-owned businesses, founders, and early investors in those companies to deepen the bank's relationships in private capital markets and attach that to its public capital markets business. Even in a time of muted IPOs, White led a large industrial IPO this year. In 2023, he was key in advising a large financial sponsor client in a take-private transaction in healthcare. He also helped lead a buy-side transaction for a family-owned consumer business, where Bank of America was both the advisor and financing partner to the client. He has advised on more than 30 transactions totaling over $25 billion. Since White joined the Chicago team, he has helped it grow from three to 25 people. His advice to young professionals in the industry is to "be your own feedback loop." "Don't wait for someone to tell you something did or didn't go well. Assess every situation yourself, almost obsessively think about, 'How can I have done that better?'" Kolwicz's parents worked in education in Warwick, New York, and though Kolwicz became an investment banker and not a teacher, he has adopted some of their characteristics. "My dad, for better or worse, anytime I asked him a question, it turned into a lesson with him," Kolwicz, a managing director in mergers and acquisitions at the elite boutique investment bank Moelis, told BI. "Sometimes, I find myself doing that a little bit too much with the people below me," he added with a laugh. "I want them to feel as invested in it from a junior level as I do from a senior level." He landed an internship at UBS in 2010 on the media and communications team. That led to a full-time job at the Swiss bank. He joined Moelis nine years ago and was elevated to the role of managing director in December. Kolwicz has advised on nearly 50 deals across various industries, collectively valued at about $125 billion. The deals span verticals from healthcare to media to energy. One of the largest deals he's advised on was last year's roughly $21 billion all-stock merger of WWE with Endeavor, the owner of Ultimate Fighting Championship. He's also been key to building Moelis' mergers business in the emerging cannabis sector. He's made a name for himself working on transactions like the $2.1 billion sale of Harvest Health & Recreation to Trulieve Cannabis Corp in 2021. The Harvest Health sale was a watershed opportunity for Kolwicz to plant his flag. He worked on the deal as an executive director before his promotion, collaborating closely with a colleague on executing the deal and presenting to the client's board every week. "The amount of experience for me to be able to do something like that" as an executive director, he said, "you don't really get it that often." Cardona approaches her often high-pressure job as a lead banker at RBC with a perspective not many on Wall Street possess. "I was illegal for 15 years of my life. I had to go through a lot of issues just getting through school," said Cardona of her move to New Jersey from Manizales, Colombia, when she was just 6 years old. "These are really big, real-world problems that I had to face on my own. So working, I would say I'm probably the most levelheaded of anyone on the team, because nothing really is that serious." Cardona worked multiple jobs to pay her way through her financial engineering degree at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. She landed a spot in RBC's 2016 summer investment-banking internship and joined the firm once she graduated. Over the past six years, she's risen from analyst to vice president. As a member of RBC's communications, media, and entertainment banking team, Cardona worked on Apollo Global Management's $5 billion acquisition of Cox Media Group in 2019, the first and largest LBO in the TV broadcasting industry. She also helped close the radio broadcasting company MediaCo's acquisition of Estrella Media earlier this year. The COVID pandemic and subsequent interest-rate hikes stalled a lot of deal flow in her coverage area, but Cardona said she has high hopes for what's in store in the next year or so. She's seeing a lot of clients and media company owners waiting for the election and interest-rate cuts to play out. She aims to be a mentor to young Latinos who aspire to go into banking. This year, she's leading a new program where she and other RBC employees will mentor 30 high schoolers from three New York City public schools. Cardona's message to other Wall Street hopefuls is to be unapologetically persistent, she said. "If I had let any doubt fill my mind in these 10 years, I would not be here. I was set up to not be here, actually." Going into energy investing was a natural choice for Stone Redding, who hails from a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth. "Growing up in Texas, you're definitely exposed to energy as an important part of the economy and the state," she said. "And the cost of energy and the form of energy are such a core part of driving the broader global economy. That was always really fascinating to me." Stone Redding started her career at Morgan Stanley's investment bank in 2013 after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin's business school. She joined TPG in 2015, working on buyouts in traditional energy such as oil and gas. She left after 2 ¬Ω years for a promotion at Warburg Pincus but returned in 2021 to work on clean-energy deals when TPG raised its Rise Climate fund, which closed in 2022 with $7.3 billion. Over the past three years, she has been involved in five deals that total about $1.5 billion in equity, per TPG. The principal helps lead North American deals in energy transition and sustainable fuels. She executed TPG's investment in the solar-tech company Nextracker, its spinoff, and its initial public offering. Nextracker now has a market cap of $5.7 billion. Stone Redding is interested in "the picks and shovels," aka the equipment-and-services providers that benefit from renewable-energy adoption but carry less risk than energy producers. In May, TPG Rise Climate acquired Olympus Terminals, a Southern California firm that stores and distributes renewable diesel fuel, for an undisclosed amount. Clean energy spans a wide range of business models from manufacturing to software. Stone Redding said setting priorities and sticking to them is the hardest part of her job. "There's a lot of exciting things to do in our space, and we have a small but mighty team," she said. Wilson is a top credit underwriter at Blue Owl Capital, overseeing nearly $5 billion in deals across some 20 transactions in her five years there. Wilson was primed early on for a life in leveraged finance thanks to some formative bonding moments with her mother over, well, bonds. She has fond memories of visiting her mom ‚Äî now retired after 25 years working in municipal bonds ‚Äî on the Deutsche Bank trading floor in Boston and playing around with the Bloomberg Terminal. This inspired a fascination with how companies operate and also a belief that women could succeed in the male-dominated finance industry. Years later, after graduating from Boston College in 2015, Wilson joined a mid-market credit firm as the only woman on a six-person investment team analyst class. "I didn't have any real reservations or qualms about joining an analyst class where I was the only woman," Wilson said. She moved to Blue Owl, then known as Owl Rock, as an associate in 2019 and quickly garnered trust and was given more responsibilities by senior leaders. She credits her success, in part, to her knack for fastidious preparation ‚Äî anticipating the critical information a busy exec may need and having concise answers at the ready. Wilson, who was promoted to vice president in January, has helped underwrite and execute loans to firms including Inspira Financial and Worldwide Clinical Trials, and in 2020, she also took a lead role in Blue Owl's small-business lending program during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided working capital to 11 borrowers. She has watched private credit's explosion into a $2 trillion market firsthand. Blue Owl's credit AUM has grown from roughly $15 billion when she joined to over $95 billion today. Even as deal sizes have ballooned ‚Äî what were once $1 billion transactions are now commonly $3 billion to $5 billion or more ‚Äî her approach hasn't. "Fundamentally, the job hasn't changed, but the scale and scope of opportunities has grown," Wilson said. Khosla was climbing mango trees at 12 years old in his native India long before he climbed the ranks of Wall Street to become a managing director at Goldman Sachs. "I am very much a proponent of luck and gratitude," Khosla said. "I mean this when I say it: Never in my wildest dreams did I assume I would be here, when you asked the 12-year-old boy." Today, Khosla leads the investment-grade financing and corporate derivatives business for healthcare and real estate within Goldman's global banking and markets unit. He works with clients on their financing needs and advises them on deal-specific risks ‚Äî like changes to interest rates ‚Äî with the goal of positioning Goldman as a "top-tier" financier to strategic clients and asset managers. Khosla said that being part of the team that rolled out Goldman's transaction-banking business, which handles cash for big corporate customers, helped distinguish him. But when asked what attribute has most contributed to his success, he pointed to the emotional ‚Äî not just the technical. "Some of my most successful transactions have been where I've really doubled down on that EQ and compassion," he said, "which is to truly get to know your clients, not just as corporations, but actually as the people that they are." It's likely a big factor in his promotion to managing director in 2019. Khosla moved to the US full time in 2006 to study at Georgetown, where he landed a gig as a bank teller at the student-run Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union. Khosla became the credit union's chief financial officer and treasurer in 2008 ‚Äî before he was even of legal drinking age. "I was the CFO of a $15 million balance sheet in the heart of the financial crisis," he said. He went on to join Goldman as an analyst in 2010. Away from work, Khosla, a married father of two, is passionate about improving education in the juvenile-justice system and sits on the board of the nonprofit BreakFree Education. When Dan joined Citadel Securities in 2022, he was given an ambitious mandate to establish the firm's presence in Japan. Dan, who was born in China and grew up in Japan, was mostly starting from scratch. Citadel Securities had neither Japanese clients nor an office in Japan, and Dan, one of the first hires on his team, worked mostly as a one-man show advising clients on their fixed-income trades. But as one of the largest foreign holders of US Treasurys with more than $1 trillion in holdings, Japan represented an untapped gold rush for Ken Griffin's market maker. Citadel Securities now has trading relationships with at least 30 top fixed-income firms in Japan, Dan said, covering nearly all the major investment firms in the country. As a senior vice president of fixed-income sales, Dan offers his perspective on the economy and market moves to Japanese banks, asset managers, pensions, and life insurance companies. From his home base in New York, he acts as a sounding board for clients' investment ideas to ultimately win more trades for Citadel Securities. Before Citadel Securities, Dan spent the prior 10 years fostering relationships with Japanese financial institutions for Deutsche Bank, where he worked on the fixed-income sales team. Becoming a part of clients' everyday routines has also helped Dan grow market share. Dan usually starts and ends his day the same way: on the phone with his clients. He gives them market updates every day over the phone; for some key clients, that's been the case for the last five years, he said. "Consistency is key. I think no matter what you do," Dan said, "do it every day so that clients remember you, and then it becomes their custom to read your comments." DiGia is a professional investor who has supported roughly $1 billion worth of investments during his time at General Atlantic. In some ways, he's also a professional taste tester. As a vice president who leads food-and-beverage investing and focuses on restaurant franchising and apparel, his love of food has become an important part of his job. "I love trying new brands and new restaurants, and the thought of working with brands that I'm a consumer of every day was really appealing," DiGia, who joined General Atlantic after spending two years as an investment banker on JPMorgan's consumer and retail team, said. "But I didn't realize how exciting the job could be on the investing side." At General Atlantic, an investment in the Austin chain Torchy's Tacos turned every fast-casual lunch into a case study, with DiGia often asking staff about the business' operations. He left General Atlantic for a short stint in 2020 to get an MBA at Stanford, though he didn't get far. He interned with his old portfolio company, European Wax Center, assisting in the chain's 2022 IPO. He now sits on the boards of Joe and the Juice, Restore Hyper Wellness, and Athletic Brewing. While DiGia's tastes might influence his investments, becoming a shareholder of Athletic Brewing actually altered them. Athletic Brewing is the top-selling beer, alcoholic or otherwise, at Whole Foods Market, DiGia said. Athletic's success and the rapid growth of the nonalcoholic beverage category, compared with a flatter trajectory for traditional beer, prompted General Atlantic to lead a $50 million equity financing. When DiGia began working on the deal, he didn't have much of an interest in nonalcoholic beer. But now, he fits them into his social life, replacing his usual drink during a work dinner. Elliott was Bank of America's top vice president globally in interest-rate sales last year, generating nearly $30 million from large hedge-fund clients ‚Äî production more in line with directors and managing directors. There's no obvious connection between Elliott's background and his ascendance in Bank of America's global markets division. How does food services and catering experience translate into elite hedge-fund sales? Elliott grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, the son of two small-business entrepreneurs. His father ran a cleaning business and his mother a catering company, which meant a tenacious approach to work "was just kind of drilled into me ‚Äî the idea of outworking everyone else in order to shine, in order to get visibility," he said. That ethic helped him earn his first internship in high school when the CEO of a food-procurement corporation saw Elliott's hustle at one of his mother's catering jobs and offered him an opportunity typically reserved for college students. Wall Street didn't emerge as a career path until the summer before his sophomore year at Duke when he attended a Bank of America diversity summit. "It was terrifying because I knew nothing about finance, but it was amazing to see senior people who looked like me could succeed on Wall Street," Elliott said. He didn't let lack of expertise discourage him from a great opportunity, studying to get up to speed after the bank offered him a summer internship. "I didn't have the most technical finance background, but I did consider myself, in most rooms I'd go into, the hardest worker." But success serving hedge funds requires savvy, not just intensity. Elliott said he treats every client meeting or dinner as if it's the most important moment of the day, and he comes armed with strategies and ideas that cut against the grain. "You don't want to be a salesperson that always agrees with the client," Elliott said. "You want to have different perspectives for them to analyze." Elliott also helps further the company diversity efforts that once helped him, including serving as recruiting cochair for Bank of America's group committed to developing and engaging African American leaders. Rooney, a sub-portfolio manager at the multistrategy hedge fund Eisler Capital, literally took an off-the-beaten-path route to his current role. While Rooney and Eisler declined to comment on this story, the 27-year-old investor told his former Citadel colleague Michael Watson about his circuitous journey to investing last year on the latter's podcast. Growing up in Ohio, Rooney said he didn't finish high school, choosing instead to bounce around jobs, including leading wilderness trips. While leading a canoeing trip in Canada, he met a college administrator who told him to get in touch if he wanted to return to school. He ended up at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied math and statistics and interned for the agriculture trading shop Louis Dreyfus. He said a senior trader told him hedge funds would try to woo him but that he should ignore their pitches for a steadier career at a place like Dreyfus ‚Äî unless it was Citadel on the other line. "I didn't even know who Citadel was at the time," Rooney, who promptly went to the firm's careers website and applied to be a commodities trader, said. Nowadays, he knows that "no 23-year-old is a portfolio manager at any hedge fund, much less Citadel." But he was hired as an associate after a long Zoom call with an agricultural trading executive at the firm and told to dive into livestock trading. He taught himself how to code in Python and added biofuels to his remit during his more than two years working for Ken Griffin before joining Eisler in October 2022. He now trades derivatives across different asset classes at Eisler's New York office but still has his wilderness experience in the back of his mind. "If there's a thunderstorm and you're in the middle of a 20-mile-wide lake, you got to get to shore," he told Watson. Rooney said it gives "you a real appreciation of the fact that random stuff can happen, and there's real risk imbued in that randomness." No workday for Williams has been the same for nearly a decade. Williams was the first hire by the activist lawyer David Rosewater for Morgan Stanley's new shareholder activism and corporate defense team in 2015. Since then, Williams has worked for General Motors as the automaker beat back proposals from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital to create two classes of stock and Bristol Myers Squibb, which came under attack from the activist Starboard Value over its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019. "I always have loved the strategic aspect of it," she said. "There is no typical theme; there is no typical evolution. Each client is different." Defense is in her blood ‚Äî her father's a retired vice admiral in the Navy, and her brother is a US Naval Academy graduate. While she considered the same path for herself, she didn't see herself becoming an officer for the long term. Instead, she gets to do "my own version of defense, in finance." "My parents tell everyone I'm still in the family defense business," she said. Her focus is on keeping Morgan Stanley's well-regarded team among the industry's leaders while also "constantly evolving." While the big-name activism campaigns and contentious proxy fights get the most headlines, she relishes working with companies on their strategies preemptively. "Every situation is incredibly unique," Williams, who has worked on hundreds of different defense strategies over the years, said. "You help them think through and plan how they can control their own destiny," she added. Zhu joined Blackstone in 2015 as the company was raising $4.5 billion for its second energy fund. Since then, Zhu has helped mentor a team that has grown to more than 30. And in the past year, he's worked on more than $2 billion in energy-transition investments. Zhu invests in assets that support renewable-energy adoption. He's worked on acquisitions of companies that will be central to upgrading the electric grid, including Blackstone's 2021 deal for Sabre Industries, which manufactures steel utility poles and towers, and its 2023 acquisition of Power Grid Components, which makes safety devices for substations. Zhu grew up with his grandparents in China, but at 17, he decided to challenge himself by applying to college in the US. He didn't speak English at the time but was accepted to the University of Guam, one of the few places that would take him without an SAT score. From there, a postgraduate business course helped him get into Duke's Fuqua School of Business. He then spent two years working in energy investment banking at BMO Capital Markets, where he realized he was more interested in working on the tangible versus the theoretical. He said he's so drawn to why things happen and the factors that make up people's lives and communities that he sometimes wonders if he should've majored in sociology or psychology. It's a big reason he enjoys working in energy transition: The real assets he helps buy can make a difference to people around the world. While he was negotiating a deal for the backup power company Trystar earlier this year, Texas experienced a catastrophic seven-day power outage. Zhu quickly saw how the company's growth could make an impact. "The benefit would be incredibly tangible and would impact a lot of lives," he said. Eid-Holm considers himself a "social nerd." The 32-year-old is a principal at Ares Infrastructure Opportunities, a $12 billion arm of the Los Angeles-based alternative asset manager Ares Management, where he focuses on digital assets, including data centers. "I'm a math person, but I also like to talk to people," Eid-Holm said. That flexibility comes in handy in a business that sits at a complicated intersection between real estate and the utility and technology industries. "Often the hardest part of getting a project off the ground is not an engineering problem; it's getting the right permits, working with the community," Eid-Holm said. Data-center development is booming, driven in large part by the proliferating need for the computing power and storage necessary to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence. Eid-Holm has helped Ares push into the asset class, including an undisclosed investment by the company in Prime Data Centers, a prominent data center developer and operator. As power has been exhausted on the grid, Eid-Holm has had to get creative. "Traditionally, the utility would build all the transmission lines and a substation next to the data center," Eid-Holm said. "We're increasingly seeing an opportunity/requirement for the developer to take on more and more of that role." Eid-Holm said he began to notice investment opportunities in the data-center space in the mid-2010s when he was a young executive at Deutsche Bank. "One deal the first year became two deals the next year became my full-time job," he said. "For me, it's been: Work very hard, and lean into good opportunities." Eid-Holm was raised in Ottawa and came to New York to work in finance after graduating from the University of Waterloo. He has a fianc√© and said he often reads books "directly or tangentially related to my job" in his free time. "I'm very passionate about what I do," he said. "I work too hard for it to be only about financial results." Gilbert's first foray into finance was a flop. "I vividly remember going into my first interview with Barclays, and I totally bombed the interview," he said. "I have joked that the interviewer pulled out his phone five minutes into the interview and was replying to work emails." But growing up as a competitive athlete, playing everything from basketball and soccer to being a double black belt in karate, Gilbert was conditioned to try to rebound from the losses. "It was, kind of, the kick in the ass that I needed in order to put my career into hyperdrive," Gilbert said. Gearing up allowed Gilbert to rise from UBS's investment bank to Summit Partners, a growth equity firm in Menlo Park, California. He's now the managing director of capital markets at Thoma Bravo, one of the world's largest technology-focused buyout firms, with some $142 billion in assets under management. Gilbert's team of six works with banks, other PE firms, and direct lenders to secure financing that enables Thoma Bravo's dealmakers to make investments. The credit can come from new investments but also from refinancing and repricing existing investments. Through his relationships with about 150 banks and direct lenders, Gilbert has led the industry with pioneering financing structures ‚Äî such as utilizing private debt markets ‚Äî to arrange more than $84 billion in total funded debt since 2018. One loan helped finance Thoma Bravo's $10.7 billion acquisition of the planning software provider Anaplan. Gilbert and the team bypassed traditional banks to secure a $2.9 billion loan from PE lenders, including Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, within eight days. This year alone, Gilbert and the capital markets team have led 25 refinancings and repricings totaling over $23 billion in transaction volumes. Those efforts have saved Thoma Bravo more than $250 million in annual interest savings across the firm's portfolio. Spending her first years at BlackRock as an analyst in its corporate mergers-and-acquisitions advisory arm gave Ding, now an infrastructure investor, a front-row seat to the firm's push into private markets. The Princeton grad joined BlackRock in 2015 after a stint at the investment firm Harding Loevner. In the years she spent on the corporate strategy team, BlackRock acquired First Reserve Corporation's energy-infrastructure investment platform and the private credit firm Tennenbaum Capital Partners. More recently, BlackRock made its biggest push into private markets, agreeing to buy Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The chance to learn where the world's largest asset manager was placing its bets was a "very compelling place to be," she said, and it ultimately convinced her to join the infrastructure business in 2019. As the head of Americas for BlackRock's infrastructure solutions unit, Ding advises on about $15 billion in capital commitments and oversees the origination, underwriting, and management of infrastructure investment opportunities in the US, Canada, and Latin America. She has directly led or co-led over $2 billion of investments, ranging from renewable energy to data-center businesses to waste-management companies. She sees a "tremendous amount of opportunity" in companies related to energy transition, security, and reliability. She also focuses on the infrastructure players set to benefit from the decarbonization of carbon-emitting industries such as transportation and waste. Her path to private markets was influenced by her mentor, the late Jerry Kenney, an advisor to BlackRock and a former Merrill Lynch executive who led the bank's expansion into investment banking. As an analyst, Ding took on side projects for Kenney, who was working on ways to grow BlackRock's alternative-investments business. Ding says she continues to raise her hand to take on extra work her team needs to succeed. "It doesn't matter if you're a director or a VP and you consider it analyst-level work," she said. "If it needs to get done to move the business or a team forward, you just do it." In two years, Alcalay has built a high-performing business in a buzzy macro strategy for the quant behemoth Two Sigma. Few hedge-fund trades have inspired more hype lately than Alcalay's niche, the lucrative basis trade, which harvests small price discrepancies from highly levered government-bond positions. "It's really hard to hire good people for that seat because, for the most part, the good people are doing really well, and their firms are clinging on to them tightly," Colin Teichholtz, a senior portfolio manager who was looking to build out a team at BlueMountain in 2018, said. He was thrilled to happen upon a young, relatively unknown trader at Barclays. Alcalay comes from an unorthodox background. He's a former information warfare officer with the US Navy, where he earned the prestigious Joint Service Commendation Medal for his work in Afghanistan. He subsequently worked with the National Security Administration, briefing senior military leaders on strategic-level threats. After leaving active duty, he joined Goldman Sachs in interest-rates trading, an uncommon career path for military veterans. But Alcalay's war-zone experience sharpened skills ‚Äî such as making sense of raw data and sources of intel and judging their limitations to draw a conclusion ‚Äî have proved well-suited to bond trading, a trader close to him said. He has the "capability to layer human intuition on top of technology," the trader said. At BlueMountain, Alcalay identified trades not just in US Treasurys but also in the European and UK markets. Alcalay covered it all and did so with poise, Teichholtz said. When panic struck the repo funding markets in 2019, he kept his cool. "He generated returns in excess of our targets with a really high Sharpe," Teichholtz said. Alcalay joined Brevan Howard two years later. In 2022, Two Sigma sought out Alcalay to build a bond basis trade strategy. His trading book has since grown substantially, and the firm continues to scale up around his strategy, people familiar with the matter said. Alcalay founded a group to support other veterans involved in trading, and he helped organize a recent networking event and panel at Two Sigma for translating a military background to quantitative finance. Portfolio manager Gnedin grew up in a family full of astrophysicists and rocket scientists ‚Äî which is part of the reason she never wanted to be one. "I guess for me, acting out was choosing the econ path," Gnedin said. The Princeton alum was inspired by her economist grandfather, the "lone black sheep" of the family who "was always the most interesting man at any dinner party," she said. But after two years as an analyst in investment banking, Gnedin, "a little bit jaded on finance," went in search of something new. In 2017, she landed a position at the largest publicly traded hedge fund, Man Group, where Gnedin has forged a path that marries her family's backgrounds. Gnedin originally joined as a quantitative researcher building algorithms for the firm's systematic investment arm, which relies on mathematical models to make investment decisions. One algorithm that Gnedin developed systematically reviewed existing model performance and identified which models should be retired. Since launching in 2019, the algorithm, one of the first of its kind at the firm, has led to about two to three models a year being dropped, she said. In 2020, Gnedin moved to the portfolio management side of the business, where she directly manages about $1.4 billion in equities in developed markets. As a quant PM, Gnedin said her job is more about managing models than specific stocks. She still spends plenty of time researching modeling techniques in old textbooks and tinkering with algorithms. When she's not nose-deep in economic research or alternative datasets, you can likely find the San Franciscan taking in the views on the Stonewall-Panoramic Trail in the East Bay with her husky. When she entered the University of Georgia, Osteen planned to pursue a career in science, but she fell in love with economics after taking an introductory course at the end of her sophomore year. After graduating in 2016, she interned at the Federal Reserve full time while studying applied economics at George Washington University. She earned her master's degree and spent another four years at the Federal Reserve as a research assistant and financial analyst. Osteen became more interested in working on Wall Street as she learned the ins and outs of stress testing and analyzed pending mergers-and-acquisition proposals from large banks. Seeking a faster-paced environment, Osteen left in 2022 to join Fidelity's asset management division as a fixed-income portfolio analyst. "Taking on challenges and trying to figure out puzzles really gets me motivated and passionate, and I feel like that is what asset management and fixed-income markets are all about," she said. "You're constantly trying to figure out and use all your resources and information to piece the puzzle together." She works with a team of three portfolio managers with about $72 billion in assets, including a low-duration bond ETF that has amassed $374 million since its February launch. In addition to her day-to-day account management work, she oversees due diligence and relationship management with bank and insurer partners for the desk's $35 billion book of stable value funds, a popular low-risk product that is guaranteed by insurers. Osteen, who had no experience in asset management before joining Fidelity, credits her swift transition to her willingness to speak up. "Not being afraid of ask questions and give your opinions and thoughts constructively is very important," she said. "It's just really being comfortable and willing to put yourself out there." At JPMorgan Asset Management, Lenihan manages $21 billion in 8,000 customizable portfolios that provide generous tax advantages for the firm's clients. He is an architect of the bank's booming Tax Smart Separately Managed Account platform, which leverages the technology of 55ip, a fintech that Lenihan helped identify for a partnership and JPMorgan then acquired. The dual role of fund manager and product developer combines his interest in finance with his engineering background. An engineer by training, Lenihan began his career monitoring the quality of suppliers' parts at Chrysler. Soon, however, he found himself thinking more about the economics of how truck and car parts played into the company's profitability than the manufacturing aspect. Hung up on these questions, and after talking to friends from the University of Michigan about their finance internships, Lenihan decided he wanted to know more about investing. He was hired into a rotational analyst program for JPMorgan's private bank, and to get closer to an investing role, he took on additional projects with portfolio managers and earned his CFA. Learning about how companies make money, why they should be financed, or their value, was "really intriguing to me," Lenihan, who also has an MBA from Wharton, said. "And as I got there, it was something that I just kind of fell in love with ‚Äî really dove in since day one." His programming skills and willingness to pitch in on different projects led to opportunities like building out the firm's robo-advisor with his mentor, Ted Dimig. Lenihan led the development of a product that required buy-in from across internal tech teams, third-party partners, and operations. "That was the genesis of a lot of my passion and love for that dual-hat role was being able to flex multiple skill sets," he said. He still dedicates time to finding fintech partners to work with or acquire. Lenihan also launched a mentoring program that seeks to build connectivity among different teams at the asset manager. "I have learned firsthand about how successful you can be with those close partnerships when you work together, " he said. Jump to

Title: Meta's SWOT analysis: AI-driven growth fuels stock optimism
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/metas-swot-analysis-aidriven-growth-fuels-stock-optimism-93CH-3638852

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been making waves in the technology sector with its strong financial performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company's recent earnings report and subsequent analyst updates have painted a picture of a tech giant poised for continued growth, despite facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Meta's second quarter of 2024 showcased impressive results, with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company reported operating income of $14.8 billion and an operating margin of 38%, exceeding analyst expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) also surpassed estimates, coming in 7% to 10% above consensus projections. Looking ahead, Meta's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 suggests continued robust performance. Analysts are projecting revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year at the high end of the company's forecast range. This optimistic outlook has led several firms to raise their price targets for Meta's stock, with some analysts setting targets as high as $660. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its substantial cash reserves of $40.7 billion, which provide ample liquidity for ongoing investments and potential acquisitions. However, Meta's increased capital expenditure (capex) guidance for 2024 and 2025 has raised some eyebrows among analysts, with projections reaching up to $51 billion for fiscal year 2025. At the heart of Meta's recent success and future prospects lies its significant investments in AI technology. The company has effectively leveraged AI to enhance user engagement across its platforms and improve advertising efficiency. Meta's AI assistant is anticipated to become the most widely used globally by the end of the year, showcasing the company's progress in this critical area. Meta's AI initiatives extend beyond user-facing applications. The company has introduced AI Studio, a tool designed to enhance business messaging and sales interactions. Additionally, over one million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features, demonstrating the rapid adoption of these technologies within the company's ecosystem. The focus on AI is not limited to short-term gains. Meta's product development pipeline includes medium-term projects centered on AI chatbots, search capabilities, and business messaging, as well as long-term investments in the metaverse concept. This multi-faceted approach to innovation positions Meta to capitalize on emerging trends in digital interaction and commerce. Meta's core business of digital advertising continues to show strength, with the company outperforming many of its peers in the sector. Global advertising demand remains robust, with online commerce being the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. The company's ability to maintain strong revenue growth, even in the face of challenging year-over-year comparisons, speaks to the effectiveness of its advertising platform. The integration of AI into Meta's advertising tools is seen as a significant driver of future growth. These AI-powered solutions are improving ad delivery efficiency and return on ad spend for marketers, potentially leading to increased advertising budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Moreover, Meta is exploring new avenues for monetization across its family of apps. The scaling of WhatsApp and the launch of Threads present opportunities for additional revenue streams, although the full monetization potential of these platforms remains to be realized. While Meta's core advertising business thrives, the company continues to invest heavily in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies. This long-term bet on the metaverse concept has been a point of contention among analysts and investors. Reality Labs is expected to see increased operating losses in 2024, reflecting the substantial investments required to develop next-generation computing platforms. However, many analysts view these expenditures as necessary for Meta to position itself at the forefront of future technological shifts. The recent showcase of Meta's holographic, AI-enabled Orion glasses prototype at the Meta Connect developer conference has reignited interest in the company's AR/VR ambitions. While still in early stages, this technology demonstrates Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive computing experiences. Meta's dominant position in social media and digital advertising provides a strong foundation for growth. The company's vast user base, with nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its services, offers a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows Meta to gather extensive data and refine its AI models, potentially widening the gap between itself and smaller competitors. However, the digital landscape remains fiercely competitive. Platforms like TikTok continue to challenge Meta for user attention, particularly among younger demographics. Additionally, tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making their own strides in AI and augmented reality, ensuring that Meta must continue to innovate to maintain its market position. Despite Meta's strong performance and positive outlook, the company faces several risks and challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent concern, with potential privacy regulations and antitrust measures posing threats to Meta's business model. The company must navigate these regulatory waters carefully to avoid significant disruptions to its operations. The substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments, could pressure profit margins in the short term. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term growth, they may impact near-term financial performance. Privacy concerns continue to be a challenge for Meta, as the company balances data collection for advertising purposes with user privacy expectations. Any missteps in this area could lead to user backlash and potential regulatory action. Lastly, macroeconomic uncertainties and potential shifts in advertiser behavior present ongoing risks to Meta's revenue growth. The company must remain agile in adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences to sustain its current trajectory. Meta's significant increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments and Reality Labs, could put pressure on the company's profit margins in the short to medium term. Analysts have noted that the projected capex for fiscal year 2025 could reach up to $51 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This elevated spending level may impact Meta's free cash flow and earnings per share growth in the near future. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term competitiveness, there is a risk that the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly or as substantially as expected. Additionally, if advertising revenue growth slows due to market saturation or economic headwinds, the high fixed costs associated with these investments could lead to margin compression. Investors will need to closely monitor Meta's ability to balance these investments with maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The company's management will be under pressure to demonstrate that these expenditures are translating into tangible benefits and future revenue streams. While Meta has shown impressive resilience in its advertising business, maintaining this growth trajectory in the face of intensifying competition presents a significant challenge. Platforms like TikTok have gained substantial market share, particularly among younger users, potentially threatening Meta's dominance in digital advertising. Moreover, changes in privacy regulations and platform policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, have made it more difficult for advertisers to target users effectively across platforms. This could lead to a shift in advertising budgets away from social media platforms like Meta's towards other channels. The company also faces competition from other tech giants investing heavily in AI and digital advertising capabilities. If Meta fails to stay ahead of the curve in terms of ad targeting efficiency and return on investment for advertisers, it could lose market share to competitors. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential shifts in consumer behavior could impact overall advertising spend, making it challenging for Meta to maintain its current growth rates. The company will need to continuously innovate its advertising products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to defend its market position and sustain revenue growth. Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence have the potential to create significant long-term value across multiple dimensions of its business. The company's focus on AI is already yielding tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and advertising efficiency. First, AI-driven improvements in content recommendation algorithms are enhancing user experiences across Meta's platforms. This increased engagement translates to more time spent on the apps, creating additional opportunities for advertising and monetization. The company's AI assistant, expected to become the most widely used globally by year-end, could open up new avenues for user interaction and data collection. Second, Meta's AI investments are revolutionizing its advertising platform. The introduction of generative AI features for advertisers is improving ad creation, targeting, and performance optimization. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could lead to higher return on ad spend for marketers, potentially increasing ad budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Third, AI is enabling Meta to explore new product categories and revenue streams. The development of AI chatbots and advanced search capabilities could position the company to compete in markets currently dominated by other tech giants. Additionally, AI-powered features in emerging platforms like WhatsApp business messaging could unlock new monetization opportunities. Lastly, Meta's long-term AI investments in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing are laying the groundwork for future innovations in augmented and virtual reality. These technologies could be crucial in realizing the company's metaverse ambitions, potentially creating entirely new markets and revenue sources. By continuing to invest heavily in AI research and development, Meta is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. If successful, these investments could lead to sustained competitive advantages, new market opportunities, and long-term value creation for shareholders. Meta's ability to monetize emerging platforms such as WhatsApp and Threads represents a significant opportunity for future revenue growth. While these platforms currently contribute minimally to the company's bottom line, their large and growing user bases present substantial monetization potential. WhatsApp, with its massive global user base, offers particularly promising prospects. The platform's business messaging features are gaining traction, with Meta reporting increased adoption by advertisers and businesses. As the company continues to develop AI-powered tools for business interactions on WhatsApp, it could unlock new revenue streams through features like automated customer service, in-app purchases, and targeted advertising. Threads, Meta's recently launched text-based conversation app, has shown rapid user adoption. While still in its early stages, Threads could evolve into a significant platform for user engagement and, eventually, advertising. The app's integration with Instagram's existing user base and Meta's advanced ad targeting capabilities could make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences. Moreover, Meta's expertise in monetizing social platforms through advertising and its vast trove of user data position it well to develop effective monetization strategies for these emerging platforms. The company's ongoing investments in AI and machine learning could further enhance its ability to deliver personalized and relevant content and ads across all its apps, including WhatsApp and Threads. Successfully monetizing these platforms could diversify Meta's revenue streams, reducing its reliance on Facebook and Instagram advertising. This diversification could provide more stable and sustainable long-term growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple for the company. However, Meta will need to carefully balance monetization efforts with user experience and privacy concerns to ensure the continued growth and engagement of these platforms. If executed successfully, the monetization of WhatsApp and Threads could represent a significant driver of future value for Meta and its shareholders.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies ‚Äî especially generative AI ‚Äî has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs. The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

The decline marked the worst day for both indices in nearly two months, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions in West Asia the Middle East and profit-booking after recent highs.

Market Performance So Far: The USD/JPY pair has been under scrutiny since Shigeru Ishiba‚Äôs election as Japan‚Äôs new prime minister, with a drop of over 400 pips reflecting the market‚Äôs anticipation of potential policy shifts. Currently, the pair appears to be in a period of consolidation after the sharp decline, with traders focusing on the 144.30 level for signs of bearish price action. The market is still digesting Ishiba‚Äôs election and its broader implications, and traders may hesitate to make moves until more concrete policy direction is provided by the new government. Meanwhile, the broader USDX is showing mixed signals, having made a new weekly low on Friday, with traders eyeing this as a potential buying opportunity. The 99.00 level is seen as a critical support zone, and if the dollar index dips to this point, it could trigger a bullish reversal, especially if market sentiment turns in favor of the USD amid perceived risks stemming from Japan‚Äôs new foreign policy initiatives. In terms of the EUR/USD, there is a strong chance the pair could drop further from its current area, with a possibility of making one final push higher before retreating. Traders looking at bullish price action around the 1.1100 or 1.1040 zones may find opportunities, but the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a decline in the near term. GBP/USD is showing a similar pattern, with the potential for the pair to either come down from its current area or make one more push higher before reversing. If it does rise, the 1.3500 level becomes a key resistance point, and bearish price action around this zone will likely set the tone for the following week. However, if the pair declines sooner, the 1.3300 level could provide a solid area for a bullish reaction, offering some short-term opportunities for traders seeking to capitalize on volatility. Lastly, gold has continued its downward movement after testing resistance at 2670, with a potential consolidation expected, and bullish price action around the 2590 area could set the stage for a rebound. What‚Äôs Happening This Week: As we head into the first week of October, several key economic data points are expected to drive market movements. On Monday, Germany‚Äôs Preliminary CPI data is forecasted to come in at 0.1%, following a previous reading of -0.1%, which could influence the EUR/USD pair. On Tuesday, the focus shifts to high-impact U.S. reports, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI, expected at 47.6, and the JOLTS Jobs Opening report, with 7.64 million jobs forecasted. A weaker-than-expected JOLTS report could fuel speculation that the U.S. job market is softening, adding pressure to the dollar. On Wednesday, the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change takes center stage, with a forecast of 124K jobs added, and traders will be watching closely to see whether the actual data meets expectations. A stronger-than-expected ADP figure could reinforce the view that the U.S. labor market remains resilient, while a weaker figure could lead to dollar weakness. On Thursday, the ISM Services PMI is forecasted at 51.6, and any data supporting a strong U.S. services sector will likely reinforce dollar strength. The end of the week brings the most closely watched reports: Friday‚Äôs Non-Farm Employment Change and the Unemployment Rate. The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data is forecasted at 144K, and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A stronger-than-expected NFP report, combined with a stable unemployment rate, could drive the dollar higher, while a weaker NFP could lead to dollar softness. Markets will likely respond with heightened volatility around Friday‚Äôs release, making it an important day for traders in dollar-denominated assets. Welspun Corp announced the receipt of order from the Middle East for supply of Coated LSAW Pipes and Bends for sour service. Shares rise 1.77% on the NSE to ‚Çπ753.60. Here is the Live event updates Market is likely to move into a consolidation phase in the near-term. One significant factor that is influencing foreign portfolios is the outperformance of the Chinese stocks which is reflected in the massive surge in the Hang Seng index by around 18 % in September. This surge has been triggered by hopes of revival in the Chinese economy in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by the Chinese authorities. The cheap valuations of Chinese stocks are keeping the momentum intact. This can prove to be a tactical trade which can sustain for some more time. This means FIIs may continue to sell in India and move some more money to better performing markets. FII selling is unlikely to impact the Indian market significantly since the massive domestic money can easily absorb whatever the FIIs are selling. Investors can use dips to buy quality largecaps which are fairly valued. Crude oil prices recovered from their lows on Friday but prices fell last week amid demand concerns and higher supply from global oil markets. As per market sources, OPEC+ will increase production by 1,80,000 barrels per day each month starting from December. The Libyan dispute has also settled and its exports could resume soon. Also, the Chinese central bank announced a cut in RRR by 50 basis points and undertook stimulus measures to revive the Chinese economy thus supporting crude oil prices at lower levels. Escalating tensions in the Middle-East are also supporting crude oil prices. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile in today‚Äôs session. Crude oil is having support at $67.55-66.90 and resistance at $69.10-69.80. In INR, crude oil has support at Rs5,630-5,570 while resistance is at Rs 5,775-5,840. Gold and silver prices rose for the third straight week in the global market after the U.S. Fed undertook big interest rate cuts in September. The dollar also weakened, which helped push prices higher. However, both metals dropped slightly from their record highs as some investors sold to book profits. Gold is nearing $2,700 per troy ounce, and silver recently hit its highest level in 11 years. Gold and silver are gaining strength because of interest rate cuts by central banks around the world, stimulus efforts from China, and rising global tensions. Gold has support at $2651-2640 while resistance is at $2684-2699. Silver has support at $31.42-31.24 while resistance is at 31.87-32.05. In INR terms, gold has support at Rs 74,750-74,570, while resistance is at Rs 75,190-75,380. Silver has support at Rs90,850-90,150, while resistance at Rs91,990-92,680.

The latest relaxation is part of slew of changes now implemented by SEBI to its existing SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations 2014. We zoom in on the prospects of Rajesh Exports, as also the prospects of two other stocks ‚Äî Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Mishtann Foods The dollar index oscillated up and down within a narrow range all through last week. The index traded in a range of 100.16-101.23. The immediate outlook is unclear. However, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release on Friday can keep the bias negative. The US 10Yr Treasury yield has declined on Friday following this data release. Here is what the charts say about the shares of Crest Ventures, Exide Industries and NMDC At current P/B multiple of 7.2 times, the price has already pulled forward many years of potential growth in net worth and the risk-reward of holding the stock at current levels is not favourable As record inflows via the SIP route continue and retail investor preference surges for mutual funds as long-term vehicles, asset management companies (AMCs) remain among the key beneficiaries. Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is the fourth largest private bank in India. Over the years, it has been a good all-round performer in all three key aspects ‚Äì balance sheet growth, asset quality and margins. However, now a host of challenges such as the embargo on the issue of new credit cards and a resultant drop in NIM, dropping CASA ratio and signs of stress in credit card accounts are stacked up for the management to overcome. Nifty 50 (26,179), the benchmark index, advanced 1.5 per cent last week. But Bank Nifty (53,834) ended the week flat as it declined on Friday, giving away the weekly gains made until then. Precious metals continued their upward march last week as well. In terms of dollars, gold and silver appreciated 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent last week and closed at $2,658 per ounce and $31.6 an ounce respectively. Crude oil prices dropped sharply last week. The Brent crude oil futures on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was down 4.3 per cent and ended the week at $71.5 per barrel. Similarly, the crude oil futures on the MCX lost 4.7 per cent as it closed the week at ‚Çπ5,694 a barrel. Effective September 30, there will be changes in the constituents of Nifty 50, Nifty Bank and Nifty Next 50. Below is the list of the stocks that come in and the ones that are being replaced.

The initial public offer (IPO) of Afcons Infrastructure, the flagship firm of Shapoorji Pallonji group, may be revised, likely upwards, with overwhelming interest coming in from institutional investors, but a decision on this is yet to be taken. While the fresh issue amounting to ‚Çπ1,250 crore that the company is raising, will remain the same, the offer for sale portion may see a revision. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have put in more money than any other category of investors in initial public offerings (IPOs) this year. FPI investments amount to ‚Çπ17,477 crore, which is 27 per cent of the ‚Çπ63,860 crore raised via IPOs this year. In comparison, domestic institutional investors (DII)-- comprising mutual funds, insurance firms, financial institutions and banks -- have invested ‚Çπ17,277 crore. Here‚Äôs an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is NLC India. The stock has been consolidating sideways now. The price action on the charts indicate that a bullish breakout is possible this week. That breakout can boost the momentum and take the share price higher in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today‚Äôs Pick to learn more. The rise to 26,200 on the #Nifty happened last week in line with our expectation. The overall picture is still positive. #Nifty can continue to rise from here in the coming weeks. Supports are there to limit the downside. Any dip from here will be limited as fresh buyers are likely to come into the market at lower levels. Global trends, trading activity of foreign investors and domestic macroeconomic data announcements would dictate terms in the equity market in a holiday-shortened week ahead, analysts said. Equity markets would remain closed on Wednesday for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. ‚ÄúLooking ahead, it will be interesting to monitor Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their flow into India. September saw the highest FII inflows into Indian equities this year. Movements in commodity prices, the US dollar index, and key macroeconomic data from the US will also be pivotal in shaping the market‚Äôs direction.

Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike‚Äôs technology was ‚Äúvalidated, tested, and certified.‚Äù The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company‚Äôs customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period.

Title: Campus Organizers Are Using Research to Expose and Oppose the Global War Machine

Full Content:
Graduate workers and student groups across the US are mapping university ties to militarism and Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza. (Photo: Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University, April 2024) The explosion of campus protest movements against Israel‚Äôs siege of Gaza, especially during the April 2024 encampments, has been historic. These movements showed the whole world that swaths of young people across the U.S. stand in solidarity with Palestinians who are facing a genocidal assault. The encampments created crises for college administrators who purport to defend values of justice and human rights while also looking to appease their trustees and donor bases who back Israel‚Äôs brutal war. A generation has been galvanized and politicized, experiencing extreme repression for simply demanding their institutions cut ties with one of the great human catastrophes of modern times: Israel‚Äôs indiscriminate destruction of Gaza, the killing of tens of thousands of people and injuring of many more, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and the annihilation of Gaza‚Äôs universities. A lesser known thread stretching across this campus upsurge has been the critical role of power research in supporting movement organizing, labor struggle, political education, and protest strategy. Across universities and colleges, grad workers and undergrad students have done the nitty-gritty work of digging into their endowment‚Äôs investments, researching the financial ties between the Pentagon and campus labs, and mapping out the connections between university trustees and the war machine. Not all this research is new. It builds on years of work by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and other campus divestment campaigns. But there‚Äôs no doubt that this moment, marked by a heightened awareness of the tight relationship between university power structures and the corporate-military-political bloc upholding occupation and apartheid against Palestinians, has generated new urgency in the longtime craft of mapping corporate power. These new research efforts that are unmasking university ties to militarism and war crimes are being carried out by union graduate workers from California to Michigan to Massachusetts who are organizing to stop the flow of their research ‚Äî their labor ‚Äî into military projects and military technology. They‚Äôre being done by undergrad organizers from New York to Rhode Island who are campaigning for divestment and building out power maps to illustrate university ties to weapons‚Äô companies. These organizers are forming research committees and working collaboratively. They‚Äôre sharing findings and skills through teach-ins and meetings. They‚Äôre building national networks and communicating across geography through group chats and webinars. These new research efforts are also drawing direct inspiration from past models of campus power research ‚Äî anti-South African apartheid campaigns of the 1980s, but especially from the 1968 pamphlet, ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?,‚Äù which mapped out the Columbia University power structure during that campus‚Äôs historic uprising against war and racism over five decades ago. Indeed, some campus researchers today are communicating with and learning directly from the veteran researchers who quite literally wrote ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?‚Äù Thus, grad workers and campus organizers for Palestine today are not merely doing research ‚Äî they‚Äôre upholding and expanding a proud movement tradition of power research that stretches back to the the civil rights movements and the SNCC Research Department and to the Vietnam antiwar movement and National Action/Research on the Military-Industrial Complex (NARMIC). In charging forward with a new and broad effort to map out university power today, grad workers and campus organizers are also reviving an analysis of the militarized corporate university that was pioneered by activists in the 1960s and 1970s. This analysis understands the university not as a site of harmonious apprenticeship, but as an employer that relies on graduate labor to function everyday and to serve the imperatives of military production; not as an idyllic site of learning, but as a power structure governed by corporate elites, interlocked with influential blocs of capital stretching from finance to real estate to technology, with close ties to the war machine and with endowments that operate like hedge funds, ready to undermine its own purported values and students at the whims of wealthy donors and war industry partners. ‚ÄúThe Beginning of the Military Supply Chain‚Äù As Israel‚Äôs siege of Gaza intensified in the fall of 2023, flattening and starving the enclave while killing tens of thousands of people, students across the U.S., from Stanford to NYU, began protesting to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and that their institutions divest from and break ties with Israel. Grad workers, as laborers within their universities, wondered how to respond. ‚ÄúA lot of the research workers and grad students here were really struggling to metabolize our grief and figure out what sort of interventions on behalf of Palestine we were positioned to make,‚Äù said Isabel Kain, a fourth-year union graduate worker in the Astronomy and Astrophysics department at at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). Specifically, Kain was thinking about the connections between her own workplace at UCSC and the war on Gaza. ‚ÄúThe research that we do can go on to create the killing machines of tomorrow,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are the very beginning of the military supply chain.‚Äù Universities are a critical part of the U.S. war machine. Billions of dollars from the Department of Defense flow annually into labs whose research findings advance weapons‚Äô systems. University endowments invest in military-tied corporations and many university trustees are interlocked with war profiteers. ‚ÄúThe U.S. military-industrial complex ‚Äúcould not function without American universities,‚Äù wrote Harry Zehner in the Nation. ‚ÄúIt needs college-educated engineers and scientists. It relies on thousands of research projects, funded by the Pentagon and carried out by academics around the country.‚Äù Moreover, it relies on thousands of graduate workers and postdoctoral fellows to carry out the research labor and lab work behind those research projects. Heeding the call of Palestinian trade unions in late 2023 to ‚Äúend all forms of complicity with Israel‚Äôs crimes,‚Äù including ‚Äúhalting the arms trade with Israel‚Äù and ‚Äúall funding and military research,‚Äù UCSC grad workers started looking toward their own workplace to take action. They weren‚Äôt the only ones. At Columbia University, some grad workers were also thinking along the same lines. ‚ÄúWe were looking at our science and saying, ‚ÄòThis is pretty messed up,‚Äô‚Äù said Kelsey Harrison, a third-year Chemistry PhD student. ‚ÄúOur government is sending weapons that are being used by Israel, and our science is contributing to advancing those weapons.‚Äù Building a National Network Toward the end of 2023, these grad workers were increasingly connecting with each other across campuses to discuss what they could do, as university workers, about Israel‚Äôs war on Palestine. This connecting was made easier because many of these grad workers were already plugged into a preexisting network of cross-campus union solidarity. The past few years have seen a historic wave of bottom-up grad worker organizing. Thousands of grad workers have unionized and gone on strike. This new campus labor militancy has been driven by militant, democratic unionism, often affiliated with left-led unions like the United Auto Workers (UAW) and United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). This organizing infrastructure, connecting grad workers from the University of California to Columbia, Michigan to MIT, laid the basis for easier communication, strategizing, and skill-sharing around Palestinian solidarity and anti-militarism work on campus. ‚ÄúNone of this is by coincidence,‚Äù said Harrison. Dozens of grad workers were already communicating through Zoom calls and group chats. There was growing interest in digging into university ties to militarism and the war on Gaza. With consciousness heightened by years of organizing, there was a sense that grad workers, given their critical role at universities and science labs, could have a big impact as workers in the Palestine solidarity movement, especially by withholding their labor. ‚ÄúWhen we saw this call to end complicity and stop arming Israel, we realized that it was graduate workers who were positioned to intervene at the very beginning of the supply chain,‚Äù said Kain. ‚ÄúIt was graduate workers who were positioned to cut the flow of labor and expertise and work going into the military industrial complex that will flow on to harm Palestinians.‚Äù ‚ÄúPalestine is absolutely a workplace issue,‚Äù she said. With interest growing, some suggested that grad workers meet more concertedly to dig into their university‚Äôs connections to the catastrophe in Gaza and to U.S. militarism. As workers embedded in the military supply chain, they could use the research into these ties to help identify points of leverage to disrupt the war machine. A new network, Researchers Against War (RAW), was born out of this moment. Going into 2024, RAW held zoom meetings that brought together grad workers across the U.S. Mike Locker, a co-author of the original 1968 pamphlet ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?,‚Äù offered guidance on the ties between universities and militarism and how power research could support their organizing. Out of all this, grad workers were feeling galvanized to look deeper into their employers ‚Äî their universities and labs ‚Äî to support Palestine and challenge the larger military-industrial complex. ‚ÄúResearching Like Mad‚Äù Emboldened and connected, grad workers were starting to map out their institutions‚Äô ties to the war machine, supporting each other by sharing research tips and organizing advice. At UCSC, around ten grad workers began ‚Äúresearching like mad for a couple of months,‚Äù said Kain, mapping the flows of money from the Department of Defense to UCSC and University of California system. They dug into public records of federal grants, mined sites like USASpending.gov, followed grant numbers tied to specific labs, and looked at the school‚Äôs Office of Sponsored Projects. Kain said that in 2023 the University of California system received $333 million of Department of Defense basic research funding that flowed into a range of labs across campuses. At UCSC specifically, they found 18 labs with active Department of Defense contracts and 10 labs with recently expired DoD contracts. They identified areas of potential ‚Äúresearch misuse,‚Äù as Kain put it, meaning ‚Äúclearly weaponizable stuff.‚Äù UCSC grad workers used these findings to organize within their departments. ‚ÄúIt was really this funding research that unlocked the possibility of talking to our coworkers,‚Äù said Kain. In January 2024, nearly three dozen UCSC astronomers penned a collective letter that stated their commitments to ‚Äúdemilitarizing‚Äù their research, with specific demands like ‚Äúwithholding academic labor benefiting militarism‚Äù and ‚Äúrefusing research collaboration with federal military institutions as well as private arms and defense companies.‚Äù In exchange for millions of Pentagon funding, said the letter, ‚Äúthe products of our research lubricate the churning gears of the war machine.‚Äù The letter made direct connections between labor performed at UCSC and the genocide in Palestine and called ‚Äúon all academic workers everywhere ‚Äì graduate students, postdocs, lecturers, faculty ‚Äì to divest their labor from apartheid, genocide, and militarism.‚Äù The UCSC astrophysics letter was an inspiring model to a core of Columbia grad workers who had also started to explore their school‚Äôs ties to weapons‚Äô companies. They discovered that a ‚Äúhuge amount‚Äù of Defense Department funding went into basic research at research institutions. In 2021, Columbia received over $49 million in research and development funding from the Defense Department, the 28th most in the nation. A snapshot from Columbia grad workers‚Äô research into Pentagon lab funding at Columbia. With this research, they started putting together a chart that tied Pentagon funding to specific research projects at Columbia. Like UCSC, Columbia grad workers used their research to support organizing within their departments, holding one-on-one conversations with fellow grad workers. The research was a ‚Äúgreat way to bring people in,‚Äù said Harrison. ‚ÄúA lot of people cared about Palestine but didn‚Äôt know what to do about it. This is a very concrete way that they can start to look into their own position and role and how they‚Äôre contributing to the military.‚Äù Teach-Ins and Research Committees Meanwhile, RAW was working to expand the national effort among grad workers to challenge, as higher ed laborers, the flow of their labor into military production and campus ties to militarism. On February 12, RAW hosted a national teach-in and organizing discussion over Zoom, titled ‚ÄúDemilitarizing Research from Vietnam to Palestine,‚Äù where dozens of attendees heard from grad workers and post-docs who had started to map and organize around their schools‚Äô Pentagon ties. Teach-in attendees also heard from veterans of the 1960s and 1970s like Mike Locker, who recalled how the Vietnam antiwar movement used power research to protest against campus ties to the war machine. Along the way, grad workers at individual campuses continued to push the movement locally. Columbia RAW members spoke at the Columbia encampment on April 19, where they also passed out a RAW brochure. From the Researchers Against War (RAW) brochure A few days later, on April 22, Columbia RAW and Science for the People, a group dedicated to demilitarizing science research, held a joint campus teach-in at Columbia on the movement for antiwar STEM research. Columbia RAW gave a presentation, ‚ÄúTowards Anti-War STEM Research,‚Äù that laid out in painstaking detail the ties between the Defense Department and university research labs. A slide from Columbia RAW‚Äôs teach-in presentation, ‚ÄúTowards Anti-War STEM Research.‚Äù Other campuses were also plugging into the national research network. At the University of Michigan, grad workers with the Graduate Employees‚Äô Organization (GEO) were among the several campus efforts to hold a ‚Äúwatch party‚Äù for RAW‚Äôs February 12 teach-in. GEO had started a Palestine solidarity working group as part of the union‚Äôs Solidarity and Political Action Committee. The working group had different arms, including a research team. Grad researchers started to ‚Äúmap labs around campus,‚Äù said Nathan Kim, a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information, and ‚Äúbasically try to determine what different sources of funding they were getting.‚Äù With those research findings, they‚Äôd use an ‚Äúorganizing approach,‚Äù Kim said ‚Äî for example, talking to students about Project Nimbus when they discovered funding from Google. They hoped to ‚Äúpoliticize what it means to do research,‚Äù said Kim, and organize grad workers to refuse Pentagon funding. This ‚Äúlab tracker research‚Äù was one wing of their larger research efforts; endowment research and research into the University of Michigan‚Äôs affiliations with pro-Israel institutions such as the Michigan-Israel Partnership were others. Part of the zine on the UMichigan endowment that researchers and comms organizers put together. After the TAHRIR Coalition formed at the University of Michigan in November 2023, GEO grad workers continued to do research as different efforts across the campus gravitated together, and GEO and its research team soon became part of the broader campus-wide TAHRIR project. Power Research and the Columbia Encampment As in 1968, students at Columbia University in 2024 made a breakthrough for the wider campus movement when their April 2024 encampment ‚Äî and the repression against it ‚Äî galvanized the nation. Power research played a role in informing the encampment‚Äôs demands and messaging. In October 2023, Columbia students reactivated Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which formed in 2016 but had since become inactive, and formed different CUAD subcommittees, including a research committee. In late 2023 the coalition submitted a lengthy divestment proposal to Columbia‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing (it was rejected). With the April 2024 encampmentent taking off, the research committee put together a tabling pamphlet that contained a power map of university ties to Israeli occupation, apartheid and genocide. It showed how university trustees were tied to war profiteering. From the tabling pamphlet compiled by the CUAD research committee at Columbia Trustee Jeh Johnson, for example, is a board director of Lockheed Martin, a major weapons supplier to Israel. It also showed how the Columbia University Investment Company, which oversees CU‚Äôs endowment, invests in companies like Google and Microsoft, and in the funds of asset management giant BlackRock, who all bolster Israel‚Äôs ongoing oppression of Palestinans. From the tabling pamphlet compiled by the CUAD research committee at Columbia A Columbia undergraduate and CUAD member who was involved in making the power map, and who asked that their name be withheld, said the map‚Äôs creation was very much a ‚Äúcommunal process.‚Äù It started with a scribbled rough draft on paper. The draft was based on researchers‚Äô findings. Out of this, someone used a computer program to create the finished map that was used in the pamphlet. The power map and the brochure were created for specific organizing purposes. Organizers wanted to make accessible for students the material connections between Columbia and Palestine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessarily clear to an ordinary college student how they have a direct and personal connection to the genocide,‚Äù said the Columbia undergraduate. ‚ÄúThe brochure was the best way to lay out our understanding of that connection in a direct way,‚Äù conveying ‚Äúhow we felt and what we learned from our research inside CUAD,‚Äù they said. The pamphlet made transparent and concrete what the encampment was demanding. ‚ÄúIt showed that students were fighting for divestment from these primary companies, and why,‚Äù said the Columbia undergraduate. The research into the Columbia University power structure also informed protest strategy. This included choosing specific trustees to protest. ‚ÄúOur research allows us to pick the best possible target and have the most direct justification for our action,‚Äù they said. Organizing and Research Across Other Campuses Research and power mapping played important roles within a range of other university protests as well. University of California organizers mapped out the UC Board of Regents and named certain investments tied to Israel. Organizers at the University of Massachusetts laid out their ties to weapons producer Raytheon. At Emory University, organizers focused on the role of Motorola‚Äôs surveillance technology from Atlanta to Palestine. Researchers at the University of Michigan compiled a thorough report on their endowment, handed out divestment flyers, and used power research to agitate on social media around the Board of Regents and endowment. Brown University did not have an umbrella coalition like CUAD at Columbia or TAHRIR at Michigan, but different groups came together to engage in direct actions, a hunger strike, and an encampment. Palestine solidarity work at Brown has drawn on inspiring precedents of campus divestment campaigns against South African apartheid in the 1980s. The current upsurge has also built on organizing and research from the past few years. In 2020, a student divestment vote created the Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies (ACCRIP), which issued a report, compiled by a group of faculty, grad students, and undergrads, arguing that Brown‚Äôs own ESG standards Brown should divest from companies that ‚Äúfacilitate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territory.‚Äù Because of all this, said Brown senior Kian Braulik, there was already ‚Äúa broad base of support for divestment‚Äù that ‚Äúwas really democratic‚Äù when students started organizing to oppose Israel‚Äôs siege of Gaza. Braulik said a group of researchers from different campus groups collaboratively revised that report, extending it from the original 16 pages to over 50 pages, adding new graphic designing to make it look catchier. During the encampment, they handed out copies of the report to show people why they were protesting and what their demands were around divestment. Cover of the longer updated 2024 edition of recommending Brown divest from Israeli occupation Campus organizers also made flyers of ten companies they want Brown to divest from, including Safariland, Boeing, General Dynamics, RTX (formerly Raytheon) and others, with explanations why. All this research and mapping informed the demands at Brown, said Braulik, including their decision to protest Maria Zuber, a Brown trustee who also sits on the board of Textron, a military contractor headquartered in Providence that provides Israel with weapons. Textron, headquartered in Providence, was one company that the Brown University movement highlighted. Organizers at Yale University also made use of power research. Taran Samarth, a second-year PhD student in political science, notes that power research has ‚Äúdeep roots‚Äù in New Haven and Yale. Grad workers affiliated with Local 33 Unite Here have used power research to support their organizing, while Fossil Free Yale imparted critical help for campus Palestine organizers. Samarth said the organizers who had done fossil finance research were ‚Äúreally helpful‚Äù in supporting Yale‚Äôs Palestinian solidarity movement and that ‚Äúthose same skills‚Äù were deployed to ‚Äúthinking about Palestine and about the genocide.‚Äù Samarth said there hadn‚Äôt previously been much focus among Palestinian solidarity activists on Yale‚Äôs investments. ‚ÄúIf people said divestment, it was sort of a gesture,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt really know what the connections were because no one had really done the work to investigate them.‚Äù Yale organizers stepped up that research in October 2023, as campus actions started taking off. In November, an anonymous zine was distributed that named specific connections between Yale and Israel‚Äôs war on Palestine through Yale‚Äôs investments, while the Yale Endowment Justice Coalition campaigned around Yale‚Äôs investments in weapons‚Äô companies through ETF funds. Page from anonymous zine on Yale‚Äôs endowment‚Äôs ties, ‚ÄúYale is Complicit.‚Äù ‚ÄúPower research was a really key part of demand-making and orienting the campus movement early on,‚Äù said Samarth. The following months saw direct action protests, teach-ins, and the encampment, all which focused on divestment demands that research helped to clarify. Samarth also says that that power research helped students develop a deeper understanding of the corporate university. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this whole broader problem of the university and its relationships with New Haven and the world,‚Äù they said.‚Äù From the ‚ÄúYale Corp, Divest from War‚Äù pamphlet, distributed at the Beinecke Plaza occupation and encampment at Yale in the Spring of 2024. And while these campus movements played out locally, they were also stitched together through national networks and coalitions. For example, Kim at University of Michigan, Braulik and Brown, and Samarth at Yale were among the researchers who connected to form the Endowment Justice Research Network (EJRN). ‚ÄúWe were just trying to get people working on similar things together to talk to each other and develop methods together,‚Äù said Kim. Kim went to conferences like Labor Notes and the People‚Äôs Conference for Palestine in Detroit and passed out half sheets with QR codes to grow the network or recruited by word of mouth. This past summer, EJRN co-hosted a webinar with LittleSis on endowment research. ‚ÄúOne goal of the EJRN is to identify some shared connections across universities,‚Äù said Kim. ‚ÄúFinding points where we can mobilize a shared campaign would be awesome, and that‚Äôs one goal for the future that we have.‚Äù 1968‚Äôs ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?‚Äù Inspires a New Generation When grad workers and campus organizers started researching and power mapping their universities‚Äô ties to militarism, they didn‚Äôt do this in a historical vacuum. This new organizing wave drew inspiration from campus divestment movements against South African apartheid from the 1980s, and, especially, from power research efforts five decades earlier in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968, Columbia students waged a historic protest on campus against the university‚Äôs connections to racism and the war in Vietnam. Out of this, a small group of researchers produced a powerful pamphlet, ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?,‚Äù that mapped out and analyzed the university‚Äôs power structure and its deep ties to the war machine and corporate interests. ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?‚Äù showed that universities were deeply interlocked with society‚Äôs larger corporate power structure and ruling elite. The same forces and interests dominating national politics and economic decision-making ‚Äî real estate, Wall Street, the military industrial complex ‚Äî also occupied the governing heights of university power. For grad workers at Columbia organizing around Palestine, ‚ÄúWho Rules Colombia?‚Äù was an inspiration. ‚ÄúReading it showed me what is possible,‚Äù said Harrison. Nor were they just abstractly inspired by ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?‚Äù They were mentored by and worked closely with Mike Locker, a seasoned power researcher who was one of the original authors of the original pamphlet in 1968. Locker joined Researchers Against War meetings and Columbia grads soon connected with him directly. They started having regular breakfasts with him where they would absorb lessons from Locker‚Äôs years of experience doing power research. We would ‚Äújust sit down and talk and ask each other questions and check in,‚Äù said one Columbia grad worker in chemistry, who asked that their name be withheld. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs able to apply his strategies from the 1960s to current times. It‚Äôs just been incredible, not only for information and resources, but also for inspiration.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho Rules Columbia?‚Äù tweeted out by one grad worker during the April 2024 encampment wave Kim said the research group at University of Michigan read Who Rules Columbia? and that the pamphlet ‚Äúchanged our campaign‚Äù by focusing attention on the university as a larger power structure, such as ‚Äúthe people controlling the endowment‚Äù and ‚Äúthe backgrounds of the regents.‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄòWho Rules Colombia?‚Äô made us realize that what‚Äôs most important and useful to us is not just understanding what the endowment is invested in,‚Äù said Kim, ‚Äúbut the networks of power around the university that control things at large.‚Äù Because of this, University of Michigan organizers started new research projects, including a dossier on the Board of Regents. Kim also took inspiration from Locker ‚Äî a University of Michigan alum ‚Äî when the power research veteran joined the debut Researchers Against War teach-in that included grad workers from across universities. ‚ÄúHe talked about his own experiences, both at Columbia and the University of Michigan,‚Äù said Kim. ‚ÄúThat was super helpful for us.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt just the mentoring and support from Locker that inspired the Columbia grad workers who met with him. It was also his personal example as someone who has dedicated his life to the movement. ‚ÄúTo see people who had been committed in 1968, in their youth, and who are still committed,‚Äù was deeply inspiring for the Columbia grad worker who asked that their name be withheld. ‚ÄúIt really grounds you in the fact that this is a lifelong commitment and that it‚Äôs possible to lead a life that is guided by your values.‚Äù * * * The current campus movements for Palestine illustrate the usefulness of power research for supporting organizing efforts. The deeper ties between universities and militarism are not necessarily apparent, but research and mapping can help uncover and illustrate these connections. Doing so helps educate movements, offering a clearer sense of what they‚Äôre up against, and making more transparent how universities are both power structures within themselves as well as crucial components of the wider corporate and militarist power structure. Understanding these interlocks and connections opens up new strategic and tactical possibilities for organizers. Moreover, the very process of doing the research can be an organizing tool: a collective endeavor that builds cohesion, consciousness and solidarity. Critically, it‚Äôs important to remember that power research is not an end in itself, but rather a tool that serves organizing efforts and, often, can strengthen them ‚Äî whether that be for grad workers making clearer sense of their relationship to the military supply chain and how to disrupt it, or campus groups seeking to better understand and communicate their institution‚Äôs ties to the war machine and identify focuses for protest actions. University power ‚Äî elite-managed, corporate-tied, military-aligned, ultimately repressive ‚Äî has been unmasked for a new generation of students. RAW is still meeting regularly and drawing from grad workers in the sciences, engineering and humanities. Campus groups are retooling their efforts to challenge university ties to militarism. As a new semester takes off; as Israel‚Äôs monstrous war against Palestinians continues, fully backed by the U.S. and its military industry; and as the corporate university shows no signs of abating, we may be seeing just the beginning of a new wave of power research and mapping of campus power structures ‚Äî and beyond.

Title: Why The Ether ETF Has Underperformed Versus Bitcoin
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/29/why-the-ether-etf-has-underperformed-versus-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:19:23Z

Ether continues to grow but price levels remain subdued When the SEC announced it had approved multiple spot ether ETF products in July 2024 market sentiment was almost universally supportive and encouraged by this action. Following years of stymying efforts by industry advocates and operators to create and trade spot ETFs, the two largest cryptocurrencies ‚Äì bitcoin and ether ‚Äì had received ETF approval within the same year. In stark contrast to the dramatic increase in price that bitcoin experienced, the majority of which has remined intact even as headline volatility has continued to increase, the price response to the ether ETF was muted. Even more interestingly the trading volumes and institutional appetite for these ETF products has also remained more lower than the spot bitcoin ETF and/or market forecasts. Highlighting this sluggish beginning are the outflows that have been occurring from the ether ETF products, capped by a nearly $80 million outflow on a single Monday, which was the highest since a $98 million outflow figure in July 2024. While bitcoin has increased over 50% in 2024 (since the launch of spot ETF products), ether has only climbed approximately 15% and has yet to surpass the previous all-time-highs last achieved in 2021. From whichever metric is analyzed the launch of spot ether ETFs has fallen flat when compared to spot bitcoin ETFs. Let‚Äôs take a look at a few of the reasons why, despite serving as the blockchain of choice for many Layer 2 applications, the ether ETF has gotten off to a slow start. Even though the cryptoasset space has expanded dramatically in just the last several years, the reality remains that in most media and institutional conversations, bitcoin is still the unquestioned leader. This can be observed either through anecdotally observing business media coverage and corporate announcements, and by watching the actions of TradFi institutions and nation-states alike. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions in investment while sending the price of bitcoin up substantially, while corporate purchasers such as Microstrategy continue to focus on exclusively purchasing bitcoin. Larry Fink and Blackrock have issued public facing documents touting the appeal and upside of bitcoin, and nations such as El Salvador and more recently Bhutan have amassed stockpiles of bitcoin. Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto landscape, as well as the dollars that are being allocated by larger institutional investors. As multi-faceted as the crypto landscape continues to be, the narrative and messaging around bitcoin has remained uniquely consistent since inception. From being labeled as digital gold, or a store or value, or the money of the future the narratives around bitcoin have remained steadfast. Even if the specifics of these narratives, or how well they manifest in the market, investors and regulators alike have become familiar with them to base decision making around these frameworks. This consistency has manifested itself even bitcoin is famously decentralized, has no identified creator, nor does the cryptocurrency have any sort of governing body. Ether on the other hand, has seemingly struggled to find a message and/or narrative that is consistent enough, simple enough, or intuitive enough to be seized by mainstream investors. Even though the Ethereum blockchain and the ether token serves as the base layer for many of the enterprise applications that are driving the investment dollars into crypto, the presentation of Ethereum as the internet of the future or other amorphous value propositions have proven difficult for institutional investors to get behind. Last but certainly not least is the reality that, and directly connected to the primary value proposition of Ethereum and ether at large is the fact that ether is perhaps the token most susceptible to the crypto price paradox. Ether serves as the currency of choice for most of the Layer 2 applications that are driving enterprise adoption; stablecoins, DeFi, DAOs, and even NFTs all (for the most part) run and rely on ether. Even with improvements made via various upgrades ‚Äì which have substantially increased capacity and reduced cost ‚Äì the fact remains that pricing services in ether will have exercise downward pressure on a price-per-token basis. Put simply any token, be it ether or otherwise, that simultaneously serves as a potential medium of exchange and investment asset (via spot ETFs), is going to need to obtain a medium satisfactory to both interested parties. Given the muted price action of ether following the approval and launch of spot ether ETFs, and the preference of institutions and governments to select bitcoin above other cryptoassets, and it appears that this paradox will continue to exercise influence for the foreseeable future. Crypto ETFs have been a positive development for the sector, but not all such instruments deliver equally positive returns. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Fortune Swells To Over $200 Billion‚ÄîThe Metaverse Masterstroke
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/mark-zuckerbergs-fortune-swells-to-201-billion/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:00:26Z

The trek into the metaverse for Mark Zuckerberg has been anything but smooth. His once-risky bet, which cost him more than $100 billion, appears to be paying off handsomely now. His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge. Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk. Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it. Some doubters think Meta‚Äôs performance produced more loses than advantages. Some critics have argued that Zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune has been less in the metaverse concept itself than in his endeavors to benefit from recent AI leaps. Interestingly, Meta made huge financial stabilization efforts. This includes the initiation of its $50 billion share buyback program and also reduced 25% of its workforce for the sake of streamlining the organization. Zuckerberg continued to support the metaverse despite financial issues. He passionately discussed integrating the actual and virtual worlds at recent events, envisioning a period when people communicate via holograms or avatars. Nonetheless, a few shareholders and insiders are advising caution. They‚Äôve voiced reservations about investing further funds in what many consider to be a project that is still a long way from becoming widely accepted. Furthermore, there‚Äôs a growing belief that Zuckerberg ought to focus on Meta‚Äôs main applications, which generate almost all of the company‚Äôs income: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As the tech sector gets more competitive‚Äîespecially with rivals like Google and Amazon making major advances in artificial intelligence‚Äî Zuckerberg might wish to rethink his goals. As Meta continues to introduce fresh goods, such as the Quest 3 VR helmet and Ray-Ban smart glasses, these innovations should eventually help the business to increase its income. Still, many investors who would rather see gains sooner rather than later harbor great skepticism. Future prosperity of the company will depend critically on its capacity to include fresh technologies into its current systems.

Full Content:
Clontarf and Young Munster are the only unbeaten sides in Division 1A after just two rounds of the Energia All-Ireland League which indicates this may well be a particularly competitive campaign in the top flight. Young Munster beat Terenure for the fourth year running at Tom Clifford Park with a thrilling 34-30 victory in which the lead exchanged five times. When Harrison Brewer finished off the try of the match early in the second half and Aran Egan converted they led 22-14, but Munsters responded with a fine try by winger Hubert Gilvarry, which dead-eyed Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski converted from the touchline. After Leszczynski and Egan exchanged penalties, the former then converted a try by Manuel Covella before Egan failed to convert his own try. Leszczynski kicked a penalty before Munsters withheld another siege on their line. Clontarf lead on 10 points courtesy of a second bonus-point win by 29-21 at home to Garryowen courtesy of tries by Dylan Donnellan, inevitably, Tadhg Bird, Louis O‚ÄôReilly and Seni Reilly Ashiru. It was the first time that Keith Wood‚Äôs three sons ‚Äì Gordon, Tom and Alex ‚Äì played together for Garryowen, but although Gordon was on the scoresheet again the Limerick club were unfortunate to emerge with no tangible reward. Defending champions Cork Constitution returned to winning ways with a thumping 51-21 win over Ballynahinch, their Munster fullback Scott Buckley scoring two of their tries. Newly promoted St Mary‚Äôs moved up to third in the table with a 32-22 bonus-point away to City of Armagh, while Lansdowne beat UCD 25-10. Similarly in 1B, Nenagh Ormond, with winger Conor McMahon contributing 23 points, and Old Belvedere recorded statement bonus-point wins away to Blackrock and Trinity to emerge as the only two sides in the second tier with two wins from two. There were four high-scoring home wins in 2A, Barnhall leading the way with 11 tries against Buccaneers, while Navan‚Äôs first home game in their centenary season was a 22-22 draw with Old Crescent. Division 1A: City of Armagh 22 St Mary‚Äôs College 32; Clontarf 29 Garryowen 21; Cork Constitution 51 Ballynahinch 21; Lansdowne 25 UCD 10; Young Munster 34 Terenure College 30. Division 1B: Blackrock College 36 Nenagh Ormond 38; Dublin University 19 Old Belvedere 43; Naas 61 Queens 21; Shannon 23 Old Wesley 13; UCC 39 Highfield 14.

Title: BlackRock Dismisses Bitcoin‚Äôs Risk Label, Calls It A Smart Investor Play

BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, is currently generating significant interest within the investment community with its most recent report, ‚ÄúBitcoin: A Unique Diversifier.‚Äù This document emphasizes the potential of Bitcoin as a unique asset class that can improve portfolio diversification. BlackRock manages assets valued over $10 trillion, therefore their advice is quite important. The company contends that the distinctive features of Bitcoin, such as its distributed nature and fixed number, set it apart from other conventional financial assets. BlackRock‚Äôs effectively launched Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) currently boasts holdings of around $21 billion. Originally introduced earlier this year, the ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has drawn a lot of investor interest. Actually, the fund has garnered more than $14 billion in assets, which demonstrate growing conviction in Bitcoin as a lucrative choice of investment. BlackRock‚Äôs research shows that Bitcoin behaves quite differently than traditional risk assets. The company notes that Bitcoin has shown significant volatility, but it insists that its long-term performance is mostly unaffected by other financial markets. For example, bitcoin is up 22% since August 5 when the Yen carry trade was unwound, while gold and the S&P 500 have only risen modestly around 11%. This could suggest that bitcoin has the capability of working in isolation of regular market changes, which therefore makes it a rather compelling choice for investors who would wish to achieve certainties in their investing. The report also underscores the fact that a significant number of Bitcoin holders are experiencing profits. According to data, the majority of investors who have maintained their Bitcoin investments for three years or longer are currently profitable. This trend indicates that there is a growing consensus among investors that Bitcoin can function as a secure refuge during periods of economic instability. More individuals are turning to Bitcoin as a potential store of value as geopolitical tensions increase and trust in traditional financial institutions diminishes. What‚Äôs remarkable is how reflective of an institutional investor shift toward cryptocurrencies in general BlackRock‚Äôs posture has been. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once was skeptical of digital assets, but has since realized that his skepticism toward Bitcoin was actually ‚Äúmisguided.‚Äù This is characteristic of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial organizations. As the institutions are increasing their adoption of Bitcoin, its credibility and acceptance rate will increase with the entry of institutions like BlackRock, which will push it into the mainstream. Another interesting question is whether Bitcoin is a risk-on or risk-off asset. Its near-term trading patterns appear to lean toward risk-on behavior, but long-term data paints another story.

By David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 54, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you‚Äôre new here, welcome, so psyched you found us, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.) This week, I‚Äôve been reading about AI slop and sports betting and Jony Ive, clearing my schedule for the new season of The Great British Bake Off, watching Sicario and Pirates of the Caribbean and A Quiet Place: Day One on plane-seat screens like their directors intended, insta-subscribing to Hasan Minhaj‚Äôs new YouTube show, and just relentlessly trolling people with Vergecast clips through Pocket Casts‚Äô new feature. I also have for you a couple of new Meta gadgets, the mobile game that will eat up all your free time, a couple of hotly anticipated new movies, the best Spotify feature in forever, and much more. So much going on! Let‚Äôs dig in. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be reading / watching / playing / trying / building out of clay this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.) / A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge‚Äôs universe. Fun fact: Joanna Stern is the main reason I ever got a job at The Verge in the first place. (That story is long and, if I remember correctly, involves her playing a fairy in a video? But I promised her I wouldn‚Äôt tell that story.) These days, she‚Äôs a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, an Emmy winner, and most recently, the creator of Joannabot, the AI chatbot that will tell you everything you need to know about the iPhone 16. (And apparently also do some other things, if you‚Äôre clever enough, but again, we‚Äôll leave that alone.) I asked Joanna to share her homescreen because she just reviewed the iPhone 16, which means she just had to set up a homescreen. And because she‚Äôs forever using new gadgets and switching between things, I was curious what always made it to the top of the pile. Here‚Äôs Joanna‚Äôs homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: I‚Äôm submitting my homescreen and my Control Center screen because I‚Äôm proud of the work I did on the Control Center. I may submit it for an award. But really, I‚Äôd like to just use this as a forum to complain about the all-in-one connectivity widget in the new Control Center in iOS 18. I don‚Äôt like it. I like the single buttons so I can easily just turn them on and off or long-press to get in there. Sadly, they have gotten rid of the single Wi-Fi button, but I read on this great website that it‚Äôs coming back in iOS 18.1. The phone: iPhone 16 Pro Max. The wallpaper: This is my dog Browser. It isn‚Äôt the best shot of him, but the framing is nice for putting him in the middle of the screen. My lockscreen wallpaper is this awesome retro iPod made by a designer named Shane Levine. I bought it through this site last year after featuring it in my newsletter. The apps: WSJ, ChatGPT, Apple Notes, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Instagram, YouTube, Clock, Threads, Signal, Photos, Slack, Spotify, Phone, Safari, Messages, Gmail. My apps are so basic and make me feel so basic. I work (Slack, Gmail). I message (Messages, Signal). I listen and watch things (YouTube, Spotify). I social media (Threads, Instagram). I work more (Google Docs, WSJ). If it isn‚Äôt on this main homescreen, I usually just search for it. Before iOS 18, I had a widget stack on the homescreen with weather and time zone widgets, but I moved it off to another screen. I might move it back. I might not. Got to live a little. I also asked Joanna to share a few things she‚Äôs into right now. Here‚Äôs what she shared: Here‚Äôs what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you‚Äôre into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal ‚Äî @davidpierce.11 ‚Äî with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we‚Äôll feature some of our favorites here every week. And for even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads. ‚ÄúSliding Seas. It‚Äôs a match-three (or four!) game but also so much more: there‚Äôs real strategy required behind your moves to beat levels at the higher end, but it‚Äôs never unfair, and while there are in-app purchases and power-ups you can buy to make a level easier, you crucially never need to. It is the most compelling and well-suited-to-mobile game I‚Äôve ever found and a gem I recommend without reservation.‚Äù ‚Äì Jamie ‚ÄúGisnep is another daily puzzle game, this time by David Friedman of Ironic Sans. It appears as a crossword-esque grid, but the words only go across and wrap around. The goal is to reveal both a quote and the source by filling in letters from vertical columns. I‚Äôve gotten a number of my friends hooked already.‚Äù ‚Äì Kyle ‚ÄúSatisfactory 1.0 launched a week ago or so. A great group of devs have effectively made a game that feels like work but is fun. If you love conveyor belts and staying up all night, this might be for you.‚Äù ‚Äì Matt ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt mentioned switching to OmniFocus! As a fellow perennial ‚Äòtask manager switcher,‚Äô this app is a staple in my rotation.‚Äù ‚Äì Pedro ‚ÄúI previously recommended App in the Air as a great travel companion, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs shutting down. If you‚Äôre looking for an alternative, Flighty is excellent, especially for travel stats, and they‚Äôre building an importer for App in the Air users.‚Äù ‚Äì Vivian ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been watching English Teacher on FX. Constant laughs and, so far, each episode has been better than the last. Easily one of the funniest shows on TV right now.‚Äù ‚Äì Danial ‚ÄúI was gifted the Humanscale FR300 Ergonomic Foot Rocker, which is a very tech-sounding name for a very manual / mechanical rocking footrest. It‚Äôs very pleasant to use. I‚Äôve also been standing on it sometimes... which I‚Äôm not sure is safe but sure is fun!‚Äù ‚Äì Wisdom ‚ÄúRepeatedly putting in my Amazon cart the Black Milanese Loop for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I was so close to buying it like three times. Now it‚Äôs out of stock. Even Apple says early November for shipping.‚Äù ‚Äì Scott ‚ÄúBeen playing with different LLMs using LM Studio. Integrated it into my Obsidian vault to help summarize and organize things into specific formats. It‚Äôs been extremely cool!‚Äù ‚Äì Cody I‚Äôve had back-to-back-to-back-to-back trips over the last two weeks, and I would just like to quickly shout out my new No. 1 travel hack: a wall charger that doubles as a big-ass portable battery. I have this Anker model, which is $55, charges a USB-C and a USB-A device simultaneously, and also charges itself so I can get 10,000mAh of power when there‚Äôs no outlet nearby. (There‚Äôs also a newer one with two USB-C ports and even faster charging but less battery capacity.) It‚Äôs huge and heavy, but this thing and a long cable are now the only charging gear I travel with, and they‚Äôre the only reasons my gadgets have survived trains and plane rides. Here at Installer, we love a sensible charging strategy, and this is as sensible as it gets.

Title: Brace for impact: Something big is coming

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/29/2024 4:02:28 AM PDT by george76 For the last couple of months, I‚Äôve been noting various articles in which very rich people are taking some remarkable steps: Buffett‚Äôs vice chairman dumps over half of his Berkshire shares.. Warren Buffett offloads Bank of America shares worth $982 million in latest sale.. Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire offloads Bank of America shares again; total sales near $7 billion.. Berkshire quietly dumps half its Apple shares amid unprecedented selling spree.. Blackrock reveals it‚Äôs quietly preparing for a $35 trillion Federal Reserve crisis with Bitcoin.. Jeff Bezos sells another $863.5 million of Amazon stock.. Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don‚Äôt know? Wealthy people (usually) aren‚Äôt fools. They watch the economic climate. It‚Äôs (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they‚Äôre watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it‚Äôs the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she‚Äôs outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and ‚Äúwould cause mass selling of almost everything ‚Äì stocks, bonds, homes, art ‚Äì I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.‚Äù But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, ‚ÄúOur country right now is in the most dangerous position it‚Äôs ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We‚Äôre very close to that, and we‚Äôre very close to a world war.‚Äù One person noted, ‚ÄúI believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‚Äònormal,‚Äô and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.‚Äù ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months‚Äô worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don‚Äôt know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore ‚Äì the point is, something is coming. Whatever this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù will be, it‚Äôs almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don‚Äôt ignore the ramifications. This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù may also impact your financial security (if it hasn‚Äôt already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it‚Äôs back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it‚Äôs back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it‚Äôs back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

Now, clearly wealthy people are always shifting around their financial portfolios. Still, these activities were unusual enough to warrant media attention. This begs the question, what do they know that we don‚Äôt know? Wealthy people (usually) aren‚Äôt fools. They watch the economic climate. It‚Äôs (usually) how they became wealthy. And the economic climate they‚Äôre watching apparently is worrying them. Now consider these headlines: JPMorgan CEO hints at looming crisis worse than recession.. Interest on U.S. debt surpasses $1 trillion for first time ever, exploding August budget deficit to record high.. An economy so strong it requires crisis-level fed action And, of course: Household debt hits record $17.8 trillion.. Conclusion from all these headlines: Something big is coming, and it‚Äôs the little people who will get hurt the most. ... Everyone is predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Kamala wins. The tax plans and economic policies she‚Äôs outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and ‚Äúwould cause mass selling of almost everything ‚Äì stocks, bonds, homes, art ‚Äì I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.‚Äù But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, ‚ÄúOur country right now is in the most dangerous position it‚Äôs ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We‚Äôre very close to that, and we‚Äôre very close to a world war.‚Äù One person noted, ‚ÄúI believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‚Äònormal,‚Äô and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.‚Äù ... Even a former FBI agent is suggesting stocking up on three to four months‚Äô worth of food, arming yourself, and clubbing up with neighbors. Again, what does he know that we don‚Äôt know? Something is coming, folks. Something much bigger than we as individuals can fight against. Whether that something is medical, economic, societal, political, or some combination therefore ‚Äì the point is, something is coming. Whatever this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù will be, it‚Äôs almost a sure bet it will nullify our constitutional rights of speech, religion, self-defense and other critical issues. Interpret that as you will, but don‚Äôt ignore the ramifications. This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù may also impact your financial security (if it hasn‚Äôt already) and even your food supply. Whatever steps you choose to take, take them now. Something big is coming, and we need to brace for impact. Food for thought as the election looms dead ahead.

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it‚Äôs back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it‚Äôs back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. 11 posted on 09/29/2024 4:15:56 AM PDT by fruser1 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SaveFerris Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget..

The tax plans and economic policies she‚Äôs outlined (including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and taxing unrealized capital gains) are making wealthy people nervous. One hedge fund billionaire said the proposed tax on unrealized capital gains on individuals making $100 million or more was particularly troubling and ‚Äúwould cause mass selling of almost everything ‚Äì stocks, bonds, homes, art ‚Äì I think it would result in a crash in the markets and an immediate, pretty quick recession.‚Äù But a Kamala presidency is predicted to impact the lower to middle-class the most. Increased regulations, taxes and inflation always hit the lowest sectors the hardest. But not as many people are predicting what kinds of bad stuff will happen if Trump is reelected. The Deep State pushback against his leadership is likely to be vicious and could include everything from deliberately crashing the economy to triggering terrorist sleeper cells. As Trump himself said, ‚ÄúOur country right now is in the most dangerous position it‚Äôs ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety. We‚Äôre very close to that, and we‚Äôre very close to a world war.‚Äù One person noted, ‚ÄúI believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office.

Also, Vance already raised the possibility that they do the Liz Truss coup, where the Bank of England and the Treasury and their @sshole cronies in the City created a financial crisis, then refused to act until she resigned. Definitely greatly concerns me as I‚Äôm totally-dependent upon SSI and I‚Äôve been in a precarious situation especially ever since COVID-19(84). Not just ‚Äúsomething‚Äù but many things. I think about a year ago, treasuries were in complete inversion, w/4 week bills fetching the highest rates. As they raised rates a bit that was starting to change where at least the 6 month bills were getting the highest rates. These rates were still higher than the 20/30 yr bonds so still inversion territory. Now, with the recent rate decrease, it‚Äôs back to 4 week t bills at the highest rate. So maybe the rate cut was actually premature and executed for political purposes and the rates will have to increase again (after the election of course). Since the markets went up significantly after the rate cut, and knowing they will, at least temporarily, drop after resumed increases, it makes sense to sell at the high point now and buy back when it tanks. Interest payments on just the federal government debt now exceed the entire Defense Department budget.. Unsustainable. The country is going bankrupt.. https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4264439/posts Let‚Äôs suppose they confiscate everything to pay it off. That would only be a temporary fix because the borrowing would continue in order to keep spending. True. Biden/Harris Let In 13K Murderers ,16K Rapists And 425K Convicted Criminals.. https://confoundedinterest.net/2024/09/28/south-of-the-border-biden-harris-let-in-13k-murderers-16k-rapists-and-425k-convicted-criminals/ evil bastards need to be taken down by good people when they reviel themselves as many have. We are to kind to do this Thanks for posting. Unprecedented, interesting times. Thanks believe they will INTENTIONALLY crash the economy right as [Trump] takes office. They will intentionally make it worse than 1929, so that he is so burdened and so distracted and in such a hole that even all of his brilliance will take four years just to dig us out and get us back to ‚Äònormal,‚Äô and then they will succeed because he will not be able to get anything else done during that time. All efforts will go towards rebuilding our economy from the rubble.‚Äù If these thoughts haven‚Äôt crossed your mind, you weren‚Äôt paying attention.

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year‚Äôs estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, ‚ÄúThe value of a business is the cash it‚Äôs going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.‚Äù Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don‚Äôt explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology‚Äôs superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500. Free Cash Flow Growth As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner‚Äôs cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa. Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Real Yields If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.‚Äù In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic. Cyclicals Versus Defensives So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn‚Äôt an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, ‚ÄúIn the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.‚Äù Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector. The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual. Though it doesn‚Äôt feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history. Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

This news caused the price of Ford‚Äôs stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

The market performance of the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the United States has been impressive over the last few weeks. Continuing their excellent streak, the crypto investment products closed the previous trading week with their best single-day performance in almost four months. The positive investor sentiment surrounding the spot ETFs seems to have also bubbled into the Bitcoin and the general crypto market, which has recovered well from an early price slump in September. On Friday, September 27, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market registered a total net inflow of $494.27 million, the highest value since the $886 million capital influx on June 4. This was another strong daily performance by the crypto-based products, which posted over $365 million in net inflows barely 24 hours before. According to data from SoSoValue, Ark Invest and 21Shares‚Äô ARKB led the day with an inflow of $203 million, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC followed in second place with a $124 million influx. In a seeming resurgence, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT came in third with a net inflow of over $110 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded a rare positive day, with $26.15 million flowing into the product. Unsurprisingly, this value represents the fund‚Äôs highest capital influx since mid-May, reflecting the level of redemption it has experienced since the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched. As a result of Friday‚Äôs performance, the total weekly net inflows for the BTC exchange-traded funds rose to a remarkable $1.11 billion. This billion-dollar showing makes it the third consecutive week in which the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs has recorded a cumulative weekly net inflow. The outstanding performance of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to have inspired its Ethereum counterpart, as the ETH funds posted their second positive trading week since launch. The Ethereum ETFs registered a cumulative net inflow of more than $84.51 million in the past week. On Friday, the total net inflow of spot Ethereum ETFs stood around $58.6 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that Fidelity‚Äôs FETH led with a capital influx of $42.5 million, with BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA in second with $11.46 million. iShares Ethereum ETF eclipses $1bil in assets‚Ä¶ Now in top 20% of all 3,700+ ETFs.

Title: Angry Amazon employees are ‚Äòrage applying‚Äô for new jobs after Andy Jassy‚Äôs RTO mandate: ‚ÄòI will not go back‚Äô

Laura was working from home when her husband forwarded her a link to the news: Amazon tells employees to return to office five days a week. It was the first time the working mom, who has been with Amazon for over four years, learned she would need to add another four hours to her weekly commute. ‚ÄúAt first, I didn‚Äôt quite believe it,‚Äù she tells Fortune. ‚ÄúAfter all, who expects to get career-altering news from a news article instead of your employer.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich, to be honest, is a pretty horrible way to find out about something that‚Äôs going to impact your life in a huge way. I really, really would have liked a personal communication from my manager, but that didn‚Äôt happen for a couple of days.‚Äù Laura says she was hired virtually during the pandemic with the understanding that there was no expectation to return to Amazon‚Äôs offices. That was, until 2023 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that he wanted workers to ‚Äúgo back to being in the office together the majority of the time‚Äù‚Äîat least, three days per week. ‚ÄúThe original RTO mandate was a tough pill to swallow, but the latest one is impossible,‚Äù she says. After the initial shock of the news blew over, Laura says a sense of calm and clarity washed over: ‚ÄúMy months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end.‚Äù Even if she could commit to commuting into the office full time, Laura says she would still quit over Amazon‚Äôs remote work bait and switch. ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.‚Äù Laura‚Äôs not alone: A handful of Amazon employees told Fortune that they‚Äôre so frustrated with the tech giant‚Äôs war on working from home that they‚Äôre officially on the job hunt. Two say they learned the news‚Äîand its implications‚Äîvia the media, rather than a manager. One says they‚Äôve already handed their notice in. Another says they‚Äôve had two interview offers within 48 hours of the RTO announcement. Amazon did not respond to Fortune‚Äôs request for comment. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly warned remote workers that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot going to work out‚Äù for them at the company. Despite this, it‚Äôs clear that a number of Amazon employees (and managers, for that matter) have been ignoring the guidelines up until now. Experts previously told Fortune that Amazon‚Äôs 5-day mandate is a ‚Äúnegotiation game‚Äù to get employees in the office for the 3 days it originally asked for. ‚ÄúI was not complying,‚Äù Ben, who lives three hours away from an Amazon office, comments on the previous hybrid policy. He briefly considered moving before thinking again: ‚ÄúI decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want.‚Äù Some managers were still assuring their new hires could work from home after the 3-day mandate came into effect. One employee told Fortune that he was hired remotely in May 2023‚Äîa month after the company announced its initial RTO policy. ‚ÄúI left a decent company I live near to go to Amazon since it was working from home,‚Äù Luca, a millennial analyst, complains. ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to go in the office, there is no office close to me.‚Äù He says that his manager has been covering for his absence from any office, but that will no longer work. ‚ÄúHe told me he would not be able to help, they‚Äôve made him go into an office too,‚Äù Luca says, adding that he couldn‚Äôt get a firm answer on whether he will be expected to head into the office despite being promised otherwise in the interview room. ‚ÄúI like my job at Amazon, but I need firm ground to stand on and they are not providing that.‚Äù Whether Jassy‚Äôs latest move is to make employees show their faces more frequently or not, workers have until Jan. 2, 2025 (the date he‚Äôs given them to relocate if needed) to call his bluff‚Äîor quit. Most of the people Fortune spoke to think that Amazon is secretly hoping for the latter anyway. While Jassy positioned Amazon‚Äôs changes‚Äîwhich also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking‚Äîas a better way to work, disgruntled employees are adamant that it‚Äôs a thinly veiled headcount reduction. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,‚Äù Gen X program manager Jared says. Although he‚Äôs only been working at Amazon for six months, he‚Äôs already changed his LinkedIn status to #opentowork, reached out to former colleagues, and updated his resume in the hopes of finding a more flexible job before Jan. 2. ‚ÄúThe new policy is less flexible than pre-COVID and does not respect the needs of employees to take care of their health, their family, or work-life balance,‚Äù Jared scoffs. ‚ÄúI will not go back.‚Äù While he was complying with the three-day policy, he refused to return to working in a cubicle five days a week when Amazon‚Äôs competitors are still offering some working from home‚Äîand he thinks many others will do the same. ‚ÄúAs a top performer with prior MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) experience in this tight market, I believe it will be fairly easy to find a new role that is at least hybrid,‚Äù Jared adds. ‚ÄúOne of my co-workers put in his notice on Monday. I expect others to follow.‚Äù He‚Äôs not wrong. Rumors of a stricter RTO were enough ammunition to inspire Ben to quit‚Äîhe took ‚Äúvoluntary termination‚Äù two months ago and has now started his own firm. Likewise, Lisa, a marketing leader in Europe, has called time on her four years at Amazon. After hearing about Jassy‚Äôs announcement via the news, the 40-something says she immediately started reaching out to recruiters. ‚ÄúThis new mandate goes against so many of the leadership principles that we supposedly hold so dear,‚Äù she says, adding that she has been a ‚Äútop-rated employee year on year‚Äù thanks to working from home. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve constantly delivered for this business and their reward is to order me back into the office, where I will sit at my desk either writing docs or sitting on calls,‚Äù Lisa adds. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to work for a business that clearly has so little respect for me.‚Äù Every job that Lisa has applied for offers hybrid work, and she‚Äôs confident she‚Äôll find a more flexible employer before the New Year. Within 48 hours of Amazon‚Äôs new policy going public, she had already secured two job interviews. ‚ÄúI will always work hard, but now I want to work for a company that works hard for me too.‚Äù Interviewee names have been changed for anonymity. ¬© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft downgraded, Micron rally ‚Äòwill sustain‚Äô

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! D.A. Davidson analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from a Buy to a Neutral rating on Monday, maintaining their $475 price target. The firm pointed to increasing competition in AI as the reason for the revision, noting that rivals have largely caught up to Microsoft‚Äôs AI capabilities. This, they argue, "reduces the justification for the current premium valuation." Microsoft‚Äôs stock has soared by 92% since January 2023, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which gained 49% over the same period. But now, D.A. Davidson analysts believe that Microsoft's lead in cloud and AI is narrowing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP) have demonstrated similar growth rates, which has closed the gap in cloud business expansion. ‚ÄúOur new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in terms of deploying their own silicon into their data centers, which gives them a significant advantage over Azure going forward,‚Äù they said in a note. Microsoft‚Äôs Maia chips are still behind Amazon and Google by several years, with their current use limited to Azure OpenAI Services workloads. This, according to D.A. Davidson, places Microsoft in a challenging position in the competitive data center landscape. Another concern raised by the analysts is Microsoft‚Äôs reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for data center operations, which could lead to a shift of value from Microsoft shareholders to Nvidia‚Äôs. Microsoft‚Äôs operating margins are under pressure due to rising data center capital expenditures, which have jumped from 12% to 21% of revenue. ‚ÄúThis is a higher rate of increase compared to Amazon and Google, a result of Microsoft‚Äôs greater reliance on NVIDIA,‚Äù analysts continued. ‚ÄúEvery year Microsoft over-invests at these rates, it will diminish margins by at least 1pp in a cumulative manner. Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment in order to offset the margin drag.‚Äù Also, the firm expressed concerns about the sustainability of Azure‚Äôs revenue growth, hinting that it could be inflated by contributions from OpenAI's self-funded revenue. This week, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) kicked off its developer-focused event, Meta Connect, unveiling its latest hardware and software innovations. One of the key highlights was the launch of the Quest 3S, the newest virtual reality (VR) headset from Meta's Reality Labs division, offered at a more affordable price than its predecessor. Also, Meta introduced a new prototype of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses and revealed updates to its Meta AI chatbot. The chatbot now includes a voice interaction feature, allowing users to engage through both spoken and written commands. Here‚Äôs what analysts said after the event: Citi: ‚ÄúMeta‚Äôs new AI products, features, and devices announced at Connect ‚Äò24 make us incrementally confident that its product innovation can deliver increased engagement and monetization as the ROI from its AI investments continues to expand.‚Äù Bank of America: ‚ÄúWe think AI Glasses have much broader market potential than VR Googles. While Metaverse spend still seems hard to justify, with glasses long-term investors may have some renewed optimism on Meta‚Äôs opportunity to be at the forefront of the next generation of personal computing devices. ‚ÄúMore importantly, the company appears to be successfully innovating around new AI capabilities, driving usage growth which can offset terminal value concerns, and we see Meta as the top AI pick in consumer Internet.‚Äù JMP Securities analysts said earlier this week that Google's enterprise AI adoption is accelerating, driven by increased use of its Gemini platform. "We are seeing signs that enterprise adoption of AI is inflecting." At Google's "Gemini at Work" event, the tech giant highlighted a 35x surge in Gemini platform usage, with 75% of daily users reporting improvements in work quality due to AI. JMP Securities views this as a clear signal of a turning point in enterprise AI adoption. The firm credits Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for removing barriers to AI adoption by achieving compliance with key standards like SOC 1, 2, 3, and HIPAA, and forging integration partnerships with major companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). These efforts have resulted in 85 new enterprise use cases over the past six months, driving meaningful cost savings and revenue growth opportunities for businesses. JMP Securities also stressed the growing importance of AI as corporations focus on technological transformation. Google‚Äôs integration of AI solutions with both first- and third-party data is improving accuracy and functionality, further boosting enterprise AI usage. The firm noted that generative AI usage by enterprises has surged 15x, while adoption of AI agents has grown by 6x. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) saw its shares jump nearly 15% on Thursday after delivering an optimistic first-quarter revenue outlook, driven by strong demand and pricing for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial to the rapidly expanding generative AI sector. The chipmaker, a key supplier to Nvidia, added approximately $15 billion to its market capitalization as its stock surged around 27% over the past three weeks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not a good day to be short memory and semi-cap equipment stocks,‚Äù a Mizuho analyst remarked after the report‚Äôs release and Micron‚Äôs stock jump. ‚ÄúFor the memory and semi cap equipment bears, I would advise against going down in a ball of flames and cover shorts and consider getting long some key semi winners even if you dislike MU and not willing to chase this 15%+ rip at the open,‚Äù the analyst added. ‚ÄúPersonally, I think the MU rally will sustain and pull in many of these long/short haters who will flip from short to long at least for the near term.‚Äù Micron is shifting its focus away from lower-margin segments like PCs and smartphones to higher-margin, high-value products, such as HBM chips for servers and data centers. Mizuho highlighted that Micron management is confident their technology leads in both power and performance, outperforming competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung (KS:005930). Following Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) latest earnings report published this week, Piper Sandler analysts upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight, raising the price target to $395 from $329. Despite Accenture's overall FY25 guidance meeting expectations, analysts are optimistic about several underlying metrics. The company's first-quarter forecast exceeded consensus, with strong bookings of $20.2 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x. moreover, Accenture‚Äôs workforce expanded significantly, adding 24,000 employees, marking a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter increase. ‚ÄúThe setup for FY25 seems attractive as full-year guidance assumes no improvement beyond 1Q,‚Äù analysts wrote. One of the key growth drivers was in Generative AI (GenAI), where bookings and revenues grew approximately tenfold. In FY24, GenAI bookings hit $3 billion, with revenues of $900 million, up from $300 million and $100 million, respectively. ‚ÄúImportantly, the company is starting to see some scaled GenAI projects; and an increase in the number of data projects and security-related work ($9B in revenues, +23% growth),‚Äù Piper Sandler‚Äôs team noted. ‚ÄúOverall, we believe owning ACN is attractive, given improving top-line metrics, a conservative guide, and that it is a key beneficiary of GenAI-related work.‚Äù

Check out How Sectors Perform After Rate Cuts to see where else gains are made. NO to "Unions" -- they're COMMUNIST. I‚Äôm fortunate to be a decent union position. I also have to be to do my job. Most of the other office workers in different jobs organized 5-6 years ago because the company was putting screws to everyone and not paying decent wages. If a company is fair and pays competitive wages, generally workers aren‚Äôt interested in unions. Don‚Äôt care as long as they‚Äôre not public unions where the taxpayers are NOT represented in the collective bargaining. And when these soft-trade private companies unionize, there will be plenty of hurt. Joining a labor union is like volunteering to take military orders from Kamala Harris or from Hillary Clinton. Outside of government, fewer and fewer employees choose to join a union. You are free to join one if you wish. it all depends on the type of union. and I suppose the country it is in. I have heard ok things about unions in germany. I have seen good and bad unions in the united states, yes mostly bad and corrupt. I suspect the founding fathers would agree that government unions need refreshing at some point Unions systematically destroy industries, and so are constantly looking for new profitable fields to exploit. Money is one thing. Forced full time return to office is another. Money will make workers put up with a lot of crap, but everyone has their breaking point.

Title: ‚ÄòFellas who were taking the piss are now looking for tips‚Äô: at home in the garden with Ireland and Munster rugby star Peter O‚ÄôMahony

Time Published: 2024-09-29T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Peter O‚ÄôMahony isn‚Äôt sinking his studs into the world‚Äôs greatest rugby pitches, he‚Äôs tending to the pristine grass on his own lawn. His love of gardening was brought to international attention during the World Cup when his mother, Caroline, held up a sign declaring she was watering his lawn while he was gone. So the question on everyone‚Äôs lips is: was it true? Did she water his lawn? ‚ÄúShe did not,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúShe absolutely did nothing in my garden. I don‚Äôt know how she ended up with that sign, to be honest with you. I must get her doing some watering now after that.‚Äù The Munster and Ireland flanker‚Äôs interest in gardening is not a recent fad. As a child, he loved to help the gardener when he visited his grandmother Maura Conroy in Cork‚Äôs Richmond Hill. ‚ÄúThey were my earliest memories of spending time in the garden,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúSimple stuff, but I remember it being very enjoyable.‚Äù His grandmother died last year, but he has something to remember her by in his garden ‚Äì a Japanese maple tree. ‚ÄúI moved it from her garden a few years ago. It has taken a while to settle in, but this is the first year it has really bloomed nicely.‚Äù The garden was one of the features that drew him and his wife Jessica to their home in Blackrock, Co Cork, 10 years ago. ‚ÄúWe used to walk by the house a lot and say if it ever came up for sale we‚Äôd love to buy it, and all of a sudden it did.‚Äù Since then, they have been gradually redeveloping the house and garden. ‚ÄúIt was a beautiful old cottage garden, a bit wilder than now, but lots of lovely stuff,‚Äù he recalls. When they moved in, he started with the lawn, naturally. ‚ÄúSome people find cutting grass a chore. I don‚Äôt. I enjoy it,‚Äù he says. As a child he mowed lawns for neighbours, including former Ireland and Munster rugby player Frankie Sheahan. ‚ÄúHe used to give me a few bits of gear instead of money. I was delighted with the gear and chatting with Frankie at the time was great fun.‚Äù Taking on a mature garden of this size ‚Äì about 200sq m (2,150sq ft) ‚Äì was a daunting task, and on reflection he feels he rushed into the work. He would advise anyone in a similar situation to wait a season or two and watch how the garden grows. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm quite impatient to be honest, so that was never going to happen.‚Äù Many people are now asking him for advice since he began posting about the garden on Instagram (@peteomahony), where he has amassed more than 300,000 followers. A video of him trimming the sides of the lawn on TikTok (@peteromahony6) has been viewed 5.3 million times. His Annabelle hydrangeas with their giant mophead flowers have garnered much envy. ‚ÄúThey have taken over, to be honest with you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise how big they were going to get, but it looks well in summer, that kind of block planting.‚Äù Weeded, edged, trimmed & seeded some patches. #lawncare But not everything succeeded. ‚ÄúI love wisteria, but I struggle with it. I tried it a couple of times in pots, but I think that‚Äôs a bad idea because it‚Äôs a hungry, vigorous plant that needs to be in the ground, so that failed a couple times,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve let a couple things die, watering wise, unfortunately, being away.‚Äù Some of his plans for the garden have been held back by his heavy training schedule and travel demands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to grow more food, but I don‚Äôt have the time at the moment,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou need to be on top of stuff all the time, but I need to be able to drop things and go for a week or two at a time. And during the summer things get crazy when you are growing food. I‚Äôll definitely get stuck into it more when I finish playing.‚Äù But he still finds time to grow potatoes, beetroot and salad leaves. ‚ÄúWe have some raspberries and other berries that come back every year. They need to be cut in spring and [we] try to get them picked before the birds get them. And we have a line of apple and pear trees, male and female, that pollinate themselves. Trees are foolproof once you give them the bit of pruning that they need.‚Äù He says the garden is starting to mature nicely now. ‚ÄúI was lucky to be able to put some mature shrubbery and plants in there that gave it some structure quite quickly.‚Äù It made a perfect backdrop when he and Jessica decided to get married in the garden during the Covid pandemic. ‚ÄúIt was lovely. We had our immediate family in the garden and getting it ready gave me something to focus on.‚Äù While he‚Äôs happy to share his knowledge with other gardeners, he is also keen to learn from the experts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always watched Gardeners‚Äô World and I enjoy that. I like Adam Frost and Monty Don obviously is very enjoyable to watch,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI used to spend a lot of time in west Cork with my uncle who worked as a greenkeeper and grew a lot of his own stuff. He definitely taught me a lot.‚Äù And judging by the videos he posts on Instagram, his three children are now learning from him. Their youngest child, Ralph, seems to have inherited his father‚Äôs love of lawncare and is often seen pushing a toy lawn mower. ‚ÄúWe have lots of songbirds and the kids have their books on recognising the different types of birds. Theo is definitely into the wildlife side of things. He‚Äôs very interested in bugs and bees and birds and fishing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIndie then is very much into the neat and tidy stuff, keeping things where they should be. And Ralph just runs around trying to break everything up. If they want to get stuck into it, they‚Äôre more than capable of digging holes and damaging things.‚Äù Speaking of digging holes, his Ireland team-mate Bundee Aki had been threatening to damage his prized lawn for a long time. So when O‚ÄôMahony hosted a party after the Six Nations victory and Bundee grabbed a spade, he had good reason to worry. ‚ÄúBundee put a few divot holes in it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI do two or three days on the lawn every spring and autumn to level it and reseed it, so I knew that was coming up and I wasn‚Äôt too bothered. But I told him if he went near the flowers or the shrubs there would have been serious trouble.‚Äù When he first started posting about his garden on social media, a few team-mates seized the opportunity for some slagging. ‚ÄúBut now a lot of the fellas who were taking the piss a bit are all of a sudden looking for tips on what to put where or should I put this in that pot, that sort of thing. There‚Äôs a lot of advice being requested.‚Äù With all eyes on his retirement plans now that he‚Äôs in his last season with Munster, will gardening play a role in that post-rugby future? ‚ÄúI certainly have plans,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about a career, but I certainly have an interest in working on that side of things.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been lucky that I‚Äôve done something that I have a huge passion for, and I have been paid well to do it so I don‚Äôt want to get stuck into something that I‚Äôm not very passionate about. I‚Äôm lucky that I am passionate about this. I‚Äôll definitely do something in that space, but you‚Äôll have to wait and see.‚Äù Watch out, Monty Don. There‚Äôs a new gardener in town. ¬© 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Hollywood's big boom has gone bust
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6er83ene6o
Time Published: 2024-09-28T23:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Fortin was at the heart of Hollywood‚Äôs golden age of streaming. The actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Now he‚Äôs on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California. ‚ÄúWe were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTwo years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks." ‚ÄúNow I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.‚Äù For over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood‚Äôs writers went on strike. The strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled. Projects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance. Unemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they‚Äôre not eligible or they‚Äôve exhausted those benefits after months of not working. As a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions. That means fewer new movies and binge-worthy shows for us. But experts say the streaming boom wasn‚Äôt sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don‚Äôt pay for cable TV funded by commercials. ‚ÄúThe air has come out of the content bubble,‚Äù says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. ‚ÄúCrisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.‚Äù Part of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers. ‚ÄúIt caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,‚Äù Mr Belloni says. ‚ÄúNetflix crashed ‚Äì all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered ‚Äì but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.‚Äù And along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood. ‚ÄúThe entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,‚Äù Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a ‚Äúcornerstone‚Äù of the city‚Äôs economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Recent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (¬£86bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said. The writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon. ‚ÄúWhat makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,‚Äù he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections. Hollywood ‚Äúalways thinks it‚Äôs in crisis,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.‚Äù Mr Fortin‚Äôs drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes. Now he‚Äôs flown the drones just 22 days in the year since the strikes ended. And as an actor - he often plays tough guys - he has worked just 10 days. He used to work as a background actor to get by, but the pay barely covers the gas money to get to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. ‚ÄúIt was a great wave, and it crashed,‚Äù Mr Fortin said after a day flying his drones on the AppleTV+ show Platonic - his first gig with drones since April. ‚ÄúThings are coming in little by little,‚Äù he says in his van before driving back to Las Vegas for a court hearing to fight his eviction order. ‚ÄúHollywood gave me everything,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.‚Äù US President Joe Biden says the US "actively" supported Israel's defence at his direction. New alleged victims are to sue to the hip-hop mogul, who denies all allegations of wrongdoing. Israel warns of consequences for the attack, which Iran says was retaliation for attacks on its allies. Catastrophic flooding decimated towns, destroyed roads and cut off power in the US's south-east. Helene ravages six southeastern US states, leaving at least 135 dead and entire communities destroyed.

Title: Super Micro: Assessing the Potential Risk and Reward

Time Published: 2024-09-28T20:43:18Z

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got off to an incredible start this year as shares more than quadrupled from January to mid-March. This surge made Super Micro eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, with the technology hardware stock (with links to AI) being added to the index on March 18, 2024. In hindsight, that would have been a great time to take profits or Short the stock, as shares are down by more than 50% since then. One of the major developments has been the report by Hindenburg Research, which contained worrying allegations about the company‚Äôs financial reporting. In assessing those allegations along with Super Micro‚Äôs fundamentals I hold a neutral rating on the stock. The Hindenburg report is actually the main reason I am neutral instead of bullish on SMCI stock, and I believe it has caused hesitancy among many AI stock analysts and investors. The accusations are pretty straightforward. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro engaged in accounting manipulation which included ‚Äúsibling self-dealing and evading sanctions‚Äù. Anyone who thinks this sounds far fetched may wish to remember that the SEC charged Super Micro with widespread accounting violations in August 2020. Hindenburg‚Äôs report also argued that most of the people involved with that accounting malpractice are back on Super Micro‚Äôs team. Hindenburg‚Äôs team interviewed several Super Micro salespeople and employees when compiling their report. It doesn‚Äôt help that Super Micro delayed its 10-K filing to assess internal controls shortly after Hindenburg went public with its concerns. While this might simply be a coincidence, the timing is worrisome. Looking back several years, Super Micro had failed to file financial statements in 2018 and was briefly delisted from the Nasdaq as a result. Near the beginning of this month, Super Micro publicly issued a denial of the accusations, with CEO Charles Liang hitting back, stating that Hindenburg‚Äôs report contained, ‚Äúmisleading presentations of information‚Äù. Super Micro hasn‚Äôt provided any additional statements since then. Super Micro‚Äôs status as part of the fast moving world of AI is one of the few reasons that I am neutral instead of bearish SMCI stock. The exciting prospects for the company‚Äôs business and the serious nature of the Hindenburg allegations basically offset each other. It‚Äôs hard to know what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs false here, but most people concede that the AI industry as a whole offers compelling growth prospects. Nvidia (NVDA) has been posting triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters. Other tech giants have incorporated artificial intelligence into their core businesses and delivered impressive results for their shareholders. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its cloud revenue rise by 28.8% year-over-year as many businesses rushed to create their own AI tools. The artificial intelligence industry is also projected to maintain a 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. The AI industry should continue to grow, and that should lift Super Micro. The company should benefit from Nvidia‚Äôs growth, which is why the company posted exceptional revenue and net income growth during Nvidia‚Äôs ascent. That‚Äôs what we saw for several quarters. We just don‚Äôt know how accurate all the numbers were, if the allegations targeting the firm have merit. While it‚Äôs impossible to overlook Hindenburg‚Äôs allegations against Super Micro, it‚Äôs still worthwhile assessing the company‚Äôs previous quarterly results. Shares were dropping even before Hindenburg released its report. While in March 2024 I argued that SMCI stock faced risks, I felt that shares presented a tremendous buying opportunity in late-summer, until Hindenburg muddied that optimism. For its last reported quarter, Super Micro posted net sales of $5.31 billion, representing a 143% year-over-year jump. Meanwhile, net income rose by 82% year-over-year, reaching $353 million. At the time of the release, my primary concern was Super Micro‚Äôs declining net profit margin. Super Micro currently trades at a 20x trailing P/E ratio, seemingly enough to compensate for any further erosion in profit margins. SMCI stock has a ridiculously low 13.6x forward P/E ratio, but with the recent speedbumps (the Hindenburg report and DOJ investigation) investors seems reluctant to bid the valuation multiple any higher right now. We don‚Äôt yet have tangible proof that Super Micro has engaged in any wrongdoing, as alleged by Hindenburg. Their report, however, has certainly cast a black eye on the stock. I expect that Super Micro would have significantly outperformed its fiscal 2023 results even excluding any misdealings. The Super Micro controversy added a new chapter on September 26, as news crossed the wires that the U.S. Department of Justice is now probing the company. SMCI stock tumbled an additional 12% on this news, and shares were recently trading at less than one-third of their all time high in March. There‚Äôs a high risk/reward on the shares at this point, but the elevated risks have relegated me to the sidelines with a neutral rating. Super Micro shares bounced back by more than 4% on Friday, September 27, suggesting that many investors believe that the long-term potential for the business is worth the heightened uncertainty. Although the ratings for this stock could change quickly, Super Micro currently has 2 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating from the 13 analysts that cover the stock. The average price target for SMCI is $613.92, which implies potential upside of nearly 50%. Again though, it‚Äôs quite possible that several research brokerages have placed their SMCI ratings under review. SMCI stock does have a few low price targets including $454, $375 and $325 from CFRA, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Susquehanna respectively. All of these price targets were established before the DOJ probe was announced, so even they could drop lower. There‚Äôs an old adage that suggests, ‚ÄúYou either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain‚Äù. That quote seems apropos for this company. Super Micro earned many investors hefty profits during its rise above a stock price of $1,000 per share. Those who entered the story late, including after SMCI stock was added to the S&P 500, have not fared well. Many investors are sitting on significant losses right now. Depending on what those investors do, it‚Äôs hard to tell how much more downside Super Micro shares may have until more clarity on the ordeals is available. If the company‚Äôs recent financials are accurate, SMCI shares look quite attractive here. Shares can surge quickly if the Hindenburg report loses relevance, although that outcome difficult to predict. I‚Äôm a big fan of Super Micro‚Äôs industry and business potential related to AI, which prevents me from being downright bearish. I have a neutral stance here. Meanwhile, I don‚Äôt expect shares of SMCI to rebound above $460 (the approximate price prior to news of the DOJ probe) without any resolution to the two main threats to shareholder value.

September 28, 2024 15:40 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 ‚Äì July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. ‚ÄúThis was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,‚Äù Green declared, ‚Äúand we cannot let it happen again.‚Äù Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike‚Äôs senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress‚Äô interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called ‚Äúthe blue screen of death.‚Äù Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike‚Äôs customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Title: Bitcoin ‚Äì THIS key signal suggests BTC‚Äôs next ATH will be in November

Bitcoin may be ready to climb to new levels over the next few months. Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, driving momentum towards a much-anticipated bull market. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66k, sparking excitement for potential new all-time highs (ATHs) in the final quarter of the year. Here, it‚Äôs worth looking at historical data though. Particularly the 2-week Ichimoku Cloud indicator since it has accurately predicted Bitcoin‚Äôs ATHs in past cycles. With the current cycle progressing ahead of schedule, there‚Äôs probably no need to wait for the moving averages to cross. The leading spans show us when it will happen, indicating that a new high may be formed in November. Source: CryptoCon/X Many are now wondering if November will be the month Bitcoin hits new heights. Especially with institutions and traders keeping a close eye on this timeline. One key factor supporting this possibility is the repetition of the 2019 pattern. The Gaussian Channel on the 3-day BTC chart has turned red, which has historically occurred only twice ‚Äì During the Covid crash and during Phase 2 of Bitcoin‚Äôs previous bull run. When this pattern last emerged during Covid 19, it led to a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin to new ATHs. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could be poised for another major upwards move, and potentially new highs in November. Source: X However, market dynamics will ultimately determine the outcome, and it remains to be seen if this pattern will indeed lead to higher prices. Another factor that could propel Bitcoin higher is the impact of heavily borrowed USDT. Traders have been borrowing large amounts of USDT to buy Bitcoin. However, instead of pushing the price up, it initially led to a decline, causing over-leveraged traders to face losses. This type of market behavior often precedes a significant rally. Especially as retail traders are shaken out through liquidations. If the current trend continues, this will create a perfect setup for Bitcoin to surge to new highs, potentially in November. Source: Hyblock Capital Moreover, BlackRock‚Äôs continued accumulation of Bitcoin lends further confidence to the bullish outlook. Earlier this week, BlackRock (IBIT) purchased 4,460 BTC, worth $289 million, increasing its total holdings to over 362,000 BTC. This was followed by another purchase of 1,434 BTC worth $94.3 million. Recently, they added another 5,894 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 363,626 BTC, valued at $23.68 billion. BlackRock‚Äôs significant and ongoing investment in Bitcoin means that they foresee substantial price appreciation, possibly as soon as November. Source: Lookonchain/X With historical patterns, market dynamics, and institutional support all aligning, Bitcoin‚Äôs price could hit new highs in the near future. The potential for a bullish run remains strong, and traders and investors will be closely monitoring developments as November approaches. If these factors come together, Bitcoin may not only hit new ATHs but also establish itself firmly in higher price ranges for the rest of the year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto On Verge Of Losing Iconic Top Bitcoin Holder Crown To U.S. BTC ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/satoshi-nakamoto-on-verge-of-losing-iconic-top-bitcoin-holder-crown-to-u-s-btc-etfs/

After less than a year of trading on Wall Street, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are well on pace to surpass the estimated BTC stack of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of the flagship cryptocurrency. Should this accumulation trend continue, the Bitcoin ETFs may collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi by as early as this Christmas. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed that the nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds now trading on American stock exchanges have amassed an astounding $17.8 billion in inflows in 2024 ‚Äî representing a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC. That is just about 84,000 BTC away from the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. The ETFs are closing in on Nakamoto‚Äôs estimated 1.1 million BTC stash, which the world‚Äôs most elusive man mined in the infancy of Bitcoin and hasn‚Äôt touched after disappearing more than 13 years ago. And the spot Bitcoin ETFs now aren‚Äôt far behind. The January launch of the Bitcoin ETFs was one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Billions of dollars have hit the funds as investors previously scared off from crypto investing finally got a safe and regulated way to buy Bitcoin. The top three ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have accumulated 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. In total, all the BTC ETFs need to load up on roughly 183,953 BTC to surpass Satoshi‚Äôs believed tally. If these funds continue increasing their Bitcoin reserves at the same rate, they could overtake Satoshi‚Äôs stockpile and kick him off the top. US bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They‚Äôre now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock.. pic.twitter.com/kTxlIzjJy6 Tolou Capital Management founder Spencer Hakimian shared Balchunas‚Äôs sentiment, predicting that ‚ÄúETFs are going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas‚Äù, to which the Bloomberg pundit agreed, adding that BlackRock‚Äôs ETF alone will at some point top the list of Bitcoin holders. Meanwhile, a top crypto market analyst has recently posited that the fast-rising concentration of Bitcoin by spot ETFs is the main reason the United States is ‚Äúregaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings,‚Äù compared to the rest of the world.

Title: How to Create AI Images: A Complete Guide With Expert Advice
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-create-ai-images-a-complete-guide-with-expert-advice/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T16:30:00Z

Here's what to know about creating AI-generated imagery, including the best programs, practical tips and legal considerations. AI image generators open up a world of creative possibilities. A picture is worth a thousand words. But with generative AI, you'll need to start with words to get that image. Generative artificial intelligence tech has exploded in the past few years, leading to a lot of creative services that can generate entire images and video clips. That's the "generative" aspect of gen AI -- it can produce content seemingly from just a simple text prompt. Of course, the actual process is more complicated. AI image generators rely on a database of existing content (text, images, videos, etc.), and/or scrape the open web for information to create new images to fulfill your request. They allow anyone with an account and a prompt to create almost any kind of image (usually within reason). There are a lot of AI image services available, but not all will deliver quality results or adequately protect your data. They also vary in price and features offered. While AI generators can be exciting to explore, getting started can quickly feel overwhelming. That's where this guide comes in handy. I've tested and reviewed multiple AI image generators for CNET and covered how the new tech affects digital creators. These services are certainly interesting and serve their purposes, but there‚Äôs a learning curve to them. While they're not good enough to replace human creators, they offer a range of creative possibilities. Here's how you can create custom AI images. I've had hands-on experience with many AI image generators and creative programs. The best program for you is going to depend on your project, budget and experience level. You can check out our full reviews and rankings, but these are my three program recommendations. CNET's Editor's Choice is Dall-E 3 by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Dall-E boasts impressive prompt adherence, handling more complex prompts with ease. Its conversational flow -- meaning you can follow up easily by typing in the chat window -- allows for easy post-generation editing. Dall-E is also one of the more creative programs we've tested. You'll need a ChatGPT Plus account to access the program -- $20 per month -- and note that OpenAI may use your content for model training. But you can submit a request for it to stop training on your data. If you're looking for a free program, I recommend Leonardo AI. Canva recently acquired it, but you can still use it on its website. Leonardo offers a robust free plan, with more editing tools behind its paywall, and several artistic styles to choose from. It also provides a unique prompt improvement tool, which can take a simple idea and rewrite it, filling in details that make for beautiful end results. If you're really balling on a budget and have no creative experience, check out Canva's Magic Media generator. It's extremely intuitive and easy to navigate, which is great for beginners and non-creatives. Canva offers you 50 free credits for image generation (those are lifetime credits -- you'll have to upgrade for more credits on the paid Pro plan after using up your free tier allowance) and automatically opts you out of training its AI on your content. Once you've picked your program, create an account and make your way to the prompt window. Your best chance of success starts with a well-written prompt. Every prompt should include the basics of the characters, the setting, other elements and the image's dimensions. But to really hone in on the image you want, add descriptions of the artistic style you're looking to mimic, the aesthetic, vibe and specific colors. Leonardo might not understand a prompt that asks for "cottage core coastal grandma," but it does understand "rustic feel with blues and warm light." AI image generators rightfully have limitations around what you can generate. This is to prevent people from abusing these services to create illegal content and potentially dangerous or offensive content. For example, Dall-E 3 will decline to generate images that request public figures by name, like President Biden or Taylor Swift. Be sure to check out your service's safety policies before generating. Prompt engineering -- the process of writing the right prompt to get your desired results -- is something you get better at with practice. It also varies between each image generator. Canva, for example, tends to do better with simple prompts, whereas Dall-E encourages longer, more detailed prompts. Playing around with your program is the best way to get to know it. You can also check out my complete guide to image prompt engineering for more tips and tricks. Once you've got your best prompt, go ahead and generate! Even with the best generator, you're likely need to edit your images after they're created. Depending on the service you use, you may have access to editing tools or the ability to request changes. Be wary of over-editing your images. I've found that services can only handle so many changes before the image becomes too wonky, and ultimately unusable. Take this image I made in Midjourney as a cautionary tale of what happens when you over-edit. Sometimes it's best to start anew. Post-generation editing tools are one area where AI services tend to shine or fall flat. If your service doesn't offer them (or they don't work very well), try editing your prompt rather than the picture. In my experience, that's going to give you better odds of success rather than trying to incrementally edit existing images. It's extremely important to label your images as AI-created content. As AI image services improve, it's essential that all creators clearly identify the origins of an image, especially to distinguish it from human-created art and photography. In the bottom left corner, Meta AI watermarks all its AI-generated images. Some services automatically add a watermark or other marking indicating it's AI-generated, but too many don't, like Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Midjourney, Canva and Leonardo. If you're sharing your image online, make sure to include the AI service you used in the caption, credit and/or alt text. You can also add a disclaimer to your posts if you're sharing on social media -- Meta might flag them as containing AI content on Instagram and Facebook, but adding a line to your caption will help ensure there isn't any confusion. As of publication, the use of AI image generators is legal. But there are important legal and ethical considerations you should be aware of when creating AI images. Here are a couple of quick frequently asked questions. AI image services like Midjourney and Dall-E rely on existing content to help them create pictures. This content, either in a database or on the open web, is typically created by humans. As such, some creators and artists have major concerns about how these programs are designed and trained. That's led to uproar in the industry and a couple of notable lawsuits, including an ongoing case against Stable Diffusion, an AI model used by popular generators. If you're worried about using a service that might potentially mistreat creators, pick one that clearly discloses how it trains its model. Some AI services rely on public databases, like Adobe Stock and Getty Images, where creators sign agreements with the companies to enter their work into those collections for specific uses. Adobe Firefly, for example, says it only uses content from its Adobe Stock public databases and images whose copyrights have expired. It also won't train on your content. As these AI services evolve, the legalities and ethics around them are poised to change as well. If you're going to be a regular AI art creator, make sure you stay up to date with the latest requirements, which we'll cover in our AI Atlas guide.

On Friday, BMO Capital adjusted its outlook on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), raising the stock's price target from $950.00 to $980.00. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating for the retailer. The revision follows Costco's reported earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, which showed strong performance indicators, including better-than-expected gross margin percentages and comparable sales. The company's recent earnings report highlighted a robust increase in global customer traffic, up by 6%, with a significant 11-12% rise on a two-year stack basis. The strong performance metrics have led to an above-average growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year 2024. Despite this growth, BMO Capital projects a more conservative EPS growth rate in the coming years, taking into account Costco's pattern of reinvesting market funds incrementally (MFI) increases. Costco's momentum in E-commerce was also a notable point in the analysis by BMO Capital. The retailer's continued expansion in the digital space is seen as a positive driver of its business model. While acknowledging that the company's valuation has reached new heights, the firm still finds Costco's stock attractive, citing the slightly higher EPS revisions as a basis for the increased price target. The analyst from BMO Capital highlighted the company's solid underlying financials in the fourth fiscal quarter, which surpassed the firm's forecasts. The statement underscored the strength in gross margins and comparable sales, which contributed to the positive outlook. "We continue to be encouraged by COST's momentum in Ecommerce growth and while valuation has expanded to new highs, COST remains attractive in our view," said the analyst from BMO Capital. With the new price target set at $980, BMO Capital's stance reflects confidence in Costco's ongoing growth trajectory and its ability to maintain a strong position in the market. The firm's analysis suggests a belief in the retailer's strategic investments and its potential for sustained financial success. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale reported mixed results in its fourth-quarter earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $5.29 surpassing both Goldman Sachs and consensus estimates, but falling slightly short on its revenue target of $79.70 billion. Despite the slight miss, same-store sales witnessed a 6.9% increase, exceeding the anticipated 6.4%. In response to potential disruptions due to a possible strike at U.S. ports, Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, outlined extensive contingency plans. The company's recent performance has led to varied reactions from analyst firms. Baird maintains an Outperform rating on Costco with a price target of $975, highlighting the company's strong comparable sales momentum and healthy membership key performance indicators. However, Roth/MKM, DA Davidson, and Citi have maintained a Neutral stance, while Truist Securities, Redburn-Atlantic have expressed valuation concerns, downgrading or maintaining neutral stances on the company's shares. Goldman Sachs remains optimistic, maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target to $995. These are recent developments for Costco Wholesale. As BMO Capital raises its price target for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), it's important to note some key financial metrics and insights that underscore the retailer's market position and valuation. According to InvestingPro data, Costco boasts a significant market capitalization of $399.64 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at a high 55.9, which, while indicative of investor confidence, also points to a premium valuation relative to near-term earnings growth. This is further emphasized by a PEG ratio of 2.86, suggesting that the market may be pricing in optimistic growth expectations. Costco's revenue growth remains healthy, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a gross profit margin of 12.5%, which, although solid, may be considered modest in comparison to some industry peers. It's also noteworthy that Costco has maintained dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, with a recent dividend yield of 0.51% and a 13.73% dividend growth in the same period. This consistent return to shareholders reflects the company's financial health and disciplined capital management. InvestingPro Tips highlight that while Costco is trading at high earnings and EBITDA valuation multiples, it holds more cash than debt, indicating a strong balance sheet. Additionally, the company's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, providing further evidence of its financial stability. For those seeking more in-depth analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, with a total of 15 tips available that delve into Costco's performance and market valuation. Costco's strategic positioning as a prominent player in the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry, combined with its strong return over the last year, suggests that the company is well-equipped to navigate market challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Title: Carlyle joins list of possible Thames Water rescue backers

Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will appoint an independent monitor to Thames Water as soon as next week as the utility inches closer to collapse, Sky News understands. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 28 September 2024 16:09, UK Carlyle, the American investment giant, has become the latest global fund to weigh an investment in Thames Water as the stricken utility races to avoid being nationalised. Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which has roughly $435bn in assets under management, is at the very preliminary stages of assessing whether an investment in Thames Water Utilities Limited (TWUL) would be viable. Britain's biggest water and wastewater company, which has about 16 million customers, is edging towards the brink of collapse after warning in recent days that its financial liquidity is set to expire months earlier than previously anticipated. It has also seen its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by two leading rating agencies. Carlyle is one of a long list of prospective investors approached by Rothschild, the investment bank advising Thames Water's board, as the utility scrambles to raise more than ¬£3bn in the coming months. This weekend, people close to the process confirmed that Carlyle had been approached but said it was "too early" to judge whether the firm might participate in a rescue deal through one or more of its funds. Among the others sounded out by Rothschild are Brookfield, the Canadian investment giant, and Global Infrastructure Partners, which is now owned by BlackRock. BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes Uncomfortable truth is that Thames Water's fate may be out of existing management's hands Thames Water lines up court dates to push through huge debt restructuring Many investors and industry analysts believe, however, that the Rothschild-led process is destined to fail given the massive financial restructuring which faces Thames Water. The company has about ¬£16bn in debt, with approximately ¬£10bn of that accounted for by a group of 90 funds which have appointed Jefferies and Akin Gump to represent them. That syndicate is now preparing its own rescue plan in the coming weeks, which is likely to include an enormous debt-for-equity swap that would wipe out the existing shareholders. Thames Water's future remains so shrouded in uncertainty because the industry watchdog, Ofwat, has rejected the company's initial spending plans for the next five-year regulatory period. The company is now engaged in discussions with Ofwat ahead of its final determination in December. A bridging loan of about ¬£1bn is being contemplated by some of Thames Water's creditors, but some stakeholders remain sceptical that any new financing will be forthcoming without greater regulatory certainty. "Until the lenders know what they are bridging to, the concern deepens that they risk throwing good money after bad," said one fund. TWUL's board is said to have met in the last 48 hours to discuss the implications of its latest rating downgrades and impending liquidity shortfall. One creditor said that Ofwat was expected to appoint an independent monitor next week to scrutinise the company's progress against its turnaround plan. Ofwat, which signalled in August that it would make such an appointment, declined to comment. If new investment into Thames Water is not forthcoming before it runs out of cash, the government will have little choice but to sanction the temporary nationalisation of the company. This would be done through a Special Administration Regime (SAR), a procedure tested only once before when Bulb Energy collapsed in 2021. As part of its contingency planning for implementing a far-reaching restructuring, Thames Water has booked court dates in November to progress a rescue deal. A source close to the company said that Thames Water "continues to look at all options for extending its liquidity and raising new equity". "Reserving court dates is sensible forward planning and a part of keeping all options open."

Title: Jonathan Skrmetti‚Äôs Top 5 Successes as Tennessee‚Äôs Attorney General

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) Audrey Streb Audrey Streb is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation. As Tennessee‚Äôs attorney general for only two years, Republican Jonathan Skrmetti is racking up wins for conservatives in policy and law against the Biden-Harris administration and private sector actors. One of those successes looms at the U.S. Supreme Court, where in the term that begins Oct. 1 the justices are expected to take up the federal government‚Äôs attempt to kill a Tennessee law restricting gender transitions for children. In the case, called United States v. Jonathan Skrmetti, the high court will hear arguments and then decide whether the Tennessee law violates the Constitution in attempting to protect minors subjected to dangerous, life-altering medical procedures. ‚ÄúTwenty-five different states have enacted similar, and in some cases, identical laws,‚Äù Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. The Tennessee ban is ‚Äúvery logical, very reasonable, and very constitutional,‚Äù Perry said, noting that Skrmetti is ‚Äúworking overtime to defend children.‚Äù The state law bans puberty blockers, hormones, and gender-transition surgeries for minors. In court filings, Skrmetti and other Tennessee officials argued that gender-reassignment surgery on minors has ‚Äúexploded‚Äù in recent years and that these procedures are ‚Äúunproven and risky.‚Äù Skrmetti, now 47, was sworn in as attorney general on Sept. 1, 2022. Married and the father of four, the Franklin resident previously was chief deputy attorney general under his predecessor, Herbert H. Slatery III, for three years. Mr. President, no matter the intention, changes to the law must come from Congress ‚Äî not from agency bureaucrats.Separation of powers is the fundamental principle of American government. https://t.co/pyYWfs10HM Skrmetti also was chief counsel to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a fellow Republican. ‚ÄúHis reputation is really stellar,‚Äù Heritage‚Äôs Perry said of Skrmetti, calling him ‚Äúan excellent attorney general who is highly revered.‚Äù Skrmetti received degrees from George Washington University, the University of Oxford, and Harvard Law School. Unlike in other states, Tennessee‚Äôs chief law enforcement officer is appointed by the state Supreme Court for an eight-year term, rather than elected by voters for a four-year term. (The office, whose official title is attorney general and reporter, is thus part of Tennessee‚Äôs judicial branch rather than its executive branch.) Aides and other admirers say that as attorney general, Skrmetti has spearheaded successful lawsuits against the federal government, especially leading the charge against gender ideology mandates and government overreach. Here‚Äôs a look at what they characterize as some of his biggest challenges and successes. Skrmetti‚Äôs duties as attorney general include protecting the state‚Äôs consumers, and supporters say he has risen to that task. Skrmetti filed a lawsuit against one of the world‚Äôs largest asset managers, BlackRock Inc., in a ‚Äúfirst-of-its-kind‚Äù consumer protection case. Tennessee successfully sued BlackRock over misleading statements about its use of ESG standards (for environmental, social, and governance considerations) in investments. Ordinary shareholders argue that ESG standards elevate over ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù and other progressive causes over profitability and good business practices. Skrmetti has been at the forefront of battles with progressives over gender ideology, most notably foiling the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs proposed Title IX changes. The administration‚Äôs adjustments would have mandated that biological boys be allowed to play girls sports at school and to use girls‚Äô restrooms and locker rooms, among other things. Despite facing several challenges from the Biden-Harris Justice Department, Skrmetti successfully defended Tennessee‚Äôs ban on so-called gender-affirming care for children. This is the case pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. The attorney general also won a U.S. District Court case against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which sought to mandate that medical providers perform, and insurers cover, some sex-change procedures. Skrmetti also went to the District Court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to successfully defend Tennessee‚Äôs policy forbidding a change in the biological sex listed on birth certificates. Skrmetti also has had success in responding to the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs undoing of border security measures imposed by the Trump-Pence administration. He sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border-related agencies, over its refusal to share records regarding the ‚Äúcatch and release‚Äù of illegal aliens who were transported to Tennessee. The case is called Tennessee v. Mayorkas, after DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Early this year, Skrmetti successfully sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its revised regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The agency‚Äôs revision would have forced employers to pay for their employees‚Äô abortions, he argued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to lead the coalition fighting to protect the rule of law against this unconstitutional federal overreach,‚Äù Skrmetti said in a public statement. ‚ÄúCongress passed the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect mothers-to-be and promote healthy pregnancies, and the EEOC‚Äôs attempt to rewrite that law into an abortion mandate is illegal.‚Äù When it comes to government and private sector policies focused on or mandating so-called DEI‚Äîdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚ÄîSkrmetti has been proactive in expressing concerns. The Tennessee attorney general last year co-led a 13-state letter that warned Fortune 100 companies about DEI practices setting up racial preferences in hiring, promotions, and other decisions. ‚ÄúAs the Supreme Court recently emphasized, both our Constitution and our civil rights laws guarantee every American the right to be free from racial discrimination,‚Äù Skrmetti said in a press release. ‚ÄúThe court‚Äôs reasoning means that companies, no matter their motivation, cannot treat people differently based on the color of their skin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCorporate America continues to have many avenues to help disadvantaged people and communities of all races without resorting to crude racial line-drawing. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That‚Äôs because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Bitcoin Bitcoin and crypto prices have surged this week, climbing as traders brace for a major earthquake. Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains" in the aftermath of bitcoin's halving earthquake! The bitcoin price has more than doubled over the last year, pushed higher by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto‚Äîwith a surprise BlackRock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) price shock just around the corner. Now, as fears are swirling the U.S. dollar is on "the verge of a total collapse," BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (Buidl) is being used to back a new stablecoin, described as a "key milestone" in the "$16 trillion by 2030" race to tokenize finance. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex‚ÄîA daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has helped spark a crypto revolution on Wall Street with his ... [+] embrace of bitcoin‚Äîpushing the bitcoin price sharply higher. Crypto company Ethena, which earlier this year launched a so-called synthetic U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDe that's swelled to a $2.6 billion circulating supply, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will invest its reserves in BlackRock's Buidl via real-world asset tokenization platform Securitize. "UStb will be fully backed by Blackrock Buidl in partnership with Securitize, enabling a separate fiat stablecoin product alongside USDe," EthenaÔªø's official X account posted. "As the largest tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund with over $522 million in assets, Buidl provides UStb with a secure foundation," Securitize's account posted. "This collaboration represents a key milestone in the evolution of tokenized finance, bringing together leading innovations in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization." In May, BlackRock led a $47 million strategic investment in its Buidl partner Securitize, widely seen as a long-term bet on crypto, with the fund allowing investors within crypto ecosystems to earn dividends on the Treasury fund while keeping assets on-chain. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold‚Äù and a "legitimate" financial instrument. Sign up now for CryptoCodex‚ÄîA free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this year, helped by BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto. Fink revealed last year that he believes the tokenization of assets on blockchains will drive a "revolution" on Wall Street, as everything‚Äîfrom stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit‚Äîbecomes tokenized. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock‚Äôs global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune in May. "Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy." Earlier this month, a report from crypto company Chainlink found the current value of tokenized assets is almost $120 billion, with ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, holding 58% of all tokenized assets. In 2022, Boston Consulting Group found "the total size of illiquid asset tokenization globally would be $16 trillion by 2030," while in 2021, the World Economic Forum estimated that "$867 trillion of value is ready to be disrupted by tokenization."

September 28, 2024 08:07 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the ‚ÄúClass Period‚Äù), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs‚Äô Bar. Many of the firm‚Äôs attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike‚Äôs customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor‚Äôs ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: ‚ÄòThis is the last Bitcoin halving that matters‚Äô ‚Äì Exec

Here‚Äôs why this crypto VC founder believes this might be last important BTC halving. Previous Bitcoin halving cycles have been followed by BTC‚Äôs price rallying explosively. This phenomenon has made most cycle analysts and the overall market expect a parabolic price rally after every event. According to a recent Blackrock report, BTC‚Äôs value has risen by 592x since its debut in 2009. Subsequent exponential returns were recorded after each of the past three halving events too. In 2013, for instance, BTC saw 555x returns, while in 2017, investors saw 104x gains. After the 2020 halving, it posted another 21x returns. And, the trend is expected to repeat after 2024‚Äôs event. Source: BlackRock However, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto VC firm Capriole Investments, believes this might be the last halving event that drives a parabolic BTC rally. He said, ‚ÄúThis is the last Halving cycle that matters.‚Äù Edwards argued that the next halving cycle won‚Äôt impact BTC because it‚Äôs already the hardest asset, with a very low inflation rate below gold. ‚ÄúThe next halving won‚Äôt matter much because the inflation rate of BTC is below gold. So, a massive price drop won‚Äôt affect it much.‚Äù Edwards acknowledged though that the current cycle is not yet priced amid potential nation-state adoption. However, he noted that the halving cycles will be irrelevant by 2028. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to get massive price rallies because the halving events are so well known, and the BTC mining industry is so efficient now. I think the 4-year halving cycles will not be relevant in four years.‚Äù Here, it‚Äôs worth noting that market cycle analyst Stockmoney Lizards projected a possible price target of $200k‚Äî$260k per BTC for this cycle top. This could happen by Q4 2025. Source: X In short, there is still more room for BTC growth before it hit this cycle top. The world‚Äôs largest digital asset retested $66k on Friday and was valued at $65.9k at press time. That puts it only 8% away from its range-high at $71k.

U.Today - Michael Saylor, Bitcoin permabull and the co-founder of MicroStrategy juggernaut that stacks BTC, has published a tweet to highlight Bitcoin‚Äôs high performance, which has massively surpassed that of leading assets in conventional financial markets. Over the past few days, digital gold has demonstrated an increase of more than 5%, reclaiming the $66,000 price mark. As of September this year, BTC shows annual gains of 51%. The second largest after it comes the Magnificent 7 stocks index (which includes such monsters as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) with 27%, followed by S&P 500 (14% rise), real estate (10% increase) and gold (7%). As for the market of bonds, it has entered the red zone, plunging by 4%. Highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs success, Saylor tweeted, ‚ÄúBitcoin is winning.‚Äù On Friday, Saylor reacted to Bitcoin recapturing $66,000 by publishing a tweet saying ‚ÄúBitcoin is Storm-Proof.‚Äù He also responded to a tweet by a renowned investor Raoul Pal after Pal stated that his core crypto bets include SOL and DOGE. Saylor stated that ‚ÄúBitcoin misses‚Äù Pal, to which the investor replied that while he still believes in Bitcoin 1,000%, he looks for assets that can bring large profits quickly, even if high risks are involved. Since Wednesday last week, Bitcoin has added more than 10%, soaring from $59,410 after the Fed Reserve announced a 50 basis point interest rate cut first time in the last four years. This was the initial driver of the Bitcoin price, followed by a similar announcement by the Central Bank of China and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) purchasing a mammoth amount of Bitcoin this week. In the past four days, its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has seen consecutive inflows of $388.19 million in total. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Meta Debuts the Quest 3S, Its Cheapest Mixed-Reality Headset

Time Published: 2024-09-28T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
Meta announced several products at its Meta Connect 2024 event in California, but Quest 3S stood out for many reasons. It‚Äôs the company‚Äôs cheapest mixed-reality headset, featuring a similar chipset (Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) and software functionalities as the older and pricier Meta Quest 3. Meta Quest 3S features a refreshed Meta Horizon OS that better supports 2D applications. Meta says the new OS will also deliver improved spatial audio and better Passthrough contrast and color. The new Quest 3S is compatible with all applications and games in the Meta Store. Also, the headset comes bundled with exclusive games (like Batman: Arkham Shadow) and Quest 3-specific performance updates. Despite sharing a similar form factor, the Quest 3S and Quest 3 have varying display quality, optical lenses, and camera setups. The new Quest 3S has its sensors and Fresnel lenses arranged in triangular clusters, while the Quest 3‚Äôs Pancake lenses and sensors have a pill-shaped setup. Additionally, Quest 3 has a better display (2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye) and will provide more realistic graphics and sharper videos than the Quest 3S (1832 x 1920 pixels per eye). The Quest 3 remains Meta‚Äôs most powerful mixed-reality headset. However, the new Quest 3S doesn‚Äôt seem like a watered-down version, especially spec-wise. Quest 3S starts at $299.99 for the base (128GB) version and $399.99 for 256GB, while the 512GB version will retail for $499.99. Interested buyers can pre-order the Quest 3S from Meta‚Äôs website before it hits the shelves on October 15. In other news, the retail price for the 512GB Meta Quest 3 is dropping from $649.99 to $499.99. Meta is also discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro. The company says it‚Äôll sell whatever‚Äôs left of both models through the end of 2024 or until they‚Äôre out of stock. According to Meta, the new Quest 3S will provide outstanding value ‚Äúboth for those new to VR and those looking to upgrade from Quest or Quest 2.

Here's your firmware update for September 28, 2024 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. What a week this was, folks. Meta Connect 2024 introduced us to a new VR headset, its first AR glasses prototype and slew of Meta AI upgrades ‚Äì including an in-development skill to live dub Instagram reels. We also said hello to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, reviewed the new Legend of Zelda title, and prepared ourselves for heartbreak in 2025 with the arrival of The Last of Us season 2's first teaser trailer. In case you missed all that, we've rounded up all of these top tech news stories below so you can get up to speed on everything that happened in the last seven days. On Tuesday (September 24), Nothing unveiled its inaugural set of open-ear buds and TechRadar‚Äôs audio editor couldn‚Äôt help but share her initial thoughts. She‚Äôd already said she thought it was the best idea Nothing's had in ages (questionable ‚ÄòEar Open‚Äô moniker aside), and after slipping them on for a few hours, they didn‚Äôt disappoint. Ear Open are so very Nothing; their friendly praying mantis aesthetic is so very likeable. And just as the company's Nothing Ear (a) impressed for a competitive fee, these buds are likely to be a huge hit in the open-ear space. That's particularly true given that they cost just ¬£129, ie. the same price as the flagship Nothing Ear (which means your US and Australian prices are almost certainly $149 / AU$249). Compare that to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, with their $299 / ¬£299 / AU$449.95 price-point. See? Slip 'em on and they feel like nothing, too. The fit is excellent ‚Äì even putting both on at the same time is a cinch. You get the trademark transparent-meets-monochrome-meets-titanium Nothing design language, plus on-ear pinch control, although there‚Äôs a knack to it now, purely because you need to locate where the old 'stem' idea is, to pinch. Oh, and the Advanced EQ setting? It's another level‚Ä¶ We won't be surprised if not too many Nintendo fans are reading this, because right now they're probably all playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. This highly anticipated entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise is something of a landmark, letting players explore Hyrule through the eyes of Princess Zelda for the first time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And the good news is that it's great. It combines elements from classic Zelda titles with a wealth of new mechanics for an adventure quite unlike anything that we‚Äôve seen before. Tasked with closing sinister rifts that threaten the kingdom, you journey through a charming open-world and experiment with a suite of magical abilities. These let you create copies of certain objects whenever you need, which is just as fun as it sounds; a summoned bed might be good for a quick nap in isolation, but makes for the perfect bridge over a perilous chasm when multiplied and stacked. You can even spawn friendly versions of enemies to fight on your behalf. It‚Äôs all wrapped up in an adorable art direction, making everything from the characters to the world look like it was plucked straight from a cute diorama. Check out our review below. This week we were treated to our first new trailer for The Last of Us season 2, and we‚Äôre convinced it's going to be as emotionally devastating as the videogame it‚Äôs based on. Released as part of this year‚Äôs The Last of Us Day celebrations (September 26 is the day the Cordyceps infection ravaged the world of the game/show) we got both a two-minute S2 teaser and a confirmation that it‚Äôs coming sometime in 2025. The teaser gives us our first glimpse of characters players know from the games, including Abby and Ellie's love interest Dina, as well as providing hints at what Ellie and Joel have been up to following the 'five years of peace' that followed the events of season 1. Fans of the games know it‚Äôs not all sunshine and roses for the survivors, though, so we‚Äôre going to take these next few months to emotionally prepare ourselves for what The Last of Us has in store for us come 2025. Samsung launched the Galaxy S24 FE alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra this week, and the new phone looks like it‚Äôll prove the cheapest route into Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy AI ecosystem. Among the S24 FE‚Äôs hardware upgrades over the Galaxy S23 FE are a bigger 6.7-inch display, a new Exynos 2400e chipset, and longer battery life. But while that would be enough to make it a contender in the cheap flagship stakes, it's the phone's AI tricks that we're most excited about. Chief among them are its AI-powered ProVisual photography engine, which it inherits from the standard Galaxy S24 and which should bring improved low-light performance and optical zoom quality. In our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE review, we described Samsung‚Äôs new device as ‚Äúa great value phone for its power and features,‚Äù so here‚Äôs hoping it lives up to that billing once we‚Äôve put it through our full review process. 3. Meta‚Äôs affordable Meta Quest 3S broke cover The least surprising announcement of Meta Connect 2024 was nevertheless an exciting one ‚Äì the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S. This affordable alternative to the Meta Quest 3 still packs a solid punch with its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, and 8GB of RAM, but only costs $299.99 / ¬£289.99 / AU$499.99. In exchange you will have to accept a couple of downgrades ‚Äì less sharp displays, a bulkier body, and the loss of the depth sensor ‚Äì but by all accounts the Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset at its price, and looks like it could be perfect for people looking to dip their toes into XR as we head into the holiday season. We also saw Meta‚Äôs first fully functional AR glasses ‚Äì the Orion prototypes. These aren‚Äôt something anyone will be able to buy (though some are being given out as developer kits to help software creators make apps for the official specs), but from what we‚Äôve been shown Orion looks amazing. And it‚Äôs only set to get better, with Mark Zuckerberg promising the consumer pair will boast better displays, a more fashionable design, and a more affordable price. Although on that last point, Meta‚Äôs CTO Andrew Bosworth later clarified that Meta meant affordable in terms of smartphone and laptops rather than at ‚Äúa Quest 3S price point, or even a Quest 3 price point.‚Äù It suddenly feels rather like 2020 all over again. That's because pre-orders for the forthcoming PS5 Pro and the limited-edition PS5 30th Anniversary Collection went on sale this week ‚Äì with predictable results. Such as? Well, such as the official PlayStation Direct website quickly being inundated with would-be buyers all eager to get their hands on Sony‚Äôs upcoming consoles and kit.

Title: Grayscale‚Äôs Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/grayscales-bullish-forecast-the-top-20-crypto-to-watch-in-q4/

Crypto asset manager Grayscale has published an in-depth report outlining sectors poised for bullish growth in the final quarter of the year amid a notable recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for major players such as Bitcoin (BTC) and various altcoins, which have reached price levels not seen in over two months. In its Thursday report, Grayscale updated its Crypto Sectors Indexes, showcasing emerging themes within the digital asset industry. Key trends include the rise of decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, efforts to tokenize traditional assets, and the growing popularity of memecoins. Notably, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector have outperformed other market segments in 2024, likely due to the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US earlier this year and favorable macroeconomic conditions following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) interest rate cut on 18 September. While gaining 13% this year, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin but still surpassed many other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale‚Äôs Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI) has seen a slight decline of about 1% year-to-date, with the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index down approximately 11%, making Ethereum‚Äôs performance relatively stronger than its peers. Despite its challenges, the asset manager finds that Ethereum remains the Smart Contract Platforms sector leader, boasting the highest number of applications, developers, and fee revenue. In producing its quarterly Top 20 list of cryptocurrencies, Grayscale thoroughly analyzes hundreds of digital assets. This list represents a diversified selection of assets with high potential for the upcoming quarter. Among those highlighted by the firm are standout performers such as Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Optimism (OP), Helium (HNT), Celo (CELO) and the UMA Protocol (UMA). However, below is the full list with other assets beyond these to which Grayscale pays particular attention. Sui, a third-generation blockchain created by former Meta engineers, has made waves following a recent network upgrade that enhanced its transaction speed by 80%, surpassing Solana‚Äôs capabilities. Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, plays a critical role in scaling the Ethereum network. It has developed a framework called the ‚ÄúSuperchain,‚Äù which is utilized by platforms like Coinbase‚Äôs Layer 2 BASE. Celo and UMA are capitalizing on unique trends, with Celo focusing on stablecoin use and payment solutions in developing regions, particularly in Africa. The platform recently surpassed Tron in stablecoin usage, while UMA serves as an oracle network for decentralized applications like Polymarket. Helium‚Äôs inclusion in the Top 20 reflects Grayscale‚Äôs preference for category leaders with sustainable revenue models. The project has established itself as a leader in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), growing its network to over one million hotspots and generating significant fee revenues. Bittensor, which focuses on the intersection of AI and crypto, has recently gained recognition within Grayscale‚Äôs framework due to improvements in market structure, offering a decentralized platform for AI innovation. In this quarter‚Äôs adjustments, Grayscale has rotated out several assets, including Render, Mantle, ThorChain, Pendle, Illuvium, and Raydium. While Grayscale sees value in these projects, the revised Top 20 list aims to offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for investors in the coming months. At the time of writing, the biggest winner across all time frames in Grayscale‚Äôs top 20 list is Bittensor‚Äôs TAO token, which has seen gains of 86% over the fourteen-day time frame and a substantial 841% year-to-date, resulting in a current trading price of $536.

In a recent move, Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa) has sold a significant portion of its shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:NYSE:BAC). The transaction, which took place over a series of days, resulted in the sale of over $460 million worth of Bank of America stock. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $39.2728 to $39.5226. The sale began on September 25, 2024, with 2,305,415 shares sold at a weighted average price of $39.2728. The selling continued on September 26, with an additional 5,457,825 shares sold at an average price of $39.4641. The final day of sales, September 27, saw 3,915,126 shares sold at a weighted average price of $39.5226. The transactions were disclosed in a recent SEC filing by Berkshire Hathaway, which is led by the renowned investor Warren E. Buffett. Following these transactions, Berkshire Hathaway's remaining holdings in Bank of America amount to 802,668,860 shares. The sales represent a significant divestment but indicate that Berkshire Hathaway still maintains a substantial stake in the financial institution. Investors and market watchers closely monitor the investment moves of Berkshire Hathaway, particularly those involving large stakes in major corporations like Bank of America. The company's investment decisions, often seen as a signal of Buffett's confidence in the market and specific companies, are followed as indicators of broader market trends. The SEC filing included footnotes detailing the price ranges of the shares sold and affirmed the company's commitment to providing full information on the number of shares sold at each separate price within the stated range upon request. Additionally, the footnotes clarified the ownership nature of the shares, indicating that the shares are indirectly owned by Berkshire Hathaway through its subsidiaries. The recent transactions underscore the dynamic nature of Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy and its ongoing management of a diverse portfolio. As of the latest filing, the exact reasons behind the sales or future investment strategies regarding Bank of America remain undisclosed. In other recent news, Bank of America's CFO, Alastair Borthwick, expressed optimism about the Federal Reserve's efforts in tackling inflation, following a significant reduction in interest rates. In other developments, David Dowd has been appointed as the new president of Bank of America's Asheville market, signaling a continued commitment to local integration and community engagement. Deutsche Bank upgraded Bank of America's stock from Hold to Buy, citing potential for revenue growth, while Piper Sandler maintained a neutral rating. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has continued to reduce its stake in Bank of America, selling shares worth nearly $7 billion since mid-July. Despite this, Berkshire remains the bank's largest shareholder. A recent Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates is anticipated to alleviate the financial burden on borrowers and lower deposit costs for banks, potentially reducing loan default risks. This development has been welcomed by the banking sector. Furthermore, BofA Securities initiated coverage of BrainBees Solutions Ltd, commonly known as FirstCry, with a Buy rating and a target price of $770, citing strong growth outlook in the Indian mother and baby care market.

According to InvestingPro data, Bank of America boasts a market capitalization of $306.66 billion, underlining its position as a major player in the industry. The bank's P/E ratio of 13.78 suggests that it may be reasonably valued compared to its peers. This valuation metric, coupled with the bank's price-to-book ratio of 1.14, indicates that investors are not paying an excessive premium for the company's assets. InvestingPro Tips highlight Bank of America's commitment to shareholder returns. The company has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years. This consistent dividend policy aligns with Berkshire Hathaway's preference for companies that provide steady returns to shareholders. Despite Berkshire's recent stock sale, Bank of America's financial health appears robust. The company has been profitable over the last twelve months, with analysts predicting continued profitability this year. This positive outlook is supported by the bank's operating income margin of 31.39% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024.

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ¬©2024 GPlusMedia Inc. From disinformation campaigns to soaring skepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media landscape has been hit with blow after blow. World News Day, taking place on Saturday with the support of hundreds of organizations including AFP, aims to raise awareness about the challenges endangering the hard-pressed industry. In 2022, UNESCO warned that "the business model of the news media is broken". Advertising revenue -- the lifeline of news publications -- has dried up in recent years, with internet giants such as Google and Facebook owner Meta soaking up half of that spending, the report said. Meta, Amazon and Google's parent company Alphabet alone account for 44 percent of global ad spend, while only 25 percent goes to traditional media organisations, according to a study by the World Advertising Research Center. Platforms like Facebook "are now explicitly deprioritising news and political content", the Reuters Institute's 2024 Digital News Report pointed out. Traffic from social to news sites has sharply declined as a result, causing a drop in revenue. Few are keen to pay for news. Only 17 percent of people polled across 20 wealthy countries said they had online news subscriptions in 2023. Such trends, leading to rising costs, have resulted in "layoffs, closures, and other cuts" in media organizations around the world, the study found. Public trust in the media has increasingly eroded in recent years. Only four in 10 respondents said they trusted news most of the time, the Reuters Institute reported. Meanwhile, young people are relying more on influencers and content creators than newspapers to stay informed. For them, video is king, with the study citing the influence of TikTok and YouTube stars such as American Vitus Spehar and Frenchman Hugo Travers, known for his channel HugoDecrypte. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed concerns about disinformation -- rife on social platforms -- as the tool can generate convincing text and images. In the United States, partisan websites masquerading as media outlets now outnumber American newspaper sites, the research group NewsGuard, which tracks misinformation, said in June. "Pink slime" outlets -- politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets -- are largely powered by AI. This appears to be an effort to sway political beliefs ahead of the US election. As part of a national crackdown on disinformation, Brazil's Supreme Court suspended access to Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter. The court accused the social media platform of refusing to remove accounts charged with spreading fake news, and flouting other judicial rulings. "Eradicating disinformation seems impossible, but things can be implemented," Reporters Without Borders (RSF) editorial director Anne Bocande told AFP. Platforms can bolster regulation and create news reliability indicators, like RSF's Journalism Trust Initiative, Bocande said. AI has pushed news media into unchartered territory. US streaming platform Peacock introduced AI-generated custom match reports during the Paris Olympics this year, read with the voice of sports commentator Al Michaels -- fuelling fears AI could replace journalists. Despite these concerns, German media giant Axel Springer has decided to bet on AI while refocusing on its core news activities. At its roster, which includes Politico, the Bild tabloid, Business Insider and Die Welt daily, AI will focus on menial production tasks so journalists can dedicate their time to reporting and securing scoops. In a bid to profit from the technology's rise, the German publisher as well as The Associated Press and The Financial Times signed content partnerships with start-up OpenAI. But the Microsoft-backed firm is also caught in a major lawsuit with The New York Times over copyright violations. With journalists frequently jailed, killed and attacked worldwide, "repression is a major issue," said RSF's Bocande. A total of 584 journalists are languishing behind bars because of their work -- with China, Belarus and Myanmar the world's most prolific jailers of reporters. The war in Gaza sparked by Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel has already left a "terrible" mark on press freedom, Bocande added. More than 130 journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since October 7, 2023, including 32 while "in the exercise of their duties". She said a "quiet repression" campaign is underway in countries around the world, including in democracies -- with investigative journalism hampered by fresh laws on national security. A treasure trove of adventures awaits in the Green Season, where the northern summer lasts longer and where there's an activity for everyone in the family. Sponsored by Hilton Niseko Village It's partly a lack of trust, partly an attempt to avoid the endless toxic, depression-inducing stream of bad news, war crimes, moral panics, activist demands, nudge unit manipulation, propaganda and geopolitical posturing, laced with threats of an imminent climate apocalypse and nuclear war. fake news - bad times? good for us. tired from your lies. It takes money to do real journalism as opposed to hosting Russian/Chinese disinformation. When the corporate controlled media in cahoots with the government are the ones propagating the misinformation. No wonder the legacy media is quickly becoming passe. And their response is to double down and try to control us even more. If you have some people telling you what is misformation, you can be sure those people will tell their side of story, no one can be judge and party. How X.com or Israel are pointed out as enemies while they are fighting for freedom of speech and against terrorism ? Please explain. Steve Balmer is taking his news from X...and all politicians are using it to promote their agenda. No censorship shall be the norm for democracies. Given the evident bias in media reporting, such as calling Argentina‚Äôs Milei ‚Äúfar-right‚Äù, and prefixing any report of something Trump says with ‚Äúfalsely claimed‚Äù, or ‚Äúwithout evidence‚Äù, I am less likely to pay for the current media options than ever. I am the one who decides (for me) what is false, evidence, and ‚Äúfar-right‚Äù, or loony left. This is why we have juries to judge people when they are out on trial for alleged crimes - not just turned over to some faceless body that shall decide. Some people I used to see in the legacy media have started up their own platforms so they can speak directly what they think. I would rather listen to honest opinions that I disagree with than curated propaganda. Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Title: Everything Meta Announced At Connect 2024
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-2024-everything-announced/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T21:26:54Z
Full Content:
Meta announced so much at its Connect 2024 conference that you may have missed some of it. But never fear! Here's a brief summary of every important Meta Connect 2024 announcement. For full context and details, read the articles linked. Meta launched a new headset, simplified its Quest 3 lineup, discontinued Quest 2 and Quest Pro, and launched new official accessories. After months of leaks, Meta finally announced its new headset: Quest 3S. Effectively, Quest 3S is a cheaper Quest 3 with a bulkier design, inferior lens clarity, and lower resolution. Quest 3S has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and fixed single panel from Quest 2 to achieve a starting price of $300. All purchases of Quest 3S until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Meta is discontinuing the 128GB base model of Quest 3 and cutting the other 512GB model to its $500 price. Until stock is gone, the 128GB model is on clearance sale for $430. Like with Quest 3S, all purchases of Quest 3 until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Quest 2 was the first mainstream VR headset and Quest Pro was an innovative failure. Quest 3S will take Quest 2's place in Meta's lineup. But there's no direct replacement for Quest Pro. When it's gone, Meta will no longer offer a headset with eye tracking or face tracking. One aspect of Quest Pro that Meta will offer a replacement for is its open periphery design, because it's releasing an official Open Facial Interface for Quest 3. Instead of being a halo strap, the official Open Facial Interface still presses against your face. But the space between the interface and the headset itself is empty, allowing you to see the real world. Quest 3S is getting its own exclusive facial interface accessory. The "Breathable" Facial Interface makes the tradeoff of not being opaque to "help you keep cool while working out or playing intense games". You can now buy the Logitech MX Ink tracked stylus for Quest headsets. Logitech MX Ink is designed for both 2D drawing on a physical surface via its pressure-sensitive tip and for 3D creativity via full 6DoF positional tracking (via the headset cameras), multiple buttons, and a haptic feedback actuator. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be: Official YouTube cowatching will finally launch as a beta next week. YouTube cowatching will take place in Horizon Home, meaning you'll see other people as their Meta Avatar alongside you. Quest 3 owners in the US can try photorealistic scenes via Meta's new Horizon Hyperscape demo app. UploadVR's Don Hopper tried Horizon Hyperscape and found it to be significantly higher quality than Gracia, with a "stark difference" in visual clarity. Amazon launched an all-new Prime Video Quest app that supports passthrough and downloads. Prime Video is the first major streaming service officially available on Horizon OS to support downloads, making it ideal for use on airplanes with the Travel Mode Quest headsets now have since May. Quest headsets will be able to extend Windows 11 laptops by just looking at them, without installing any software, later this year. Meta says this will be possible thanks to a partnership with Microsoft. Your laptop's screen will turn off and be replaced by a giant virtual screen, and you'll be able to spawn entirely virtual extra monitors. The new Meta Avatars system with overhauled graphics will launch on Tuesday. And some time next year, Meta will allow users to generate a new outfit by typing, leveraging generative AI. In Horizon Worlds, Meta says it will also support "fantastical avatars", non-human forms which users can unlock in specific worlds. In a surprise announcement, Meta revealed that it will give developers access to the passthrough cameras of Quest headsets via a new API next year. Meta hasn't yet said whether there'll be any restrictions to the Passthrough API, but we'll keep a close eye on the company for any further details of this exciting upcoming capability, which could unlock entirely new use cases for Quest headsets. Meta says Horizon Worlds creators will be able to add AI NPCs to their worlds next year. These AI NPCs will be able to "engage in conversations, help people out, and even compete in games". Meta teased "the future of Horizon OS", showing a concept of a complete redesign. Meta didn't give even a rough timeline for the new Horizon OS interface, and what was shown appears to be a concept. Triangle Strategy, a turn-based tactical RPG from Square Enix, is being adapted for VR this year on Quest. On Quest, Triangle Strategy's VR adaptation promises a "whole new look" across the battlefield, letting you reach out to units and issue commands directly. Home Sports is a new mixed reality multi-sports game that rolls five sports into one collection on Quest 3. An exact release date remains unconfirmed. Resolution states Home Sports "will be launching soon" for the Meta Quest 3 family. Supernatural Together is a new expansion that adds group-based workouts to the fitness app on Quest. Team Workouts feature special Challenge Zones and Victory Tunnels that "require teamwork and coordination to complete." Meta Horizon Store, the app store on Quest headsets, will allow developers to submit 2D Android apps. Meta will be hoping this brings some of the most useful and entertaining apps from the Google Play Store. However, the lack of Google Play Services will make it challenging for some apps to be ported. Meta Spatial SDK lets developers easily build apps for Quest's Horizon OS with traditional mobile development tools, without a game engine. It provides rendering, optional passthrough, controller and hand tracking, support for flatscreen and immersive media playback, physics, and spatial audio. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are getting a swathe of new software features, as well as new transitions lenses styles. The following features are coming "soon": And these features are coming "later this year": Further, EssilorLuxottica and Meta launched new style options with Transitions lenses: Meta showed off integrated prototype AR glasses with a field of view that's remarkable given their form factor. However, the Orion glasses won't be sold as a product, as Meta admitted each costs on the order of $10,000 to produce. The company said Orion will be used as a demonstrator and internal development kit, describing it as "a time machine that lets us live in the future".

Title: 20 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-geopolitical-events-highest-impact-211037361.html
Time Published: 2024-09-27T21:10:33Z
Full Content:
In this article, we will look at the 20 geopolitical events with highest impact on S&P 500. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500. The geopolitical events impact the financial markets across the world depending on the nature of the event. The assassination attempt on former US President Donald J. Trump is the latest geopolitical event investors have had to grapple with in recent years, alongside two major wars including Russia-Ukraine and ongoing Israel‚Äôs aggression on Gaza. Wars have far-reaching effects such as an impact on financial markets, in addition to enormous human toll. Geopolitics events that affect the economy drastically caution investors to look for safe haven investments or be out of the market until the situation comes to normal. According to JP Morgan Private Bank‚Äôs recent client survey, 34% of the investors were potentially worried about geopolitical risks, while 29% of investors were bothered by potential recession fears in 2024. Whereas, almost 90% of the geopolitical events have not changed the direction of the world economy, as per Citigroup Inc.‚Äôs Global Wealth Report 2024. Geopolitical events mostly have short-term impacts on global asset prices. However, World War II and the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo had the gravest impact on the financial markets. The 1973 oil shock did have a lasting impact on equity returns. During the first 90 days, the S&P 500 plunged by nearly 13.04%, the highest among geopolitical events since 1940. The oil supply was limited for an extended period, leading to a macro state of ‚Äòstagflation.‚Äô In simple terms, high oil prices essentially stopped the economy from operating efficiently in the 1970s. On the other side, Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine shocked global energy markets in 2022. However, additional oil supply limited the economic and market impact compared to its 1970s counterpart. Today, the US has a more secure oil supply compared to its heavy reliance on the Middle East. In recent times, the rising conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war have had major consequences. The US has been aiding Ukraine and Israel with military assistance. According to the US State Department, the US government has provided more than $55.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine to fight against Russian invasion since the war began in February 2022. Whereas, the US government has supported Israel through legislation providing at least $12.5 billion in military aid, as of April 2024. It has been a see-saw year for the global economies. The intensified conflict in the Middle East may impact oil prices with a potential disruption in regional supply. As of September 23, oil prices have been high as the conflicts soar, and due to last week's outsized US interest rate cut expectations.

Madison Dividend Income Fund pointed out regarding XOM in the Q1 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúOur thesis on XOM is that it will grow production volumes of oil and gas moderately over the next few years, while limiting excessive capital investment that plagued the industry from 2014-2020. Production growth will come from its 2023 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is the largest producer in the Permian basin. XOM plans to double its Permian output by 2027, to 2 million barrels per day. Capital spending will be limited to $20-25 billion per yearthrough 2027, which should allow for significant amounts of cash to be returned to shareholders including a $35 billion share repurchase program and continued dividend increases. Higher oil prices would provide a tailwind to our thesis but are not necessary. We think XOM can grow earnings and cash flow if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel‚Ä¶‚Äù (Click here to read the full text) While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

You are here: Influencer Marketing Hub ¬ª Social Media ¬ª 6 Best Paid Social Marketing Campaigns to Pay Attention to Sure, the great thing about social media marketing is that it‚Äôs essentially free. However, social media networks‚Äô impressive targeting capabilities and wealth of campaign data make them ideal for running paid ads. Plus, when you combine influencer marketing and paid social, you can maximize the reach and impact of your campaigns further. Here are campaign examples of how some of the leading brands have leveraged paid social marketing, along with actionable advice to generate the same level of results. Top Paid Social Media Marketing Examples:1. JBL2. Oscar Mayer3. Lidl 4. Volkswagen5. Warner Bros.6. PricelineHow Can Brands Create Better Paid Social Marketing Campaigns?Key TakeawaysFrequently Asked Questions For an example of how to combine paid social with influencer marketing and use a disruptive product message, there‚Äôs JBL‚Äôs JBLiens Ear-n-vasion campaign which ran in December 2023. Apple has been dominating the true wireless stereo (TWS) market since 2020 and JBL needed to use an unconventional way to cancel the noise that Apple was making. JBL‚Äôs products focus on customization, allowing users to express their individualism and be their authentic selves. To communicate their focus on individualism, JBL worked with Nick Kosir (aka The Dancing Weatherman) who shared sightings of JBLiens, easily observable by their ‚Äúear-dividuality‚Äù as breaking news. A post shared by Nick Kosir (@nickkosir) They also worked with Flyana Boss, an American hip hop duo with nearly half a million YouTube subscribers. In addition to YouTube and Instagram, they also used TikTok. Katie A. Raymond, Director of Strategy, Content, Social Media and Paid Media at HARMAN International, JBL‚Äôs parent company, sums up the campaign‚Äôs success in a LinkedIn post as follows: ‚ÄúThe campaign‚Äôs success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe campaign‚Äôs success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.‚Äù Oscar Mayer, a Kraft Heinz brand that sells meat and cold cuts, brought home the bacon with the #OscarTakeMeToProm campaign. It‚Äôs a great example of how to combine: As part of their marketing efforts, Oscar Mayer uses an iconic wienermobile that gets driven around by their brand ambassadors across America. Each year, they receive several requests for rides in their wiener-on-wheels. These requests typically come from students. Oscar Mayer However, social listening revealed that teens thought that the Wienermobile would make a pretty cool ride to the prom. Oscar Mayer then turned to their group of brand ambassadors to create and share content via their official Oscar Mayer social accounts. Using paid and organic efforts, they launched a UGC contest on Instagram and TikTok. The campaign did exceptionally well on Instagram. It generated a 65% increase in reach on Instagram, while the content‚Äôs engagement rate exceeded the platform‚Äôs benchmarks more than 170%. For an example of how to use social media for a holiday campaign, there‚Äôs Lidl GB‚Äôs multi-channel Christmas activation. The discount retailer chain released a spoof of East 17‚Äôs only number-one single, ‚ÄúStay Another Day‚Äù. The campaign parodies both the song and original music video. One of the reasons why this paid social campaign works is because the spoof also features Tony Mortimer, one of the English pop band‚Äôs original members. As Coolr, the social media agency behind this campaign, explains in their ‚ÄúSave Another Way (...the Lidl Way)‚Äù case study, his inclusion works on two levels. It improves the sense of familiarity among viewers as well as adds a type of endorsement. It also works because it combines social good marketing. Aside from promoting their rewards app, Lidl GB also donated ¬£100,000 to NSPCC‚Äôs Childline service. The campaign was run on: It was particularly successful on TikTok and Instagram where it generated nearly 68 million impressions. To maximize reach and awareness on TikTok, the agency used the premium TopView placement on TikTok. The judges of the Global Social Media Awards commended it for its ‚Äúsocial-first approach‚Äù. The content was created with social media in mind from the start. For example, the full, 4-minute music video was uploaded onto YouTube, while a shorter version was shared on TikTok, known for short-form video content. Plus, this way they could also encourage users who watched the short version on TikTok to go to YouTube to watch the longer version. The short version on TikTok generated nearly 1 million clicks to YouTube. PHD, one of the globe‚Äôs media agencies with the most awards (which includes being named Adweek‚Äôs Global Media Agency of the Year), created this campaign for Volkswagen to help them launch their new ID. Buzz. Electric vehicles might be quiet, but the market is noisy. With Volkswagen boasting only a 4.2% share in terms of unit sales, it needed a special force to create a buzz. To do this, they partnered with Disney and Star Wars to connect the automotive brand strategically with these iconic cultural elements. The social strategy used familiar and beloved characters like C-3PO, R2D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ewan McGregor to improve electric vehicle consideration. McGregor also happens to have loved the VW brand since a kid and owns a couple of VW buses, elevating him to a level of brand ambassador. The strategy was adjusted for each social channel. For example, Meta was reserved for video-only campaigns using the platform‚Äôs available video placements. On TikTok, the agency could be slightly more playful. Here, they created a Star Wars community for fans. As two major brands were working together on this campaign and each had their own marketing agency, a solution was needed to collaborate without confidential info getting shared. The Force Is Strong, United! case study shared on The World Media Group‚Äôs website, explains how they created a Data Clean Room directly in PHD‚Äôs planning tool. This way, they could optimize all digital bidding strategies. Using an AI-powered automated process, data could be compared so that bids across both campaigns could be matched to prevent mutual high-bidding effects. The Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs ‚ÄúDid we do ‚ÄòKenough‚Äô‚Äù campaign is another example of how the agency PHD UK used paid social effectively. PHD Linkedin post The strategy included: As a case study of this award-winning campaign explains, the challenge of this campaign was to change the movie‚Äôs perception. Unlike the actual dolls, the movie‚Äôs plot didn‚Äôt have the same target audience. As the movie had a broader appeal, it made PHD UK‚Äôs keyword audience strategy so much more effective. That said, while the plot tackled more serious topics like feminism, the agency found more than ‚Äúkenough‚Äù room to add elements of playfulness. Plus, it also helped to set it apart from Oppenheimer, Barbie the Movie‚Äôs summer release competition sharing the same release date. To do this, all communication touchpoints had to place the movie and its trademark pink into pop culture and be positive. The Drum Like Volkswagen, Priceline also worked with a TV star, Kaley Cuoco, best known for her roles in The Big Bang Theory and The Flight Attendant, for their social media campaign. This way, they could also leverage the Emmy-nominated actress‚Äô huge following on social media. In the ads created as a series of funny episodes, Kaley encourages her coworkers to book their dream vacation by using Priceline‚Äôs affordable travel options. As incentive, more than $5 million in hidden, interactive deals were made available exclusively via social ads, making the campaign a great example of how to add an element of gamification. MIRIMAR If that were not enough to grab attention, each episode features an original theme song. This theme song was also released on streaming platforms. In addition to streaming platforms and social media takeovers on Meta, TikTok, and YouTube, they also used audio and podcast ads. Combine these deals with the original music and travelers were given multiple reasons to break into song. In addition to illustrating the benefit of using elements like music and gamification, this campaign also highlights the importance of target audience research. A survey commissioned by Priceline revealed that 76% of US workers are happier when they travel, yet more than 50% identify price as a reason for not traveling. With this data, they could ensure that the core messaging of their campaign offers a solution to their target audience‚Äôs pain point. These 6 award-winning paid social marketing campaigns highlight a few tips that brands and their marketing teams can use. Here‚Äôs what they teach us: Understanding your target audience is crucial, even more so when you‚Äôre running a paid campaign. Social media platforms have exceptional audience targeting capabilities, but to use it properly you need to know and understand your audience. For example, in the case of the campaign for Barbie‚Äôs movie release, segmenting audiences based on demographics like age was essential. The movie was, in fact, aimed at teens and women, not tweens like the doll. Demographics, though, are only one criteria. The campaign created for Priceline illustrates how knowing your audience‚Äôs pain points are crucial too. You might know who your target audience is, but you can always get to understand them better. Plus, needs and interests change which can impact your campaign‚Äôs approach. In the case of Priceline, a simple survey already revealed key information regarding travelers‚Äô pain points, but you can also use more robust audience research tools like: Depending on your budget, you can incorporate influencer-generated content. According to The Influencer Marketing Factory, 90% of influencer marketing campaigns include paid media. This way, you can add that element of trust and validation which are important to social media users. Another benefit is that you grow your reach. Your ads will grab the attention of the influencer‚Äôs followers too. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to use the likes of Ewan McGregor or Penny from The Big Bang Theory. In fact, our Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report 2024 found that mega/celebrity influencers are used least often. Only 12.9% of brands plan to use mega influencers in 2024, compared to 44% that plan to use mostly nano-influencers. Influencer Preferences Cost isn‚Äôt the only reason. Nano and micro-influencers in some instances have higher engagement rates. This is especially true if you plan on using Instagram or TikTok. Data shared by Captiv8 with EMARKETER reveals that Instagram influencers with fewer than 10,000 followers have the highest engagement rate at 6.23%. On TikTok, the picture looks similar. Here, nano-influencers also have the highest engagement rate, according to Statista‚Äôs numbers. Engagement rate of TikTok influencers worldwide What is essential when selecting influencers is that target audiences must align with the influencer‚Äôs followers. Ideally, there should also be a link between the influencer‚Äôs own interests and that of your product. In the case of Volkswagen‚Äôs campaign, the fact that Ewan McGregor is a longtime Volkswagen driver, helps to create that trust and validation that makes this form of marketing so effective. Crafting successful social ad campaigns requires more than just a budget and creativity. By leveraging analytics tools, you can gain profound insights into your target audience, ensuring your content resonates and engages effectively. Prioritizing social-first content tailored to each platform's unique environment can significantly boost your campaign's performance. For example, on TikTok and Instagram videos designed for mobile viewing are a must. And, if your budget allows it, combine your paid social efforts with influencer marketing. It can amplify your reach and credibility, making your social media ads more impactful. Facebook is considered one of the best social media platforms for paid advertising. It has advanced audience targeting features, various ad formats, and allows for different campaign objectives such as awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales. What‚Äôs more, Facebook is the most-used social media platform worldwide, offering a large and diverse audience for brands to reach. The following are top-rated solutions that use artificial intelligence and can help with paid marketing: To create a budget for paid social ads and your other social media marketing activity, use the following steps: Examples of key performance indicators (KPIs) that you want to monitor are: The following are top-rated digital marketing agencies that include paid social in their services: If trends like #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt tell us anything, it‚Äôs that TikTok influences buying...

Title: From Land Grabbers to Carbon Cowboys: A New Scramble for Community Lands Takes Off

Full Content:
In a recent interview with the New York Times, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was asked if there were types of projects that he would not invest in to offset his greenhouse gas emissions. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt plant trees,‚Äù he replied, adding that planting trees to deal with the climate crisis was complete nonsense. ‚ÄúI mean, are we the science people, or are we the idiots? Which one do we want to be?‚Äù[1] Microsoft, the company he built his fortune on and, according to insiders, still actively advises, sees it differently. In June 2024, the tech giant bought 8 million carbon credits from the Timberland Investment Group (TIG), a fund owned by the Brazilian agribusiness lender BTG Pactual.[2] TIG is raising US$1 billion to buy and convert pasture lands to large-scale eucalyptus plantations across the Southern Cone of Latin America.[3] As these trees grow, they draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their roots, trunks and branches. TIG will estimate the amount of carbon removed and then sell it as carbon credits to Microsoft and other corporations. Each carbon credit that Microsoft buys from TIG is supposed to offset one tonne of the emissions Microsoft generates burning fossil fuels. This is one of the main ways that Microsoft and many other companies are planning on getting to ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù emissions, while still burning fossil fuels. Microsoft‚Äôs deal with TIG, reportedly the largest ‚Äúcarbon dioxide removal credit transaction‚Äù in history, is just one of many investments Microsoft is making in tree plantations as a way to offset its emissions.[4] The Dutch agribusiness lender Rabobank is another source of carbon credits for the tech company. It too is acquiring land in Brazil for tree plantations, in this instance with a local agribusiness family with a track record of illegal deforestation and fraud.[5] But most of the carbon credits Rabobank sells to Microsoft are from its programme to plant trees on the lands of small coffee and cacao growers in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This programme, called Acorn, uses satellites and a Microsoft digital platform to measure the number and size of shade trees that small farmers plant on their farms and then calculate the carbon they‚Äôve removed from the atmosphere. It then sells the carbon to Microsoft as ‚Äúcarbon credits‚Äù for about US$38 a piece, taking a 20% cut for itself and its local partner, and paying farmers what‚Äôs left of the proceeds.[6] A big problem with Rabobank‚Äôs scheme, identified in an investigation of its project with cacao farmers in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, is that it is vastly overestimating the carbon removed ‚Äî in this case by 600%![7] What‚Äôs more, the C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire government says Rabobank is likely double dipping as its project overlaps with a World Bank-funded scheme that has already generated and sold carbon credits from trees planted on small cacao farms in the same area. All of this ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù, as Gates calls it, has not stopped an increasing number of corporations, governments and billionaires ‚Äî not to mention a new industry of climate consultants and carbon brokers ‚Äî from promoting the idea that emissions from fossil fuels can and should be offset by planting trees or other crops that sequester carbon. Such projects have a chequered history that goes back to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but they really only took off after the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, when governments endorsed the notion of offsets and carbon markets as an effective means to get corporations to cut their emissions.[8] Today, most offset projects are in the so-called ‚Äúvoluntary market‚Äù, where private companies from the global North manage the certification and sale of carbon credits to corporations that want to show they are taking action to deal with climate change. The projects, largely in the global South, can be for anything from the distribution of clean cook stoves in Malawi to the preservation of rainforests in Indonesia. The premise is that the project either prevents emissions that would have occurred without it, or that it leads to the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Cook stoves and rainforest preservation are examples of emissions avoidance. Planting trees, on the other hand, is the most popular form of removal. In a 2024 study, the World Rainforest Movement (WRM) says that the number of tree planting projects for carbon credits has tripled over the past three years.[9] WRM says the surge is partly driven by the large number of high-profile scandals in emissions avoidance schemes, known as ‚ÄúREDD+‚Äù.[10] Numerous projects to preserve forests have been withdrawn or suspended from carbon markets after investigations showed they were based on implausible stories about the threat of deforestation or that they caused human rights violations and other harms to local communities. As a result, WRM says corporations are turning their attention to tree planting as a source of ‚Äúhigh-integrity‚Äù carbon credits. This is now spawning a mad rush to secure lands where trees can be planted. Activists and scientists have been warning for years that schemes to offset carbon emissions by planting trees or other crops would lead to a surge in land grabbing, especially in the global South.[11] These warnings are now proving true. GRAIN combed through the various registries of carbon offset projects to try and get a better sense of this new land grab and how it is unfolding. We identified 279 large-scale tree and crop planting projects for carbon credits that corporations have initiated since 2016 in the global South. They cover over 9.1 million hectares of land ‚Äî an area roughly the size of Portugal. (See Box 1: What‚Äôs included and what‚Äôs not included in the land deal dataset) The deals (view the dataset here) add up to a massive new form of land grabbing that will only increase conflicts and pressures over land that are still simmering from the last global land grab spree that erupted in 2007-8 in the wake of global food and financial crises. They also signify that new sources of money are now flowing into the coffers of companies specialised in taking lands from communities in the South to enrich and serve corporations, mainly in the North. Box 1: What‚Äôs included and what‚Äôs not included in the land deal dataset What‚Äôs in? Our data covers projects from all the major voluntary offset project registries. These are: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard (GS), Verra (VCS), BioCarbono (BC), Cercarbono (CV) and Plan Vivo (PV). It also includes cases on the website farmlandgrab.org that are not yet found in the registries. The projects in our dataset are limited to projects that: ‚Äì involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 ha for the purpose of producing carbon credits; ‚Äì are driven by companies from outside the communities; ‚Äì were initiated since 2016 and up to 31 March 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and ‚Äì are located in the global South. The projects involve either 1) the creation of large-scale plantations or 2) contract production with small farmers. But all the projects bind the use of the land to the terms of the project for 20 years or more. What‚Äôs not in? REDD+ projects, which aim to avoid deforestation, are not included. Some types of projects that produce carbon credits through tree planting or agriculture on large areas of land are not included either. These are: ‚Äì projects to manage pasture lands, which affect the access to lands and traditional practices of pastoralists; ‚Äì projects to restore or create mangroves, where large areas of coastline are taken over for the planting of mangrove trees; and, ‚Äì projects which generate carbon credits by enrolling farmers to implement agricultural practices that are said to build up carbon in the soils, often called ‚Äúcarbon farming‚Äù. These projects are extremely important and can have equally severe impacts on communities, including land grabbing, but they are not covered here to keep the dataset manageable.[12] Our data also does not cover projects located in the global North, such as in New Zealand, Scotland and Australia, where national schemes that endorse tree planting for carbon offsets have led to a displacement in food production and undermined farmers‚Äô access to land.[13] To date, 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by these projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia, which are developing their own industries of carbon project developers. But projects in these countries account for less than a third of the total land area involved. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares.[14] Many of the projects involve land deals to set up giant eucalyptus, acacia or bamboo plantations. Typically, these are pasture lands or savannahs that were used until now by local communities for grazing livestock or growing food. . . The money that investors plan to capture from these deals is immense. The projects we pulled from the Verra and Gold Standard registries alone will generate 2.5 billion carbon credits (1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2 removed) over their lifetime. With an average price of about US$10 per credit, that adds up to a potential bounty of US$25 billion.[15] While these projects are exclusively set up in rural areas with extremely low emissions per capita, it is quite the opposite when it comes to the companies orchestrating the projects. With the exception of what‚Äôs happening in India and China, most carbon projects are led by foreign companies in rich countries with atrocious emissions records ‚Äî such as the Netherlands, the US, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, France, Germany and the UAE.[16] There is a clear colonial dynamic at work, with companies and big NGOs from the North once again using the lands of communities in the global South for their own agendas and their own benefit. . GRAIN and UChicago Data Science Institute (click here for better resolution) . A good number of actors driving this new wave of land grabs are in fact repeat offenders from the global farmland grab that took off a decade and a half ago. This is especially the case in Africa. (See Box 3: Africa‚Äôs land grabbers are back in business) There are also several companies from the forestry sector with histories of land grabbing and conflicts with local communities. Much of the vast eucalyptus plantations of Brazilian paper giant Suzano, for example, which is involved in three large-scale carbon plantation projects, have been grabbed from Brazil‚Äôs indigenous and traditional peoples.[17] And a non-negligible number of project developers have records of illegal dealings and financial scandal. They include: The money being hustled by these carbon cowboys comes mainly from the world‚Äôs most polluting corporations, who are interested in buying carbon credits to greenwash their emissions. At the top of the list of credit buyers are fossil fuel companies (See Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping). But there are also tech giants like Meta and Apple, food companies like Danone and Coca-Cola, and supermarket chains like Mercado Libre and Carrefour. Amazon and the philanthropic arms of its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, are heavily involved, too. Bezos both buys credits and funds the NGOs and companies running the plantations, through initiatives like the AFR100 fund, which aims to plant trees on 100 million hectares in Africa.[23] The same goes for development banks, like FMO of the Netherlands, the US International Development Finance Corporation or the World Bank‚Äôs International Finance Corporation, which provide cheap loans, political risk insurance and even equity investments to many carbon plantation companies. Box 2: Carbon colonialism On 15 April 2022, a group of about 150 farmers gathered outside the operations of Belgian supermarket Colruyt. Standing behind wheel barrows of soil, the farmers accused the company of ‚Äústealing lands‚Äù by buying up hundreds of hectares of the country‚Äôs scarce farmland, ironically as part of a campaign to buy local. ‚ÄúEach piece of land that Colruyt buys is a piece of land taken away from Belgian family farms,‚Äù they said.[24] Far away, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the supermarket chain is also acquiring land, but for decidedly not ‚Äúlocal‚Äù reasons. In 2021, Colruyt got a 25-year, 10,656 ha concession in Kwango province ‚Äî about 50 times the size of its Belgian farmlands. It plans to establish tree plantations to offset its emissions on these lands, which are currently used by local people for food crops, and to hire security guards to protect the trees from villagers and their ‚Äúslash and burn‚Äù agriculture.[25] In neighbouring Uganda, the Swedish hamburger chain Max is also buying credits from a carbon plantation project, but with a different approach. Rather than displacing local farmers, it gets them to plant trees on their own lands. Participating farmers sign a contract stating that they will plant and maintain trees, get seedlings and a little training, and submit to periodic checks. In return, they get payments for the carbon credits bought by Max to offset its hamburgers. But when a team of journalists from the Swedish media site Aftonbladet visited the farmers in early 2024 they found a horror show.[26] The farmers said they had planted the trees as they were told, not knowing that these trees were offsetting a corporation‚Äôs pollution. Things started off fine, but the trees are fast growing and quickly started taking over their fields, sucking up all the sunlight, nutrients and water. The US$100 a year in payments from carbon credits did not cover the loss of food and income from their crops. Eight years into the project, the Swedish media crew found farmers starving ‚Äî and some were chopping down the trees despite threats of prison for breach of contract by the project proponent. ‚ÄúI used to be something called a model farmer,‚Äù says Samuel Byarugaba, one of the farmers. ‚ÄúPeople came to me to learn about farming and I was proud to show our farm. We had enough food to feed ourselves and could sell the surplus. Now it‚Äôs all disappeared.‚Äù Corporations from the financial sector are also starting to get involved ‚Äî a worrying sign that much more money could be mobilised. Rabobank and BTG Pactual are leading examples of financial players establishing specialised funds to invest in carbon plantations on behalf of pension funds, billionaires, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, development banks and other institutional investors. Their investment in carbon plantations dovetails with the landholdings that many of these actors have already amassed through timber and farm land investments.[27] The Renewable Resources Group, for instance, is a US private equity firm whose investors include Goldman Sachs and the Harvard University endowment. It specialises in ‚Äúmonetising‚Äù water by buying up land in parts of the world where it can get access to cheap irrigation to produce high value crops for export, like grapes and berries. It has already acquired over 100,000 ha of agricultural lands in parts of Mexico, the US, Chile and Argentina where there are water scarcity issues.[28] Recently it established a ‚Äúnature-based solutions‚Äù division through which it acquired the German-based private equity fund 12Tree. Since 2017, 12Tree has acquired 20,000 ha in Latin America and Africa to establish ‚Äúregenerative‚Äù farms where it plants trees and generates carbon credits.[29] One big difference between earlier land grabs for food production and today‚Äôs land grab for carbon offsets is that the carbon deals are ‚Äúcertified‚Äù. Verra and Gold Standard, two of the top certifiers, are paid large sums of money to ensure that offset projects are done in consultation with local communities, avoid displacing them and even provide them with some benefits. It‚Äôs the kind of system that agencies like the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Bank have long claimed would solve the ills of the global farmland grab. Yet, our dataset and the growing number of investigations by academics, media and civil society into projects certified by these companies put the lie to such claims.[30] How could anyone expect that a market premised on acquiring lands from rural and indigenous communities in the global South, for the benefit of corporations in the global North, could amount to anything other than a massive land grab? No benefit-sharing mechanism, often baked into these carbon deals, alters that outcome. Box 3: Africa‚Äôs land grabbers are back in business The rush for land that followed the food and financial crises of 2007-8 hit Africa hard. Hundreds of communities were displaced from their lands to make way for large-scale industrial farms. Yet, even though many of these farms failed badly, the communities are still struggling to get back their lands.[31] Some culprits in that land rush (and near cousins) are now trying to get lands for carbon plantations. Below are some examples. Gagan Gupta: As President of agribusiness giant Olam International, this Singaporean businessman oversaw the company‚Äôs 300,000 ha land deal in Gabon in 2011 to build Africa‚Äôs largest oil palm plantation. The operation has been mired in conflicts with communities ever since. Now Gupta is running a UAE-based tree plantation company, Sequoia Plantation, which is in the process of securing 200,000 ha in Togo, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo for large-scale tree plantations with carbon offset components, despite protests from affected communities.[32] Kevin Godlington: This UK businessman orchestrated several failed large-scale land deals in Sierra Leone. One was an oil palm plantation in the District of Port Loko that cleared forest and displaced people from their lands before it went bankrupt. Undeterred, Godlington is now going after the same lands with a new venture listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that claims to have lease rights to 57,000 ha to plant trees for carbon credits, some of which have already been bought by British Petroleum. As with the first round of land deals, no matter how things pan out, Godlington has already pocketed millions of dollars from the scheme.[33] Carter Coleman: This UK businessman built the infamous Kilombero Plantation Limited rice farm on 5,818 ha of contested community lands in the heart of Tanzania‚Äôs Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor. Despite heavy backing from foreign development banks and investors, it went bankrupt in 2019. Coleman is now back with a new company called Udzungwa Corridor Limited that will generate carbon credits by planting ‚Äúrare tropical hardwoods‚Äù on a 7,500 ha stretch of land leased from local farmers along the Kilombero Nature Reserve.[34] Andrea Tozzi: This Italian businessman, CEO of his family‚Äôs company Tozzi Green, acquired 11,000 ha of land in three communes in the Ihorombe region of Madagascar in 2012 and 2018 to grow the biofuel crop jatropha. That project failed, and the company switched to growing maize for animal feed and essential oil crops. All the while the communities have been fighting to get their lands back, which they say they need to graze their cattle and grow food for their families. Tozzi is now trying to save his project by replacing the maize with plantations of acacia and eucalyptus for carbon credits ‚Äî which communities, especially those in Ambatolahy, are still firmly resisting. [35] Karl Kirchmayer: This Austrian businessman, who spent years buying up 147,000 ha of farmlands in Eastern Europe, now has an African land grab venture, ASC Impact. It is partnering with a Senior Advisor to the President of Uganda and a Dubai businessman close to the royal family to sell 60 million tons of carbon credits to UAE companies from mangrove and tree plantation projects, mainly in Africa. ASC Impact is currently negotiating for 27,000 ha in Ethiopia, 25,000 in Angola and 270,000 in the Republic of the Congo! Frank Timis: This Romanian-Swiss businessman is the founder and majority shareholder of African Agriculture Holdings Inc, a US company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, that took over 25,000 ha of lands from a failed Italian company that local communities in Senegal have been fighting to get back for over a decade. His company is also responsible for the largest land deal in our database ‚Äî a ridiculous pair of 49-year leases covering 2.2 million ha in Niger, where the company will produce carbon credits by planting pine trees. And while nine million hectares is already too much, things could get much worse. The UN climate negotiations are moving towards establishing an international carbon trading mechanism that would allow heavy polluting country governments and their companies to offset national emissions through deals for carbon projects in other countries, mainly in the global South.[36] If and when this happens, the value of carbon credits could surge, generating even higher demand for land to plant trees. Pressure is also coming from efforts to establish markets for biodiversity offsets, which will trigger a feeding frenzy among investors eager to make a buck from the territories of small farmers, indigenous peoples and pastoralists.[37] The idea that planting trees or other means of generating carbon credits can compensate for fossil fuels emissions is a dangerous distraction, incompatible with the real cuts to emissions that are required to deal with the climate crisis.[38] Consider, for instance, that even if the dubious emission removal estimates of the 279 projects in our dataset were true, they would only amount to 55 million tonnes of CO2 per year‚Äì not nearly enough to even cover last year‚Äôs 90 million tonne increase in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.[39] Social movements and organisations need to be relentless in exposing these contradictions, harms and frauds. We also need to get more information to the communities on the ground. They are often confused by what the project proponents tell them and not exposed about what other communities have experienced. They are almost never informed about how the projects are designed to enable big corporations to keep polluting and how this pollution is connected to the terrible impacts they are suffering from climate change. The hype about the money to be made, under the misnomer of benefit sharing, can create divisions within communities and draw some families into signing contracts they may soon regret. As all these carbon projects are premised on formal land ownership, they can also undermine community systems of land management. There are already cases where communities have faced violence and intimidation for resisting carbon offset projects and this is only going to escalate. It is therefore becoming increasingly urgent to share information and experiences about the carbon grabs ‚Äì locally, nationally, regionally and internationally ‚Äî so we can put a stop to them. The double threat to communities ‚Äì both from climate change itself and from these criminal solutions to it ‚Äî should not be allowed to play out. Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping In September 2023, the oil company Shell shocked carbon markets when it abruptly cancelled plans to plant trees on 12 million hectares of land by 2030 ‚Äì an area three times the size of its home country, the Netherlands.[40] There wasn‚Äôt much to celebrate, however, as the company also scrapped plans to reduce oil production.[41]It‚Äôs not clear if Shell was backing out entirely from the carbon offset industry, either. Shell still owns a controlling stake in a Dutch biodiesel company seeking to generate carbon credits by planting pongamia on 120,000 ha in Paraguay. Shell‚Äôs European cohorts have not yet lost their enthusiasm for carbon plantations. Italy‚Äôs Eni has a biofuel venture pursuing carbon credits in Kenya contracting farmers to grow croton plants on an initial 40,000 ha. British Petroleum (BP) paid Canada‚Äôs Carbon Done Right US$2.5 million earlier this year for carbon credits from a 57,000 ha tree plantation project the company is pursuing in Sierra Leone. And the French oil company TotalEnergies has a massive 38,000 ha acacia plantation project to offset its emissions in the Republic of the Congo. Investigations into all three projects point to severe impacts on local farmers.[42] Two of Japan‚Äôs top energy firms are also deep into carbon offset plantations. Marubeni has a 31,000 ha pine and eucalyptus plantation project in Angola with an Argentinian businessman.[43] Mitsui, through its Australian subsidiary New Forests, is erecting tree plantations for carbon credits on leased farmlands in northern Tasmania and, through its African Forestry Impact Platform, it recently acquired Green Resources AS, ‚Äúa Norwegian plantation forestry and carbon credit company notorious for its history of land grabbing, human rights violations, and environmental destruction across Uganda, Mozambique, and Tanzania‚Äù.[44] * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Dell says sales team must work on-site 5 days a week to drive productivity
URL: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/dell-says-sales-team-must-work-on-site-5-days-a-week-to-drive-productivity/

Most members of Dell‚Äôs sales team will no longer have the option to work remotely, starting on Monday, Reuters reported this week, citing an internal memo. The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping ‚Äúgrow skills,‚Äù per the note. Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have posted online (The Register reported that the post ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren‚Äôt required to go into an office but ‚Äúshould prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.‚Äù The policy doesn‚Äôt apply to ‚Äúremote sales team members,‚Äù but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers ‚Äúin the coming weeks.‚Äù Bloomberg reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell‚Äôs president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying: ‚Ä¶ our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite. Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team‚Äôs culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like ‚Äúreal-time feedback‚Äù and ‚Äúdynamic" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said. Notably, the letter, which was reportedly sent to workers on Thursday, doesn‚Äôt give employees much time for adjustments. The memo acknowledges that workers have built schedules around working from home regularly but doesn‚Äôt offer immediate solutions. In a statement to The Register, a Dell spokesperson confirmed the policy change. ‚ÄúWe continually evolve our business so we‚Äôre set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners," they said. "That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership." After permitting full-time remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in February, Dell started requiring workers to go into the office 39 days per quarter (or about three days per week) or be totally remote. The latter, however, seemed discouraged, as Dell reportedly told remote workers they were ineligible for promotions in March. Still, nearly 50 percent of Dell workers chose to stay remote, Business Insider reported in June, citing internal Dell Data. Dell‚Äôs return-to-office (RTO) mandates have reportedly been enforced with VPN and badge tracking. Some employees have accused Dell of trying to reduce headcount with RTO policies. Other companies pushing workers back into offices have also been accused of this; there‚Äôs research showing that at least some companies have used RTO policies to lower headcount while avoiding layoffs. Dell laid off 13,000 people in 2023 and plans more layoffs. In August, it announced plans to lay off an undisclosed additional number of people. The company is expected to have 120,000 employees. Dell‚Äôs RTO change follows an announcement this week requiring Amazon employees to work on-site five days a week starting next year. Following the announcement, a survey of 2,585 US Amazon employees found that 73 percent of Amazon workers are ‚Äúconsidering looking for an another job‚Äù in response. The memo, according to Reddit, acknowledges to workers, ‚ÄúYes, this is a shift from current expectations.‚Äù Dell‚Äôs RTO push represents an about-face from previously stated positions on remote work from the company. In 2022, for example, CEO and founder Michael Dell wrote a blog that said Dell ‚Äúfound no meaningful differences‚Äù between remote and on-site workers, including before the pandemic. Dell COO Jeff Clarke made similar arguments in 2020. The idea that remote work hinders productivity has been a hot topic of debate, especially as companies grapple with their remote work policies following pandemic restrictions. Dell says that its decision to force sales workers back into offices is backed by data, and its claims of boosted productivity could potentially be true when it comes to this specific Dell division. However, there have also been studies suggesting that return-to-office mandates hurt productivity. For example, a Great Place to Work survey conducted in July 2023 of 4,400 employees concluded that ‚Äúproductivity was lower for both on-site and remote employees when their employer mandated where they work.‚Äù Workers with companies allowing employees to choose between remote and on-site work were more likely to give ‚Äúextra effort," the survey found.

Title: Hedge Funds Think NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Is The Best Most Active Stock To Buy Now

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks. The economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants. As stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: ‚ÄúChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC‚Äôs Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%. He referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses. Further discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...‚Äù However, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts. In a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial. Kantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary. He noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support. Looking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability. Kantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy. Methodology We sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Volume: 120.458 million Average Volume (3-Month): 327.422 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning. In FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance. At its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities. The company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: ‚ÄúNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA‚Äôs products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock‚Äôs appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia‚Äôs products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today‚Äôs accelerated computing infrastructure.‚Äù Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

WeightWatchers (WW) International said Friday that CEO Sima Sistani is stepping down immediately. She will be replaced by Tara Comonte, a board member and the former CEO of Shake Shack (SHAK), who was appointed as interim chief executive effective immediately. Sistani leaves the parent company of the once popular points-based weight loss program as it faces challenges in adapting to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Board, I want to sincerely thank Sima for her leadership in advancing our strategy, for adding WeightWatchers Clinic to our offerings and for her unwavering commitment to our mission,‚Äù Thilo Semmelbauer, chairman of the WeightWatchers board of directors, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe wish her all the best in her future endeavors.‚Äù Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatcher acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering its members the highly-coveted weight loss drugs. But the bet hasn‚Äôt seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers stock is down more than 90% since the beginning of the year. In August, Sistani revealed that the struggling company would cut $100 million in costs over the next year by streamlining its operations and reducing its workforce, including a 40% cut in positions at the vice president level and above. The news comes at a time when a class of weight loss dugs known GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 39% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 68%. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who has acknowledged taking weight loss drugs, left her spot on the WeightWatchers board earlier this year. She had been a member of the board since 2015. At the time, Winfrey said she was donating all her WeightWatchers shares to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. WeightWatchers said it supported Winfrey‚Äôs decision, which it added would ‚Äúeliminate any perceived conflict of interest around her taking weight loss medications.‚Äù Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The S&P 500 on Thursday marked its 42nd record high close in 2024, while the Dow marked its 32nd record high close of the year on Friday. All three major indexes notched a positive week. The Dow gained 0.6%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, showed that the prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 2.2% last month on an annual basis, down from 2.5% in July. The reading was below expectations from economists polled by FactSet, and is a step closer towards the Fed‚Äôs 2% inflation target. Related article A dual win for consumers: Inflation cooled last month, paving way for borrowing costs to come down more Fresh data this week has offered further encouragement that the economy is on solid footing. The third estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a solid 3% clip from the prior year. ‚ÄúWhat seems to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft landing scenario that only the most optimistic could dream of,‚Äù wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY, in a Thursday note. A soft landing is a scenario in which inflation comes down without the economy entering a recession. Elsewhere, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since September 2022 this week, according to Freddie Mac data, providing relief for Americans stung by the tough housing market. Applications to refinance a mortgage soared 20% last week from the prior week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. The housing market is known for being sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the economy. Investors are now looking to the September labor report due next Friday. Employers added an estimated 142,000 jobs last month, up from July‚Äôs dismal number, while the unemployment rate ticked lower, to 4.2%, offering hope that the labor market is weakening but still on solid footing. With the Fed‚Äôs focus now squarely on keeping the labor market healthy, Friday‚Äôs report will likely offer clues for the Fed‚Äôs next move at its November policy meeting.

Nvidia shares jumped 4.6%, Tesla shares rose 9.3% and Meta Platforms shares added 1.1%. In China, stocks ripped higher this week after the central bank introduced a package of measures aimed at stimulating its struggling economy, including lowering interest rates. Oil prices fell for the week. The national average price of gas is about $3.21, according to GasBuddy. The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources, that Saudi Arabia is planning to scrap its $100 a barrel price target for oil. Gold futures retreated from a fresh record high reached Thursday, the latest in a string of records it has set this year. Gold has notched repeated record highs this year, driven by central bank buying of the yellow metal and worries about the US economy‚Äôs health. Bitcoin popped this week. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading at about $65,747 a coin. As stocks settle after the trading session, levels might change slightly.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year

While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose approximately 151%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

Title: Why Nvidia stock could soar over 500% by the end of the decade, former consulting exec says

Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:21:47Z

Nvidia is headed for a meteoric run-up by the end of the decade, according to one former consulting exec. Phil Panaro ‚Äî a former senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group who also served as CEO of a BCG subsidiary ‚Äî says shares of the AI chipmaker will reach $800 by 2030. That implies another 545% upside for the stock, which traded around $122 a share mid-day Friday. The Jensen Huang-led firm will benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, as well as migration from Web2 to Web3, Panaro predicted, referring to the idea that the internet's next era will be denominated by blockchain technology. Those developments could result in big spending from Nvidia's customers, he said, pointing to estimates from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley that Web3 could fuel trillions of added value in the market. "Nvidia powers all of the accelerated computing, to make that happen, so they're going to have a major share of that," Panaro said in an interview with Schwab Network on Thursday. He later estimated that the firm's revenue could scale by a factor of 10, from $60 billion in the last fiscal year to $600 billion by 2030. Investors may not have to wait long to see some of those gains. Panaro foresees a "huge explosion" in the stock after Nvidia releases Blackwell, its next-gen AI chip, though he didn't specify his short-term price target. "Not to sound overconfident ‚Äî it's actually inevitable provided that they can continue to make these chips," he later added of the firm's upside potential. "The AI penetration in the economy right now is literally less than 1%. So you still have all the corporates, the cities, the municipalities, the governments, the military, that are going to be spending money to make sure they leverage AI effectively. So tons of money still to be spent." Some strategists have been skeptical over Nvidia's rally, with the stock up a monster 2,733% over the last five years. Analysts have attributed some of that growth to "hyperscalers," a small group of Big Tech firms buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities. But despite concerns those customers could eventually pull away, the small group of buyers is actually a good sign Nvidia's business will scale, Panaro said. "That's actually the best case for why it's actually going to go up. Because if you look at all the other customers they're not getting to, there's 490 other Fortune 500 firms that haven't really adopted AI to the fullest because they don't understand it. You have all these cities and governments that are going to be redoing all their infrastructure from Web2 to Web3, and you then have the AI arms race, with countries and their militaries, which Nvidia hasn't penetrated for the most part," Panaro said. He continued: "The stock can go to the moon, essentially, provided that they deliver." Panaro's prediction leans on the extreme end of forecasters, but Wall Street is generally feeling bullish about the chipmaker's stock, which has climbed 152% since the start of the year. Analysts have issued an average price target of $152 a share for the stock, according to Nasdaq data, implying around 25% upside from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:‚ÄúThe saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.‚Äù The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying ‚Äúmental models.‚Äù A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build ‚Äúwealth‚Äú‚Äîby investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and ‚Äúknowledge.‚Äù Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the ‚Äúmental model‚Äù approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach‚Äîthese include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the ‚Äúwho you hang out with,‚Äù I have a simple piece of advice:‚ÄúIf you want to fly like an eagle don‚Äôt hang out with turkeys.‚Äù I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled ‚ÄúPoor Charlie‚Äôs Almanac‚Äù that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women‚Äôs empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives. Here are 3 of her mental models and frameworks. The most powerful mental model here for me is the framework of ‚Äútaking charge‚Äù and owning your future rather than one of victimhood. That is expanded on in her best selling book ‚ÄúLean In.‚Äù Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion that is now the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. Invest as early as possible and let compounding make you rich over time. $10,000 invested in the USA sharemarket when you were 30 becomes $237,000 when you‚Äôre 60. Going deeper In a recent AFR publication there was a chart that revealed the power of compounding returns using an example of investing in stock markets. It compared the different stock markets total return if you invested $10,000 30 years ago. It displays the power of compounding and how a small change in return can produce a much bigger result from the power of compounding. This powerful visual comparison shows that $30,000 invested in the Australian Stock market 30 years ago vs the same $30,000 invested in the USA stock over the same period. Result Total value of $10,000 over 30 years with all dividends reinvested and no withdrawals. To put that in perspective a relatively small investment of $10,000 in the USA markets when you were 30 became $237,318 at the age of 60 but only worth $135,165 in Australia. That is a $100,000+ difference The other revelation was what a difference it made when there was only a 2% difference. Australia had a 9.1% return and the USA was 11.1%. Ray Dalio is a financial success as the founder of Bridgewater which is one of the worlds largest hedge funds. And his biggest mental model is ‚Äúradical transparency‚Äù within his organization. It is a model that works for him and his business. It may not work for you. But it may. A good mental model will be what makes sense to you and your experience in life. It will be the intersection of your skills, life journey and curiosity. You need to own it. Make it yours. Sometimes I find road testing different ideas is a good first step. Here are some of Ray‚Äôs mental models to reflect on. Feedback loops make a lot of sense to me.They can be seen as using information and data to find what works and what doesn‚Äôt as quickly as possible. It can be very data driven and objective or more nuanced and subjective. Jeff saw a vision of an online bookstore in 1995. 30 years later he has grown Amazon into a trillion dollar company and with a personal wealth of $211 billion dollars is the second wealthiest person in the world. He plays the long game and one of his prioritized models is long-term thinking. The regret minimization model is something worth looking deeper at. This starts to become more obvious and apparent when you‚Äôre older. And many of us live with regret.It is a great question to keep asking yourself. Maybe try putting yourself a bit further into the future and take the time to reflect on your current situation and ask better questions. Charlie Munger was Warren Buffets sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. The reality was that he was much more than that and it was a synergistic partnership that lasted 58 years. But they both had their own mental models and agreed on others. Charlie died in 2023 and had used 90 plus mental models to help him make wise decisions. The inversion mental model is counterintuitive as it makes you look at the consequences of the opposite of what you want to achieve. Instead of focusing on what would make a project successful, you think about what could cause it to fail, and then work to avoid those pitfalls. Example: Suppose you want to improve customer satisfaction in your business. Instead of asking, ‚ÄúWhat can we do to make our customers happier?‚Äù, you ask, ‚ÄúWhat are we doing that could be making our customers unhappy?‚Äù then take specific actions to eliminate these issues, thereby indirectly improving overall customer satisfaction. I don‚Äôt need to introduce Steve Jobs except to say that his birthday on February 24 was on the same date of the year as mine. So we are both Pisces. Let‚Äôs leave the comparison there. Finding or creating ‚ÄúSimplicity‚Äù in the middle of all the noise and complexity takes time and effort. So‚Ä¶simplicity takes hard work. Winston Churchill said it well. ‚ÄúI would have written you a shorter letter but I didn‚Äôt have the time.‚Äù To go back to comparisons between Steve and me. I love finding the simplicity in complexity. Let me say: Less is more. The founder of Facebook (now known as Meta) has maybe created the most information in the world by getting people to sign up to his social media platform and making it easy for the world to share their information without creating any of his own. That is ‚Äúscaling economics‚Äù at its smartest. Key takeaway As competitors entered the market Mark quickly realized that he didn‚Äôt have to innovate all the time but buy or copy. Instagram and WhatsApp threatened to steal traffic, users and attention from Facebook so he bought them. And to show the middle finger to Elon Musk at Twitter (Now known as X) he copied Twitter and started ‚ÄúThreads‚Äù. In just a few months Threads had acquired 100 million users. Innovator‚Äôs dilemma solved. Elon is currently the world‚Äôs richest person. And Tesla and SpaceX are his biggest contributors to that wealth. And he didn‚Äôt get there without some clever thinking and using some powerful mental models that helped him. Long-term vision is one of his superpowers and one of his mental models. Going to colonize Mars is as long term as it gets! It‚Äôs not in my vision as I quite like the beach and I have heard that there are no beaches and sand there. But what is interesting is that this mental model is also one of the key mental models of Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. No more needs to be said. Bill along with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet spends a lot of time reading. I am not talking about superficial reading (also known as doom scrolling) on Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. As the founder of Microsoft that he started in the 1980‚Äôs (that is now worth $3.22 trillion) he has certainly earned the right to give himself the permission to read, and gain knowledge. ‚ÄúCompounding‚Äù is not just something reserved for financial wealth. It also applies to knowledge wealth. Taking a long term approach to gaining knowledge and hopefully wisdom is one of Bill Gates approaches and frameworks for life. Take the time to keep feeding your mind with deep knowledge and the compound effect of that will surprise you. Richard Branson had trouble reading as he was dyslexic. But that didn‚Äôt stop him succeeding as he had the ability to choose the right people to hire and partner with. I surround myself with people that do the things I hate and I am bad at. That includes cleaners, accountants and tax advisers. So realizing that you are not good at something and choosing people to help you is leaning into the mental model of ‚ÄúPeople over process‚Äù Many of these models can be adapted to our big decisions in our personal life. They can also be applied to business and investing. The challenge is that there are many mental models and that alone will produce complexity and anxiety. Your next task is to create a mental model list and distill them into which ones are relevant for you and make a shorter list. And then start applying them and testing them. Ideas without action are just noise. Share this post: ¬© Jeff Bullas. Privacy Policy

Title: Wall Street SWOT: NVIDIA stock rides AI wave amid tech sector challenges
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/wall-street-swot-nvidia-stock-rides-ai-wave-amid-tech-sector-challenges-93CH-3636297
Time Published: 2024-09-27T14:02:27Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, leveraging its strong position in graphics processing units (GPUs) to capitalize on the growing demand for AI infrastructure. As the company prepares to report its July quarter earnings, analysts remain bullish on NVIDIA's prospects, despite concerns about product delays and increasing competition in the AI chip space. NVIDIA's data center segment has been the primary driver of the company's recent growth, with revenues expanding significantly year-over-year. The strong demand for NVIDIA's Hopper GPU computing platform, coupled with growth in InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, has propelled the company's financial performance. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with some projecting NVIDIA's earnings per share (EPS) to exceed $10 by 2030. The company's full-stack ecosystem positions it to capture 70-80% of the value in the parallel processing era, according to some analysts. This dominance is supported by NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and deepening system software capabilities, which are seen as key differentiators in sustaining its growth trajectory. NVIDIA's product roadmap includes the ramp-up of its next-generation GPU architecture, Blackwell, which is expected to contribute significantly to revenue in the coming quarters. Despite reports of a slight delay in Blackwell's production, analysts remain confident in NVIDIA's ability to meet demand through increased shipments of its current Hopper architecture. The company is also focusing on expanding its presence in enterprise and edge computing markets. NVIDIA's AI Foundry and NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) offerings aim to simplify AI rollouts for enterprises, potentially opening up new revenue streams as businesses increasingly adopt AI technologies. While NVIDIA maintains a dominant position in the AI chip market, competition is intensifying. Traditional semiconductor companies like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are ramping up their efforts in the AI space, while major tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are developing custom silicon solutions for their AI needs. Despite these competitive pressures, analysts believe NVIDIA's technological lead and ecosystem advantages will allow it to maintain its market leadership in the near term. The company's ability to introduce new SKUs and adapt to changing market demands, such as developing the H20 product to meet export control requirements for the Chinese market, demonstrates its agility in responding to challenges. NVIDIA's financial projections paint a picture of robust growth. Analysts estimate the company's revenue to grow from $60.92 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $203.42 billion by fiscal year 2027. Similarly, EPS is expected to increase from $1.15 to $4.85 over the same period. The company's strong balance sheet, with improving financial ratios such as net debt/EBITDA moving into negative territory, provides NVIDIA with flexibility to invest in research and development and pursue strategic initiatives. Recent reports of delays in NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have raised concerns about potential impacts on the company's competitive edge. While analysts generally view these delays as short-term issues, they could provide an opening for competitors to gain ground in the rapidly evolving AI chip market. If NVIDIA fails to execute its product roadmap effectively, it may face challenges in maintaining its dominant market share and meeting the growing demand for AI computing power. NVIDIA's global operations, particularly its reliance on manufacturing partners in Asia, expose it to geopolitical risks and potential export controls. The company has already faced challenges in selling certain high-performance chips to China due to U.S. government restrictions. While NVIDIA has developed products like the H20 to comply with these regulations, further tightening of export controls could significantly impact its ability to serve key markets. This geopolitical uncertainty adds a layer of risk to NVIDIA's growth prospects and could affect investor confidence in the long term. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and extensive ecosystem of developers and applications create a significant moat around its business. This ecosystem advantage makes it challenging for competitors to replicate NVIDIA's full-stack offerings, potentially locking in customers and developers for the long term. As AI applications become more prevalent across industries, NVIDIA's established ecosystem could drive sustained growth and market leadership, even in the face of increasing competition. While NVIDIA is best known for its GPUs in gaming and data centers, the company is actively expanding into new markets such as automotive, healthcare, and robotics. These diversification efforts could provide additional growth vectors and reduce NVIDIA's reliance on any single market segment. If successful, this strategy could help NVIDIA maintain its growth trajectory even if its core markets face temporary headwinds or increased competition. The company's efforts in areas like autonomous driving and AI-powered medical imaging could open up substantial new revenue streams in the coming years. NVIDIA Corporation continues to navigate the complex landscape of the AI and semiconductor industries, balancing strong growth prospects with emerging challenges. As the company moves forward, its ability to maintain technological leadership, expand into new markets, and manage geopolitical risks will be crucial in determining its long-term success. Investors and analysts will be closely watching NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and guidance for further insights into its trajectory in the rapidly evolving AI market.

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is due this morning; U.S. stock futures are steady after Thursday's jump and the S&P 500's record close; Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly revenue numbers; almost 1.2 million electricity customers are without power in Florida as Helene slams the state as a Category 4 hurricane; and Intel (INTC) reportedly rebuffs a bid by Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division. Here's what investors need to know today. Market watchers will be focused on the Fed's preferred inflation measure to gauge the future path of interest rates, after last week's half-percentage-point cut signaled the central bank's view that price pressures are easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is expected to have risen 2.3% year-over-year in August, down from 2.5% in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, but the "core" number is expected to have risen to 2.7% from 2.6%. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes surged Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high after a strong earnings report from Micron (MU) sent chip stocks sharply higher and shares of companies with exposure to the Chinese economy jumped on reports of additional government stimulus. The Nasdaq finished higher for a fourth straight session yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched closer to another record high of its own. Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping 1% in premarket trading after the warehouse retailer's quarterly revenue missed analysts' expectations as growth slowed. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales growth was just 1% year-over-year, offsetting earnings that topped forecasts. Investors will be watching how higher membership fees could affect the company‚Äôs results going forward. Hurricane Helene landed in Florida as a Category 4 storm Thursday night with wind speeds of around 140 miles per hour, with about 1.2 million customers losing power in the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland over Georgia, but a "life-threatening storm surge, winds, and heavy rains continue," the National Hurricane Center said. Troubled chipmaker Intel (INTC) has rejected a bid by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division, Bloomberg reported late Thursday. Earlier this week, the news outlet reported that Apollo Global Management had offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, days after The Wall Street Journal said that Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a "takeover approach" for it. Intel shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down more than 50% this year. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Arm are edging lower.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 ‚Äì GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 ‚Äì Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s ‚Äì Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

Title: The Hollywood Cuts Keep Comin‚Äô As Disney Does Another Worker Cleanse
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2024/09/27/the-hollywood-cuts-keep-comin-as-disney-does-another-worker-cleanse/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T10:11:14Z
Full Content:
(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) As if Hollywood needed any more reminders why the mantra ‚ÄúStay Alive Until 2025‚Äù is going to be difficult for many industry workers, Disney embarked this week on another 300 layoffs, on top of thousands of other reductions there and across the industry. This set of layoffs in the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney largely hit corporate workers in divisions such as legal, human resources, finance and communications, Deadline reported. All told, CEO Bob Iger has targeted 8,000 jobs for elimination. Some 4,000 of those cuts landed in April of last year, but more keep coming. In May, Disney‚Äôs Pixar laid off 175 workers amid a sustained box-office slump for the animation unit‚Äôs films. Even the subsequent record-setting performance of Inside Out 2 this summer wasn‚Äôt enough to fend off the Mouse House reaper. The Disney reductions, part of at least $7.5 billion in spending cuts that CEO Bob Iger instituted beginning late last year, haven‚Äôt spared sports either, even though that sector has been the most watched and lucrative remaining corner of broadcast and cable. This week, for instance, Disney‚Äôs ESPN division continued to lay off on-air talent, this time with NBA reporter and podcast star Zach Lowe. His departure follows recent exits by Robert Griffin III and Sam Ponder, who both, like Lowe, made more than $1 million a year. Five behind-the-camera executives, including Head of Content Operations Stephanie Druley, also have departed as part of a reorganization that Burke Magnus, ESPN‚Äôs President, Programming and Original Content, told staff in a recent memo will make the company ‚Äúmore strategic, collaborative and nimble‚Äù while resulting in ‚Äúnew positions or promotions for people who are expanding their responsibilities or taking on new challenges.‚Äù Basically, the survivors will get to do more with less. The cuts come amid the unexpected retirement of NBA scoop-meister Adrian Wojnarowski, who earlier this month walked away from an estimated $20 million remaining in his ESPN contract to become general manager of the men‚Äôs basketball team at his alma mater, tiny St. Bonaventure‚Äôs University in upstate New York. Disney is, of course, far from the only Hollywood media giant getting buffeted by the industry‚Äôs many changes. Paramount Global is headed toward a sale to a group led by Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely won‚Äôt close until well into 2025. Nonetheless, Paramount‚Äôs three-headed Office of the CEO is proceeding with 15% cuts across its operations, which are far smaller (and less profitable) than Disney‚Äôs. The latest cuts wiped out entire offices, such as the communications unit for Paramount+, the company‚Äôs main streaming service. All gone, Deadline reported Friday. Similarly, the streaming service‚Äôs eight-person content strategy team was wiped out, perhaps further indication that the strategy for Paramount+ is to stop operating on a stand-alone basis after the merger finally closes. Given the debt crunch Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone were facing, deep cuts were inevitable, especially given the many overlapping operations with Skydance in film, TV and animation production. But it‚Äôs all of a piece with larger layoff waves washing over the industry. Debt-saddled Warner Bros. Discovery has undergone seemingly endless cuts, layoffs and closures since it was created 2.5 years ago from a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia (and still more cuts during AT&T‚Äôs spotty previous stewardship). Even Comcast may be vulnerable, especially as the price of NBCUniversal‚Äôs new $2.5-billion-per-year NBA rights deal starts to bite next year, even though its parts include the eponymous cable provider, a burgeoning wireless carrier, and theme parks. It‚Äôs useful to view the imminent (and entirely self-driven) retirement of beloved Today Show Hoda Kotb this week, with her $20-million-a-year contract, as just one example of what‚Äôll be happening with NBC News salaries for on-air personalities as contracts come up for negotiation. More big names are likely to move on, or eat a pay cut or minimal pay hike in the new era. Disney told the New York Times in a statement that it is looking to manage resources and costs ‚Äúmore effectively‚Äù to ‚Äúfuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney.‚Äù Hollywood‚Äôs biggest media company is hardly alone in that search. The streaming wars proved ruinously expensive ‚Äî even for relative winners such as Disney+ and Hulu, which Disney now fully controls. Losses just from subscription streaming-video operations have topped $11 billion across the industry, according to SEC filings by the various contenders. That total doesn‚Äôt include any losses at Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video, their programming and operating costs subsumed within (and unreported by) the vast mass of their far more lucrative main businesses, though even they are reportedly tightening program spending and operational costs. The mediacos are feeling Wall Street pressure to turn streaming services into profitable operations, a process made more complicated by the accelerating swoon in customers watching the companies‚Äô legacy cable and broadcast operations. Cord-cutting has nearly halved the cable subscription footprint to a little more than 50 million U.S. households. All the streaming operations, even those owned by Netflix and tech giants Apple and Amazon, have been cutting or re-prioritizing their spending on entertainment properties. Even industry leader Netflix is spending differently, even as it continues to generate billions in cash flow. The company has spent around $17 billion a year on programming the past few years, executives have repeatedly said in earnings calls. Now it‚Äôs reportedly reconsidering the cost-plus approach to its talent deals, going back to a modified version of a flat fee with an actual back-end for successful projects (only). But now Netflix is spending more on live events, like The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which proved to be one of the company‚Äôs most-watched shows of 2024‚Äôs first half, according to Netflix‚Äôs recent release of viewership statistics. Netflix also recently announced a deal to carry two NFL games this Christmas Day. That‚Äôll likely be huge for Netflix viewership, but also means the reported $150 million paid for the two games‚Äô rights won‚Äôt be spent on, say, five run-of-the-mill rom-coms or a couple of mid-level action comedies. For that matter, Netflix has also been profitably licensing more and more old shows from its erstwhile competitors, who after a few years of streaming wars freezeouts, once again are welcoming the found money of a Netflix deal for a library show such as Suits. While that‚Äôs good money for the owners and creators of those older shows, that‚Äôs also money that won‚Äôt be spent making new shows, either at Netflix or at the production studios. All of that has also translated to deep problems at Los Angeles production, post-production, visual-effects and other corners of the industry that regularly do projects with the studios.

Title: Dell mandates in-office work for global sales team after laying off over 12,000 employees: Report

Dell Technologies has announced a significant shift in its work policy for global sales team employees. According to an internal memo obtained by sources, starting September 30, staff members who can work from company offices will be required to do so five days a week, as per a report by Bloomberg. The tech giant's decision aims to foster a more collaborative environment and enhance skill development among its sales force. The memo emphasised the importance of in-person work, stating, ‚ÄúWorking remotely should be the exception rather than the routine,‚Äù as quoted by Bloomberg. Field representatives are expected to divide their time between customer and partner interactions and office presence, totalling five days a week. This marks an increase from the previous three-day in-office requirement, per the report. However, the company has made provisions for certain employees, noting, ‚ÄúRemote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely,‚Äù Bloomberg reported. Dell has promised to provide additional information regarding remote workers shortly. In August, Dell announced a significant restructuring of its sales division, including layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and prioritise artificial intelligence. According to an internal memo sent to staff on August 6, the company said it plans to consolidate its sales teams and establish a new unit focused on AI, Business Insider reported. While Dell has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected, estimates suggest that around 12,500 workers, representing roughly 10% of the company's total workforce, may be impacted, according to a report from Newsbyte. Dell's move comes amid a broader trend of tech companies reevaluating their remote work policies established during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many firms have embraced hybrid models, some are pushing for a more substantial office presence. In a similar vein, e-commerce giant Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from company offices five days a week starting next year, a stricter policy compared to their previous three-day mandate. Dell has recently faced challenges in its core personal computer business, which has not rebounded as strongly as expected following a prolonged downturn. The tech giant's latest financial report, released on August 30, revealed a decline in revenue for its fiscal second quarter. The company posted $12.4 billion in revenue, representing a 4% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year and falling slightly short of market projections. The report highlighted a stark contrast between Dell's PC business segments. While sales of business-oriented computers remained relatively stable, the consumer PC division experienced a significant downturn, with revenue plummeting by 22 per cent year-on-year. In response to these financial headwinds, Dell signalled its intention to implement strategic cost-cutting measures in a regulatory filing submitted on September 11. ‚ÄúWe remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs."

Title: Netflix co-CEO Peters sells shares worth over $3.1 million
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/netflix-coceo-peters-sells-shares-worth-over-31-million-93CH-3635279
Time Published: 2024-09-27T00:03:09Z
Full Content:
In a recent transaction, Gregory K. Peters, the Co-CEO of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), sold 4,392 shares of the company's common stock, netting over $3.1 million. The sale occurred on September 25, with the shares being sold at a price of $725 each. This sale was part of a prearranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. On the same day, Peters also acquired the same number of shares, 4,392, at a price of $155.35 per share, totaling approximately $682,297. This transaction was related to stock options exercised under the company's stock option plan. Following the sale, Peters still owns a substantial number of Netflix shares, with 13,090 shares remaining in his possession. These transactions indicate a significant trading activity by a top executive within the company, which can often be of interest to investors and market watchers. Netflix, a leading streaming entertainment service, has seen its stock price fluctuate in recent times, and transactions of this nature often draw attention to the company's stock performance and insider confidence. Peters' position as Co-CEO makes his trading activities particularly noteworthy to those following the company's financial developments. Investors and analysts often look to insider buying and selling as a signal of leadership's belief in the company's future prospects. However, it's important to note that there can be many reasons for insiders to sell shares, and such transactions don't necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company. The transactions have been publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing transparency and allowing the investing public to stay informed about significant insider trades at Netflix. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The entertainment services leader has also been making significant strides in its advertising business, with JPMorgan predicting that Netflix's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. Additionally, TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. On another front, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets faces regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. Evercore ISI has shown confidence in Netflix's potential, raising its stock target and maintaining an Outperform rating. This comes in the wake of Netflix's surge in upfront advertising commitments, largely due to the addition of NFL games on Christmas Day. These are the recent developments highlighting the growth and challenges faced by these companies in their respective markets. As investors digest the recent insider trading activity by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory K. Peters, it's worth considering the broader financial context provided by InvestingPro. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently boasts a market capitalization of $309.67 billion, underscoring its substantial presence in the entertainment industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at 43.56, reflecting a valuation that is high relative to near-term earnings growth, a point that is also highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. This may suggest that investors are expecting continued growth and are willing to pay a premium for the company's earnings potential. Another InvestingPro Tip indicates that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which can be a reassuring sign for investors concerned about the company's financial leverage. Moreover, the company's strong return over the last year, with a price total return of 88.41%, demonstrates its robust performance in the market. Additionally, with a high gross profit margin of 43.84% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, Netflix shows its ability to efficiently translate sales into profits. For those interested in more in-depth analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, including insights on the company's valuation multiples and profitability forecasts. In fact, there are 15 additional tips listed on InvestingPro for Netflix, which can be found at https://www.investing.com/pro/NFLX.

Full Content:
Leslie J. Kilgore, a board member at Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), has recently sold a total of 828 shares of the company's common stock, according to the latest SEC filings. The transactions, which took place on September 24 and 25, resulted in a total sale amount exceeding $598,000. On the first day, Kilgore sold 426 shares at a price of $720 each, and on the following day, another 402 shares were sold for $725 apiece. These sales are part of a pre-arranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell shares at predetermined times to avoid concerns about insider trading. In addition to the sales, Kilgore also acquired shares through the exercise of options on both days. The options were exercised at prices ranging from $146.92 to $155.35, with a total transaction value of $125,038 for the acquisition of 828 shares. The recent transactions have adjusted Kilgore's holdings in the video streaming giant, although the exact number of shares owned following the transactions was corrected due to an administrative error in previous filings. The corrected total reflects no omission of reportable transactions from prior filings. Investors often monitor insider trading activity as an indicator of executives' confidence in their company's prospects. Transactions by high-level insiders can provide valuable insights into the company's performance and strategic direction. Netflix continues to be a key player in the competitive streaming market, and the transactions by its executives are closely watched by investors seeking to understand the company's internal perspective. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The company will also hold a live video interview with its co-CEOs and CFO following the release. In other developments, Netflix has been making significant strides in its advertising business. Analyst firms JPMorgan and Evercore ISI have maintained an optimistic stance on the company, predicting that Netflix is set to become a major player in the advertising sphere as its ad-supported tier continues to gain traction. They also project that the streaming giant's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. The firm predicts that advertising will represent 13% of Netflix's total revenue by 2029. Meanwhile, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets is facing regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. These are the recent developments highlighting the growth and challenges faced by these companies in their respective markets. As Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to navigate the competitive landscape of the streaming industry, recent insider trading activity has caught the attention of investors. Leslie J. Kilgore's transactions are a normal part of executive stock management, but they also provide an opportunity to delve into Netflix's current financial standing through real-time data and expert analysis. InvestingPro data reveals that Netflix is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 43.56, reflecting investor confidence in the company's earnings potential. Despite this high multiple, an InvestingPro Tip suggests that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, indicating that its current earnings growth may justify the higher multiple. Furthermore, the company's revenue growth over the last twelve months stands at 13.0%, showcasing its ability to expand its top-line financials in a challenging market. Another noteworthy InvestingPro Tip is that Netflix's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, which is a positive sign of financial health, especially when considering the company's moderate level of debt. This aspect of Netflix's financials is crucial for investors who are assessing the company's ability to sustain and grow in the long term. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional insights into Netflix's financial performance and projections. There are currently 15 more InvestingPro Tips available for Netflix at https://www.investing.com/pro/NFLX, providing a comprehensive look at the company's valuation multiples, profitability, and market position. Netflix's position as a prominent player in the entertainment industry, coupled with a strong return over the last year, continues to make it a focus of investor interest. With the next earnings date approaching on October 17, 2024, all eyes will be on the company's performance and strategic initiatives moving forward.

The newly discounted Meta Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon, along with pre-orders of the new Quest 3S (128GB) and (256GB), with that sweet, speedy Prime shipping. All now include the promised bundle that includes Batman: Arkham Shadow and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. It wasn‚Äôt initially clear exactly when the newly reduced Quest 3 price would hit‚Äîwould we have to wait until Quest 3S actually launches on October 15th? Turns out, nope! The newly discounted Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon for $500. Just yesterday the headset was listing at its original price of $650. It also now includes a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. The Quest 3 (128GB) model is being phased out, with its own price reduced to $430 while stock remains. At the time of writing, Amazon says it‚Äôs already out of stock. But it‚Äôs currently offering an even further discounted refurbished Quest 3 (128GB) for just $380. The refurbished unit does not appear to include the Batman Arkham Shadow and Meta Quest+ bundle. As for Meta‚Äôs new Quest 3S, both models can be pre-ordered on Amazon ahead of the October 15th release date, with the (128GB) model for $300, and the (256GB) model for $400. Both include a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. Important note: right now the Quest 3S (128GB) is showing delivery from Amazon right around release date, but the Quest 3S (256GB) isn‚Äôt expect to deliver until the end of November. It‚Äôs unclear if this is a fluke. We‚Äôll be keeping our eye on the date, but in the meantime it looks like ordering the (256GB) headset direct from Meta may mean an earlier delivery. Other places to check for Quest 3S stock and favorable delivery dates include Best Buy, Newegg, Walmart, and Target. Not sure if you should get Quest 3 or Quest 3S? Compare the specs and get our take right here. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Meta finally getting the website-wide coverage. Glad to see no scams, over promising and under delivering, kickstarter swindels, no humble bundle sales etc on front page. I checked the 128GB Quest 3 on their site and Amazon right after the live Connect conference ended and it was out of stock already. Sounds like they're holding units back so people get the 512GB model instead, but that's just my speculation. Either way, what a lineup. 3S isn't for me (after 3's pancake lenses, I can't go back to fresnel) but it will definitely help VR in the same way Quest 2 did. What a nothingburger of a show ‚Ä¶. ILMI remains eerily silent. No HorizonOS update. Not even any new Home enviornments. *sigh* But these reduced prices should push VR ahead nicely during the Christmas shopping season. 8^ ) 512GB is nice, but I still have more then enough room free on my Pico 4 128GB (and I'm still using it as standalone as my wifi setup and PC are still too old to do proper wireless PCVR, still use my HTC Vive Pro/wireless module for that), so 512GB is still overkill for me at the moment, maybe with the next generation it might make sense for me to buy a headset with more GB's.

Title: Analysts Say Meta's Ambitions Make It a Top AI Pick
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/analysts-say-meta-s-ambitions-make-it-a-top-ai-pick-8718676
Time Published: 2024-09-26T20:38:50Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan and Jefferies analysts said Meta's (META) AI and metaverse ambitions make it a top pick after the tech giant's Connect event keynote Wednesday, where Meta unveiled several new products and AI features. The analysts said the event showcased Meta's progress in monetizing AI and made them more bullish on the stock, with JPMorgan analysts writing Thursday that they believe Meta has "earned the right to spend big on AI," given its "early AI benefits in both engagement and monetization." Jefferies analysts added that Meta's "proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products" added to their confidence in Meta's "new AI future." JPMorgan lifted its price objective for Meta's stock to $640 from $610, while Jefferies maintained its target of $600, representing about a 5.7% to 12.7% premium above Thursday's closing price of $567.84. Both targets were higher than the analyst consensus of $587.66 compiled by Visible Alpha, though all but one of the 31 analysts surveyed held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Meta shares finished slightly lower Thursday after hitting a record intraday high earlier in the session. They've gained about 60% since the start of the year.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg seems to have stuck the landing at Meta Connect

Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:58:23Z

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg needed less than an hour to wow Wall Street. He took the stage at Meta Connect in a T-shirt dedicated to himself and delivered a keynote that Wall Street seems to be responding well to. In fact, his showing was a "massive flex" for Zuckerberg, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Zuckerberg introduced a new lineup of Meta Quest headsets, some impressive AI features coming to the company's smart glasses, and gave the public a glimpse of the highly anticipated Orion holographic glasses. He even managed to sneak in one of the many memes about his stylish new look. Meta's stock jumped more than 2%, though did even out in the day following his big announcements. Over the last year or so, Zuckerberg has shown that he's not the 20-something CEO who burst onto the scene with Facebook anymore. He's turned 40, stepped up his style, and has morphed into a Meta influencer on Instagram. His confidence appears to have paid off onstage Wednesday, Stratechery founder Ben Thompson remarked. He compared Zuck's spirited keynote to that of the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. "I thought Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered one of the best tech keynotes in years," Thompson wrote. That's saying something, considering 2024 has been all about the buzzy events from Big Tech. Still, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on X that Meta's stock fading after the keynote is likely because Orion is "years away and overall there was not much new from the event." And Thompson, who described the holographic glasses as "spectacular," gave a similar caveat. "The glasses that I tried felt like a consumer-ready product, but they reportedly cost $10,000 each, and Meta has decided to hold off on shipping a consumer version until they can bring the price down," Thompson said in a Thursday blog post. Consumers may not line up for $10,000 glasses, but reactions to Meta's vision of the future suggest they're open to a new tech frontier. A frontier that might include fewer smartphones and more chunky glasses. Jump to

Title: Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?

Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes‚Äîfaster delivery, lower costs and broader selection‚Äîthat can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers‚ÄîAmazon, Microsoft and Alphabet‚Äîhave deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income. Amazon is a good buy for long-term investors. The stock is volatile in the short term, but the diversification of Amazon's business model and brand recognition within multiple sectors are positives.

Title: Baird sees upside for BlackLine shares, maintains $65 target

On Thursday, Baird reaffirmed its positive outlook on BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL), maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $65.00. The firm highlighted BlackLine as a bullish Fresh Pick, anticipating potential share price growth towards the end of the year. The optimism is partly based on the upcoming analyst day, which is expected to serve as a significant event for the company. The analyst day could reveal new medium- to long-term financial goals that may include an acceleration in revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion. These expectations are supported by recent industry checks which suggest a slight improvement in spending on financial suites and internal advancements within BlackLine. Baird's stance on BlackLine comes amid a cautious market sentiment, with the firm acknowledging that the company is not entirely "out of the woods." However, due to the current low expectations and valuation of the company's shares, Baird sees a path for upside potential. The firm's reiteration of the Outperform rating and price target reflects a belief in the company's ability to overcome present challenges. BlackLine's analyst day is being closely watched as a potential turning point for the company's financial trajectory and stock performance. In other recent news, BlackLine, Inc. reported a significant growth in its Q2 2024 earnings, with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. The company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics, had a strong quarter. In addition, BlackLine appointed David Henshall to its Board of Directors, a move expected to strengthen the company's strategic direction and governance due to Henshall's extensive background in enterprise software and financial management. In terms of investment activity, Soros Capital Management sold off its stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), while Jana Partners established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake in the company. The Saudi Public Investment Fund added call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), increasing the value of its U.S. stock holdings to roughly $20.7 billion. Looking ahead, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. These are the recent developments in the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives. As always, this information is based on the analysis of independent sources and does not contain personal opinions or predictions. As BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL) approaches its analyst day with Baird maintaining an Outperform rating, InvestingPro data underscores some financial metrics worth considering. The company's market capitalization stands at $3.15 billion, with a Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.66, indicating investor expectations of future earnings growth. Notably, BlackLine's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 has been 11.94%, reflecting a consistent upward trajectory in its financial performance. Two InvestingPro Tips that align with Baird's positive outlook include BlackLine's high shareholder yield and the expectation that net income will grow this year. With analysts predicting the company will be profitable this year, these tips further support the optimism surrounding BlackLine's financial outlook. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips on BlackLine's financial health and future prospects, which can be found at https://www.investing.com/pro/BL.

Title: A weight loss drug developer's stock soars after a $198 million IPO

Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:36:00Z
Full Content:
Shares of BioAge Labs (BIOA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on obesity drugs, opened 25% above its initial public offering (IPO) price on Thursday. The Richmond, California-based company set the price for its IPO at $18 a share Wednesday evening. The company aimed to raise nearly $200 million by offering 11 million shares at this price in an upsized IPO, according to a press release. BioAge initially said that it planned to only offer 7.5 million shares between $17 to $19 each. The company‚Äôs stock initially surged 24% to over $22 per share Thursday. It is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúBIOA.‚Äù The IPO comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk‚Äôs stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly‚Äôs has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors‚Äô bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In an SEC filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their ‚Äúhigh prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health‚Äù and ‚Äúoutsized commercial opportunities.‚Äù BioAge‚Äôs leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly‚Äôs Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk‚Äôs Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge‚Äôs IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Baird raises Meta Platforms stock target on ad checks
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/baird-raises-meta-platforms-stock-target-on-ad-checks-93CH-3634792
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:12:59Z

On Thursday, Baird, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), increasing the price target to $605 from the previous $530. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes after Baird's review of the company's advertising performance, which showed a positive trend, particularly in September when compared to August. The analyst from Baird expressed confidence in the near-term estimates for Meta Platforms, based on the Q3 advertising checks. The firm's decision to raise the 2025 growth target for Meta is attributed to steady macroeconomic trends and anticipated contributions from messaging, devices, and AI-driven platform enhancements. These factors are expected to bolster the company's growth trajectory. Despite projecting slightly lower operating margins than the consensus due to anticipated higher networking and depreciation costs associated with infrastructure development, Baird's revised price target is based on sector multiples that align with the industry. The firm believes this new target offers a substantial upside potential for Meta Platforms. Baird's analysis indicates that while the firm anticipates increased costs in building out Meta's infrastructure, the overall outlook remains positive. This is due to the company's robust advertising checks and the expected growth from new initiatives and enhancements to the platform. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen a price target increase to $640 from JPMorgan, emphasizing the company's advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Meta's AI, with substantial user engagement, is projected to become the world's most-used AI assistant by 2024. The company's significant investment in AI and the Metaverse, despite substantial projected losses, is backed by its strong operating results and early benefits of AI in user engagement and monetization. Oppenheimer maintains an Outperform rating for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., despite Meta's unveiling of its lightweight AR glasses prototype, Orion, which has not posed a significant threat to Apple's rumored Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, Citi maintains a Buy rating for Meta, highlighting the company's potential in AI innovation. JMP Securities has also raised its price target for Meta, lauding the company's AI-powered Orion glasses as revolutionary. Meta is also actively engaging with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, though it has chosen not to immediately join the European Union's AI Pact. In a move towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits, marking a significant step towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. As Baird sets a higher price target for Meta Platforms Inc., investors might find the real-time metrics from InvestingPro to be a valuable addition to the analysis. With a substantial market capitalization of $1.44 trillion, Meta's financial health and market position are critical to understanding its potential. The company's P/E ratio stands at a competitive 28.42, indicating a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings. Moreover, the adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 is slightly lower at 26.66, which could signal a favorable investment opportunity when paired with the company's near-term earnings growth. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's perfect Piotroski Score of 9, reflecting strong financial conditions, and the fact that the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility. These factors, combined with Meta's impressive gross profit margins of 81.49%, underscore the company's efficiency in generating income relative to its revenue. Additionally, Meta is trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 9.17, which investors may interpret as a sign of the company's robust assets and growth potential.

Editions: En/basketball/nba ESPN cuts ties with Zach Lowe Zach Lowe is a well-known figure in the basketball world, celebrated for his sharp analysis and insightful commentary on the NBA. As a senior writer for ESPN, he built a reputation over his more than ten years with the network, having first joined Bill Simmons' Grantland in 2012. Lowe's journey through the world of sports journalism has been marked by his keen understanding of the game, as well as his ability to break down complex strategies in a way that fans can appreciate. He also hosted the popular Lowe Post podcast and frequently appeared on NBA Today, making him a familiar face to basketball enthusiasts everywhere. Unfortunately, the latest buzz in sports media reveals that Lowe is no longer with ESPN. According to Andrew Marchand from The Athletic, Lowe's dismissal was part of a wave of layoffs that has recently hit the network, which also saw notable departures like Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder just before the football season kicked off. Reports suggest that Lowe's salary-over a million dollars a year-was a significant factor in the decision to let him go. As one insider noted, "His salary was the biggest factor in his dismissal from ESPN," highlighting the tough choices networks face in today's changing media landscape. Despite this setback, there might be a silver lining for Lowe. With NBC and Amazon ramping up their NBA coverage in anticipation of new rights agreements in 2025, opportunities could be on the horizon. Both networks are keen to bring in top-notch talent, and Lowe's experience and credibility in the field make him a prime candidate for their future plans. Interestingly, this shake-up in the sports media world comes on the heels of a surprising announcement from another basketball luminary, Adrian Wojnarowski. Woj, ESPN's lead NBA reporter, revealed his departure to become the general manager of St. Bonaventure's men's basketball team. In a heartfelt message posted on X, he shared, "This craft transformed my life," expressing his appreciation for the journey that sports journalism has taken him on. As for Lowe, while the road ahead may seem uncertain, his contributions to the NBA discourse have been invaluable, and his passion for the game will surely lead him to new and exciting ventures. The basketball community will be watching closely to see where this talented writer lands next. ¬© Unidad Editorial Informaci√≥n Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us

We provide what many‚Ä¶ More Info Kazakhstan has defended the country's second-largest lender as being "fully" compliant with sanctions against Russia after a scathing report saw around 20 percent wiped off the Nasdaq-listed Kaspi.kz's stock price. A September 19 report published by Culper Research poured doubt on the claim by fintech giant Kaspi that it lacks exposure to sanctions-struck Russia and raised concerns about the group's past affiliations to a relative of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev who was convicted by a Kazakh court of major embezzlement in 2022. In a September 19 statement, Kaspi.kz called Culper's report "misleading" and "inaccurate." The report, Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money For Criminals And Kleptocrats, focused on Kaspi.kz's issuance of bank cards to Russians, tens of thousands of whom arrived in Kazakhstan in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "As the U.S. and other nations continue to broaden sanctions against those found to be aiding Russia's wartime economy, we believe Kaspi now risks secondary sanctions," the report warned, justifying its "short" position on the company. Kaspi.kz is widely viewed as a success story in Kazakhstan, going from a relatively obscure bank to the country's leader in mobile payments and online marketplace services in some 20 years. SEE ALSO: In a September 23 statement, Kazakhstan's Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets called Kaspi "one of the country's systemically important and steadily developing banks, demonstrating sustainable growth and a high level of transparency." "The bank fully complies with the sanctions regime of the U.S., the European Union, and other foreign countries," the agency said, referring to the sanctions imposed on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main shareholders in Kaspi.kz are Kazakh billionaire Vyacheslav Kim, Georgia-born Mikhail Lomtadze, and Baring Funds, part of a Commonwealth of Independent States-focused private equity investor. Kaspi.kz listed in 2020 on the London Stock Exchange to become the its largest international tech public offering that year. In January it joined the Nasdaq in an initial public offering that saw the business valued at $17.5 billion. "Being the first company from Kazakhstan to successfully list on Nasdaq has obviously raised our profile amongst short sellers," Kaspi.kz said in its statement. Nazarbaev's nephew, Kairat Satybaldy, who once held a stake of around 30 percent in Kaspi, exited the company prior to the successful listings. In August, Lomtadze, who is CEO of Kaspi.kz, declared the company's intention to compete in the forthcoming privatization of Humo, neighboring Uzbekistan's state-backed payment system. In May, Lomtadze was revealed as the new owner of Wycombe Wanderers, a third-tier English soccer club.

Title: Amazon Employees Are Overwhelmingly ‚ÄòDissatisfied‚Äô With CEO Andy Jassy‚Äôs RTO Mandate
URL: https://observer.com/2024/09/amazon-employees-dissatisfied-ceo-andy-jassy-rto-mandate/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T17:49:07Z
Full Content:
The majority of Amazon (AMZN) employees are overwhelmingly unhappy with CEO Andy Jassy‚Äôs new return-to-office (RTO) mandate and are considering looking for new jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by Team Blind, an anonymous social platform for verified tech workers. A poll of more than 2,500 Amazon employees found that 91 percent are ‚Äúdissatisfied‚Äù with the new five-day in-office policy, which will come into effect in January 2025. ‚ÄúMy morale for this job is gone,‚Äù one said in a post. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Like most other tech companies, Amazon embraced remote work during the pandemic and has since reverted to a three-day in-office policy. Now, in an effort to rebuild the company‚Äôs culture and boost collaboration, Jassy‚Äôs RTO measure will only allow employees to work from home under extenuating circumstances like illnesses. The change will help ensure Amazon operates ‚Äúlike the world‚Äôs largest startup,‚Äù according to the CEO. Amazon employees don‚Äôt appear to share Jassy‚Äôs sentiments. Blind‚Äôs survey was conducted between Sept. 17 (a day after Jassy announced the RTO mandate) to Sept. 19 and found that three quarters of polled workers are considering looking for another job because of the new policy, while 32 percent said they know someone who has quit recently in response to Jassy‚Äôs mandate. Amazon‚Äôs HR is scrambling to fill the void. ‚ÄúI just had an Amazon recruiter blow up my phone and inbox five times in the last 24 hours to get me to provide my availability for an onsite interview,‚Äù said a Microsoft (MSFT) employee on Blind, adding that the recruiter said hiring managers are frustrated by the amount of Amazon candidates who have dropped out of interview processes in response to the news. For Amazon employees who were hired remotely, some are viewing the mandate as a thinly veiled strategy to cut headcount. The company‚Äôs workforce reportedly surged by nearly 75 percent between March 2020 and September 2021 alone. ‚ÄúMany of those folks are concerned that they don‚Äôt live anywhere close to an office, and they were hired with the expectation of being remote,‚Äù Rick Chen, Blind‚Äôs head of public relations, told Observer. Only a small percentage of employees are okay with RTO, with 9 percent saying they are ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù with Jassy‚Äôs mandate. ‚ÄúThere were some defenders of the policy, folks that prefer to work in the office and disliked remote work,‚Äù said Chen, who noted that a few Amazon employees also suggested that the end of remote work was caused by a few ‚Äúbad apples'‚Äù who ‚Äúruined it for everyone by taking quiet vacations or slacking off.‚Äù Another trending response to Amazon‚Äôs RTO policy is concern amongst other Big Tech workers that their company is next. In addition to worried employees from Apple (AAPL), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL), all of which also currently have a three-day in-office policy, Microsoft professionals‚Äîwho are allowed to work remotely 50 percent of the time‚Äîhave overwhelmingly voiced concerns that Microsoft will follow Amazon‚Äôs lead, according to Chen. This could be due to a geographic connection, as both Amazon and Microsoft are based near Seattle, Wash., he said. Such comments echo those made in 2022 and 2023 when large tech companies announced layoffs one after the other, said Chen. ‚ÄúThe was a feeling among professionals then, and it‚Äôs resurfacing now, that these companies are moving in lockstep with one another.‚Äù Blind has noticed an unusual uptick in search volume for the term ‚ÄúRTO‚Äù since Jassy‚Äôs announcement. While the phrase was previously searched by 500 employees on a daily basis at the beginning of 2024, that figure has since doubled this month to 1,000, Chen said. Other keywords like ‚Äúremote work‚Äù and ‚Äúflexible work‚Äù have also gained popularity in lieu of previously common search terms like ‚Äúlayoffs,‚Äù ‚Äúmanager‚Äù and ‚Äúpromotion.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very extreme shift in terms of what is capturing Amazon professionals‚Äô mind space right now,‚Äù said Chen.

Title: ESPN Laid Off Zach Lowe In Latest Shakeup To Their NBA Coverage
URL: https://uproxx.com/dimemag/espn-laid-off-zach-lowe-nba-coverage/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T16:33:47Z
Full Content:
In the past year-plus, ESPN has made some massive changes to their NBA coverage team. A year ago, Jalen Rose, Jeff Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson were all let go as part of company-wide layoffs. Doc Rivers stepped in to the lead booth along with Doris Burke but left for the Bucks head coaching job midseason. JJ Redick was elevated into Rivers‚Äô spot, but promptly took the Lakers job at the end of the season. Most recently, the league‚Äôs top newsbreaker, Adrian Wojnarowski, announced his shocking retirement to go work for his beloved alma mater, St. Bonaventure. With Woj already gone, another bomb dropped on Thursday when The Athletic‚Äôs Andrew Marchand brought word that ESPN was also laying off its top NBA writer and podcaster, Zach Lowe. Per Marchand, Lowe being let go falls in line with the Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder departures earlier this year, as Lowe made north of seven figures annually and was fired for budget reasons. Lowe was the most prominent NBA writer not only on ESPN‚Äôs staff, but arguably in the entire league. Beyond his written work, Lowe‚Äôs podcast, The Lowe Post, has been extremely popular and he has been a regular contributor on TV with NBA Today and other studio shows. Lowe had been at ESPN for more than a decade, starting his career at Grantland and then moving over to the dot com after they shuttered the Bill Simmons-led site. As such, many would expect the Ringer to be a potential landing spot for Lowe, who immediately becomes the most sought after free agent in the NBA writing and podcasting space. He also could be in play for NBC and Amazon, as they both get set to be new national broadcast partners of the NBA in 2025-26. As for ESPN, they are now tasked with not only reshaping their NBA coverage on the TV side, still needing to figure out their lead booth and the potential domino effect that will have on their other game broadcasts, but also their written coverage with Lowe and Woj both gone.

Time Published: 2024-09-26T14:25:59Z
Full Content:
Sep 26, 2024 In today‚Äôs industry news roundup: Giant German telco accuses Meta of ‚Äútwisting the facts‚Äù in the duo‚Äôs ongoing peering payments row; SpaceX is courting Vietnam, where it wants its Starlink operation to become a major broadband service provider, with talk of a $1.5bn investment; AT&T has deployed plug-and-play IT stacks to support its MVNO operations; and more! Deutsche Telekom has hit back at Meta‚Äôs decision, announced on 25 September, to end its direct peering relationship with the giant German telco, a move that might degrade the quality of service that DT‚Äôs mobile customers might experience when using popular applications, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Messenger. Meta accused DT of ‚Äúputting the open internet at risk and undermining net neutrality principles‚Äù and of ‚Äúusing its market power to put its subscribers in Germany behind a de facto paywall, potentially restricting their access to internet services that do not pay Deutsche Telekom‚Äù by asking Meta to pay for feeding traffic onto the telco‚Äôs networks. Now the telco has responded, saying that Meta is ‚Äúonce again twisting the facts,‚Äù and noting that historically Meta has paid a peering fee but stopped its payments during the Coronavirus lockdowns and is failing to renegotiate peering terms. According to DT, by ending its direct connection to the German operator, Meta is ‚Äúonce again abusing its overwhelming bargaining power to discredit legitimate concerns of the European telecommunications industry and consumers in order to avoid fair payment. This is not just about a difference of opinion between two companies,‚Äù it added, ‚Äúbut about the question of whether the power of the strongest prevails on the internet or whether there is a fair balance between all participants. We hope that this debate will not be carried out on the backs of the citizens. Even a company like Meta is not above the law.‚Äù Let‚Äôs hope this ultimately gets settled amicably and that millions of German users don‚Äôt end up suffering a degraded service. Deutsche Telekom and Meta aren‚Äôt the only ones currently engaged in a war of words. AT&T and Broadcom, which now owns US telco VMware, are locked in a legal battle over the terms of VMware‚Äôs licence agreement, as reported earlier this month. AT&T claims that Broadcom, which shifted VMware to a subscription model from its traditional perpetual licence model, is failing to honour a contract agreed with VMware before the chip giant closed its $61bn acquisition of the cloud platform vendor. Now, according to Ars Technica, Broadcom has responded with claims that AT&T has no case as it knew VMware was heading towards a subscription model before it was acquired by Broadcom, adding that the telco is resorting to ‚Äúsensationalism by accusing Broadcom of using ‚Äòbullying tactics‚Äô and ‚Äòprice gouging‚Äô. Such attacks are intended to generate press [coverage] and distract the court from a much simpler story.‚Äù This dispute will be closely watched by many telcos and other large VMware customers, which have found themselves having to deal with a less economic cost model in recent months. Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX plans to invest $1.5bn in Vietnam, the satellite company‚Äôs senior VP for global business and government affairs, Tim Hughes, told Vietnam‚Äôs State President T√¥ L√¢m during a meeting in New York this week, state-backed Viet Nam News has reported. ‚ÄúThe Vietnamese government is weighing the investment proposal‚Äù and is ‚Äúasking SpaceX to closely coordinate with relevant Vietnamese agencies and partners to complete investment procedures,‚Äù the news agency noted. SpaceX‚Äôs low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband service provider, Starlink, has been seeking clearance to provide services in Vietnam and it seems clear from the report that the Vietnamese government is open to having Starlink provide data connectivity in rural and remote areas and, in doing so, help the government respond to natural disasters more effectively. Starlink is currently in negotiations about how it can provide its services while meeting Vietnam‚Äôs foreign ownership rules: The country recently liberalised its digital infrastructure ownership regulations and that has resulted in growing interest and investments in the country as a hub for datacentres ‚Äì see Vietnam now a magnet for datacentre developers. AT&T has become the first US operator to achieve ‚ÄòRunning on ODA‚Äô accreditation from industry body the TM Forum. Running on ODA status is awarded to network operators that have built software stacks that conform with the forum‚Äôs open digital architecture (ODA) and open APIs, which enable a more modular, plug-and-play approach to telecom IT operations. AT&T adopted an ODA approach for the back-office operations of its MVNx Ecosystems unit, enabling mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that use AT&T‚Äôs mobile network to reach their customers ‚Äúto offer their own branded mobile services without having to invest in the expensive infrastructure typically required to operate a mobile network. ODA is a critical foundation for delivering this service, providing a common framework on which AT&T‚Äôs customers can innovate and offer new experiences by integrating network capabilities into their products and services,‚Äù noted the TM Forum in this announcement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm delighted that AT&T has further demonstrated its commitment to ODA and open API standards by gaining Running on ODA accreditation for its MVNx Ecosystems group,‚Äù noted Andy Tiller, EVP of member products and services at the TM Forum. ‚ÄúBy embracing ODA, AT&T is making it easier and faster for its partners to build and launch new services, leveraging the power of AT&T‚Äôs network. This means more innovative offerings and greater choice for consumers,‚Äù added Tiller. For more on ODA see DT, Orange et al join the ‚Äòrunning on ODA‚Äô club. Not for the first time, large language model (LLM) developer OpenAI, best known for its Chat GPT generative AI (GenAI) application, has suffered a top management meltdown. The company nearly imploded late last year when CEO Sam Altman was sacked, appeared to be hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and was then reinstated as head honcho of OpenAI. Now, just as the company is in discussions for a fresh round of funding ‚Äì reportedly $6.5bn at a valuation of $150bn ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs influential CTO, Mira Murati, quit suddenly on Wednesday, announcing her departure via a post on X. Murati was not alone ‚Äì VP of research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew also quit the company which, according to Reuters, might be shifting from ‚Äònot-for-profit‚Äô governance to a ‚Äòfor-profit‚Äô model. The trio‚Äôs departure marks something of an ongoing brain drain at OpenAI: In August, co-founder John Schulman joined rival AI firm Anthropic, and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, announced he was taking a sabbatical until the end of 2024. Earlier in the year, another co-founder, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, left the company. As you might expect, seasoned industry analyst Richard Windsor is not impressed with recent development at OpenAI: ‚ÄúHow this [company] is worth $150bn is beyond me,‚Äù he noted in his latest Radio Free Mobile blog. Orange‚Äôs decision to delist from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and voluntarily deregister with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced on Wednesday, is simply a matter of reducing the telco‚Äôs administrative workload, a spokesperson for the telco told Reuters after the announcement resulted in a dip in the company‚Äôs share price on the Paris stock exchange. Orange noted in its official announcement about the decision that the move ‚Äúis in line with the group‚Äôs aim to improve internal simplification and efficiency, while maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparent financial reporting. Orange remains fully committed to an open and frequent dialogue with US investors. This decision is expected to have no impact on Orange‚Äôs clients and partners or its commercial presence in the US.‚Äù Ericsson and optical networking module developer Nubis Communications used this week‚Äôs ECOC trade show, held in Frankfurt, to propose the use of co-packaged optics in future radio access network (RAN) architectures. ‚ÄúCo-packaged optics can enable high capacity at low energy consumption in future RAN networks, but dedicated developments are needed,‚Äù noted Ericsson in this blog. ‚ÄúIn a demo at ECOC 2024, Ericsson and Nubis showcased the ability to operate at high temperatures commonly found within radio units, compatibility with standard optical fibres, and implementation of automated eye-safety mechanisms. This can be very beneficial in the networks of the future, including 6G,‚Äù stated the vendor, pointing out that such technology is not currently used in RAN deployments as pluggable optics are currently meeting network operators‚Äô needs. However, data traffic growth will put a strain on pluggables, the partners suggested. To find out more about the case for co-packaged optics in the RAN, check out this blog. ‚Äì The staff, TelecomTV Oct 1, 2024 Oct 1, 2024 Oct 1, 2024 Oct 1, 2024 Oct 1, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Berenberg has maintained its Hold rating on Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) (NYSE: NVO) shares with a price target of DKK975.00. The firm's stance comes in light of investor sentiments around the potential impact of the Phase 3 (P3) trial results for CagriSema, an investigational therapy by Novo Nordisk. Market response to unfavorable trial outcomes is anticipated to have a greater effect on the company's stock value compared to positive trial results. The firm acknowledges the growing uncertainty in the competitive landscape and pricing dynamics within the industry, which were previously addressed in Berenberg's report titled "Embracing the curves of obesity." These factors, combined with the pivotal nature of the CagriSema trial results, are expected to keep a lid on Novo Nordisk's stock performance for the foreseeable future. Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with a focus on diabetes care and other serious chronic conditions. In other recent news, Novo Nordisk has been in the spotlight with its CEO, Lars Jorgensen, testifying on drug pricing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The focus of the hearing was the pricing of the company's weight-loss and diabetes medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk has also been investing heavily in research and development, with $4.2 billion spent in 2023 on diabetes and obesity alone. In parallel, BMO Capital Markets maintained an Outperform rating on Novo Nordisk, despite the mixed results from the phase 2a trial of Monlunabant, a weight loss drug. The trial exhibited a 5.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss at 16 weeks, which surpassed the performance of previous CB1 receptor antagonists at the 52-week mark. Despite the drug's strong efficacy, increasing the dosage beyond 10mg did not yield significant additional benefits. Additionally, a lawsuit against the U.S. law mandating drug price negotiations for Medicare was revived by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. This could potentially impact Novo Nordisk, as its diabetes medication, Ozempic, is under scrutiny for potential inclusion in the 2027 Medicare price negotiations. Despite disappointing results from the Phase II obesity trial of monlunabant, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on Novo Nordisk's shares. The trial showed a weight loss of approximately 6-7% at the 16-week mark, with some mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects noted. Lastly, Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a significant drop following the release of underwhelming trial results for its obesity pill, monlunabant. The trial results showed that monlunabant led to a weight loss of 6.5% after 16 weeks of treatment, which fell short of the anticipated 15% weight loss. As investors weigh Berenberg's hold rating and the potential outcomes of Novo Nordisk's CagriSema trials, it's crucial to consider the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Novo Nordisk boasts a robust market capitalization of $560.71 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the pharmaceuticals industry. The company's gross profit margin stands impressively at 84.53% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating strong profitability in its operations. InvestingPro Tips highlight Novo Nordisk's consistent dividend payments, with a track record of maintaining these for 36 consecutive years and raising them for the past 7 years. This could be a reassuring sign for investors looking for stability amidst the uncertainties surrounding the trial results. However, it's noteworthy that the company is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 41.96, suggesting a premium valuation that may already reflect high expectations from the market. For those seeking deeper insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips on Novo Nordisk, which could help investors make more informed decisions. With the next earnings date slated for November 6, 2024, keeping an eye on these metrics and the broader industry context could be pivotal. For further details and analysis, investors are encouraged to explore the full range of InvestingPro Tips available for Novo Nordisk.

Full Content:
In recent years, a relatively novel paradigm known as sustainable development has been introduced in response to concerns regarding the adverse impact of industrial activities on the environment and society. Managers in the food sector have been attempting to incorporate the principle of sustainable development in their supply chains owing to the paramount importance of social and environmental considerations in creating a competitive advantage for food products. To this end, we propose a multi-objective linear mathematical model considering the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental, and social, to design a sustainable food supply chain. Given today‚Äôs volatile business environment, we employ a robust optimization model by incorporating Conditional Value-at-Risk into the configuration of two-stage stochastic programming to tackle uncertainty and take up a risk-averse strategy in supply chain design. The model aims to identify the optimal production and delivery times of the products, investigate the effects of their perishability characteristic on inventory decisions, and assess the financial and environmental advantages of transportation decisions to improve the sustainability of logistics operations. A novel version of fuzzy goal programming approach is applied to solve the proposed model. Next, the applicability of the proposed model and its solution method is verified based on computational experiments on a real-world case study of a processed food company. Lastly, conflicts between the sustainability aspects are examined, and several sensitivity analyses on risk-aversion parameters are performed to provide managerial insights for industry executives seeking to optimize their network concerning sustainability issues and well-performance under worst-case scenarios.

A supply chain (SC) is a set of processes and flows that take place within and between different network components, including all parties directly or indirectly involved in fulfilling customers‚Äô demands. The food supply chain (FSC) is perceived as critical infrastructure as it ensures the wellbeing and food security of customers and yields profit for the firms involved [1]. According to projections, the global food demand is expected to rise by 50% by 2030 [2]. The food industry has experienced enormous challenges in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, has caused a worldwide spike in food demand over the last four years. Consequently, optimal decisions and efficient SC management are needed to respond to the continuously growing food demand [3]. Researchers and practitioners often classify SC decisions according to the length of the planning horizon into three categories: strategic, tactical, and operational [4]. Supply chain network design (SCND) comprises a set of crucial strategic decisions that determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities as well as the flow between them [5]. Through its influence on tactical and operational decisions, SCND significantly affects product quality, service level, material flow, customer satisfaction, and return on investment [6]. Typically, SCND in the food industry involves a high level of complexity due to the unique characteristics of foodstuff, such as perishability [7, 8]. Unlike many types of commodities, the demand for food is directly affected by the age and freshness of the products. Hence, failure to provide customers with high-quality, fresh food products often leads to a decrease in demand and thereby a dramatic decline in profitability [9]. Therefore, the perishable nature of food products imposes additional costs on the SC and requires continuous monitoring and replenishment of inventory levels in facilities to keep the inventory fresh and consumable [10]. Sustainability is among the significant issues to consider in the network design of FSCs. A SC is considered sustainable when the SC management policies and innovations of the organization are aligned with the principles of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development requires balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social welfare [11]. Sustainable Development Goals are a set of interconnected objectives proposed by the United Nations that call for emphasis on developing sustainable FSCs and effecting fundamental changes to improve the current food systems by 2030 [12]. The World Health Organization reports that FSCs release a significant amount of pollutants which are responsible for an estimated 20 to 30 percent of all environmental impacts [13]. Also, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), over one-third of all food produced annually is wasted. So, food waste is the biggest threat to global food security, and reducing food waste is essential to achieving global food security and sustainable development [14]. On the other hand, risk management in the field of SCND has drawn increasing interest among scholars and industry practitioners [15]. There is a high degree of interdependence between network nodes in any type of SC. Therefore, the risks generated in one node often spread quickly to others and negatively impact their operational and sustainability performance [16]. The occurrence of risks is widely believed to reduce the profitability and efficiency of the SC. In the case of FSCs, risks may also accelerate the products‚Äô deterioration rate, adversely affecting the environment and the firm‚Äôs reputation [17]. In this regard, effective risk management is essential to ensure sustainable operations [18]. SC risk refers to potential losses in terms of the objectives resulting from uncertainties in the features of the SC that can arise when a triggering event occurs [19]. In general, two types of risks can be associated with SCND problems: disruption risks and operational risks [20]. Disruption risks, including natural disasters (e.g. floods, earthquakes, and storms), human-made crises (e.g. wars and terrorist attacks), and technological malfunctions (e.g. equipment failure), can significantly undermine the performance of SCs. Operational risks, on the other hand, arise due to uncertainties in parameters such as supply, demand, transportation costs, etc. in dynamic business environments. To be precise, this type of risk is caused by the deviation of stochastic parameters from their expected values, leads to potential financial losses, and hampers the company‚Äôs efforts to meet its objectives [21, 22]. The risk-averse approach was developed to cope with uncertain parameters and guide managers when making decisions under uncertain conditions [23]. When addressing FSC problems, it is important to consider the above-mentioned concerns simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is among the first attempts to investigate a comprehensive risk-averse sustainable FSC design problem. In this regard, we model the risk aversion approach using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure to tackle random outcomes, volatility, and the inherent uncertainties of SCs. The proposed multi-period multi-objective programming model considers the perishability of food products based on the production and delivery times of the products and their shelf-life. Also, by addressing three objective functions, the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development are taken into consideration. We use preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), a novel multi-objective method, to solve the model. Lastly, we test the applicability of the mathematical model through computational experiments conducted on a numerical example and provide a number of managerial insights into some of the model‚Äôs critical parameters. The primary contributions, and novelty of this research can be summarized as follows: The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review of the subject. Section 3 describes the problem and its mathematical formulation. Section 4 presents the solution approach of the proposed model. Section 4 is devoted to the real-world case study, computational results and sensitivity analyses on some crucial parameters. Section 5 discuses some managerial insights and practical implications. Eventually, Section 6 provides conclusions and suggestions for future research. In this section, we review the relevant prior research from three different perspectives: (1) food supply chain network design (FSCND) problems, (2) sustainable SCND problems, and (3) risk-averse SCND problems involving risk measures and uncertainty. For the works reviewed in each subsection, we provide a brief summary and then mention the contributions of our study in that regard. Finally, at the end of this section, the details of the relevant prior research and the proposed study are summarized in Table 1 to clarify research gaps. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t001 Due to the growing importance of food, there has been an increasing number of studies on the subject of FSCND in recent years. Mohammed and Wang [24] proposed a multi-objective model to design and plan a meat SC. The researchers used three different methods to solve the multi-objective model and, in the end, opted to use the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to obtain the optimal solution from the Pareto frontier. Mohammed et al. [25] expanded the aforementioned approach by presenting a multi-objective model that used stochastic programming to deal with uncertainty. The authors employed the monitoring system known as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to satisfy the objectives of their model. Mohammed and Wang [26] presented another mathematical model to improve the distribution system of their earlier meat SC model. Aras and Bilge [27] presented a mixed-integer linear programming model to design a FSC in Turkey. The authors utilized the minimax regret approach to deal with uncertain demand. Mohebalizadehgashti et al. [28] formulated a meat SC with the objective of minimizing the total cost and CO2 emission, as well as maximizing the capacity utilization rate of the facilities in the network. Patidar and Agrawal [29] introduced a mixed-integer non-linear programming formulation to optimize the total cost of an agricultural SC. The results indicated that the expenses incurred by farm-to-market transportation were responsible for 85% of the total SC cost. To mitigate this defect, they proposed that the farmers be classified into clusters such that their crops would be aggregated in cluster centers and transported to the market from there. Gholami-Zanjani et al. [30] developed a two-stage scenario-based model with uncertain demand and disruptions caused by an epidemic. The researchers incorporated a number of resilience strategies into the core model to design a resilient FSC. Arabsheybani and Arshadi Khasmeh [31] proposed a robust bi-objective model to design a resilient FSC with the objectives being to maximize the total profit and total resilience score. Relying on four criteria to enhance the resilience of the SC (robustness, agility, leanness, and flexibility). Gholami-Zanjani et al. [13] developed a new framework to configure a resilient green meat SC. The authors implemented two resilience strategies to hedge the network against disruptions and solved the model by applying the sample average approximation and lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff methods. The concept of sustainability has gained popularity in the last few years since it demonstrates that a SC‚Äôs competitive advantages cannot only be achieved through optimizing its economic aspects [32]. Sustainability is more emphasized in some industries, such as the food industry, due to the specific characteristics of their products. In this subsection, we survey some of the studies on sustainable SCND problems. Allaoui et al. [2] came up with a hybrid two-stage methodology to optimize a sustainable SC in which sustainable suppliers are selected using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Yakavenka et al. [33] presented a distribution network design problem for perishable food products considering the three dimensions of sustainability. The proposed model‚Äôs objectives were to minimize the total cost, total emission of transportation modes, and transportation times. Mohammadi et al. [34] developed a sustainable multi-objective model for a processed food company. The decisions made by proposed model included facility location, aggregating the flow of materials between facilities, and selecting the type of product delivery (either directly from plants or indirectly from distribution centers). Jouzdani and Govindan [35] introduced a non-linear mathematical model to design a sustainable perishable FSC. In this study, the perishability of the products followed the Weibull distribution and was affected by the use of vehicle refrigerator. Goodarzian et al. [36] formulated a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a citrus fruit supply chain network. The contribution of this paper is the development of a mathematical model for designing a three-echelon network that takes into account coefficient water, CO2 emissions, and time window concurrently. Kalantari and Hosseininezhad [12] developed a sustainable model considering four risk factors: delays, fluctuation of exchange rates, quality of raw materials and production. The authors used the cross-entropy method to solve the model for large instances using the optimization software GAMS. Momenitabar et al. [37] introduced a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that minimizes total and environmental costs, including energy consumption and pollution emissions, and maximizes employment opportunities. To reduce the environmental impacts, the circular economy concept has been addressed in this study. Momenitabar et al. [38] developed a mathematical model for designing a sustainable bioethanol supply chain network. In order to determine the best method to predict the actual amount of demand, they compared three popular machine-learning methods. In addition, the authors considered two meta-heuristic algorithms to find pareto optimum solutions for the large-scale problem. Goodarzian et al. [39] investigated a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to establish a sustainable citrus closed-loop supply chain network. The authors included the circularity strategy and the triple bottom lines of sustainability into their model. Mohammadi et al. [40] presented a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a sustainable FSC for perishable products. To show the validity of proposed model, they conducted several sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters and applied the model in a food company. Lastly, Momenitabar et al. [41] integrated machine-learning algorithms with quantitative optimization modeling to design a sustainable bioethanol supply chain. In this work, three machine-learning approaches have been applied to forecast the bioethanol demand as model inputs. A few studies have considered risk-aversion in SCND and their mathematical models, some of which are presented in this subsection. Noyan [42] used two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) to design a disaster management SC under disruption and operational risks. In order to address the variability of non-deterministic parameters, the author incorporated the CVaR measure into the stochastic programming framework. Ahmadi-Javid and Seddighi [43] developed a location-routing optimization model under disruption risks to design a SC consisting of manufacturers and distributors in which a single type of commodity is distributed to several consumers. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model under three risk measurement policies: optimistic, cautious, and pessimistic. The authors utilized the expectation, CVaR, and worst-case risk measures to calculate the risk under each policy. Soleimani and Govindan [44] used a risk-averse TSSP method to plan and design a reverse SC in which the CVaR was used to evaluate the risk associated with the uncertainty in prices and demand for returned products. Govindan and Fattahi [45] proposed a multi-period optimization model under demand uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the total SC cost. The problem was formulated by incorporating TSSP and the CVaR into the model to address risk-aversion. Rahimi and Ghezavati [46] developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to design and plan a sustainable reverse logistics network under uncertainty. The authors applied a risk-averse TSSP approach, utilized the CVaR to cope with the deviation of demand and investment rate from their expected values, and solved a numerical example to obtain potential managerial insights. Rahimi et al. [47] investigated risk-averse SCND by proposing a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to configure a sustainable SC in which the CVaR risk measure was assimilated into the model. This paper contributes mainly by offering various discount policies for selling products to customers. Lotfi et al. [48] developed a model to design an antifragile, sustainable, and agile network that integrates these concepts taking into account several factors such as resilience, risk, robustness, and environmental issues. The authors incorporated the Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) measure into the stochastic programming framework to address risk-aversion. The cost function of this model encompasses the expected value, maximum, and EVaR. Lotfi et al. [49] proposed a novel hybrid method of robust optimization which employs a stochastic approach to address uncertainty and risk management. The objective function of the model given involves maximizing the coefficients of mean and minimum profits under multiple scenarios, while considering an energy-aware constraint. Lotfi et al. [50] introduced a novel viable SC in which robust stochastic optimization is combined with CVaR as risk criteria to ensure an optimal approach. The objective function of their model minimizes the expected value, maximum, and CVaR of cost. Lotfi et al. [51] presented a new data-driven robust optimization in viable supply chain network design by utilizing Open Innovation (OI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT). The authors employed a robust stochastic optimization technique and assimilated the CVaR measure into the model to effectively tackle uncertainty as well as risks. As our review of the literature reveals, several studies have investigated sustainable FSCND, but no comprehensive study has been conducted on risk-averse SCND while developing a sustainable FSC at the same time. To address this gap, we present a sustainable risk-averse FSC by incorporating the CVaR into our model to develop a robust network in an uncertain environment. Moreover, a few papers have considered the specific characteristics of food products, such as perishability, in their proposed FSCs (e.g. [13, 30, 34]). Therefore, we also incorporate perishability and its implications into our model by considering the shelf-life of foodstuff to prevent the decay of finished products along the SC. We discovered that making inventory and transportation decisions based on integration of production and delivery times may bridge a significant gap in the literature on FSCND. Furthermore, in the majority of the research papers on sustainability, the only instance of social impact addressed by the authors appeared to be job creation, and other factors such as safety had been largely neglected. Our research methodology outlining the steps undertaken is summarized by the flowchart presented as Fig 1, acting as a guide for the research process. In light of the gap analysis presented in this subsection, and based on Table 1, the present study may contribute to the literature in the following ways: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g001 In this study, we develop a risk-averse sustainable FSC considering the perishability of the food products. The proposed SC is multi-echelon, multi-period, and multi-product, and consists of raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers (DCs), and retailers with uncertain demand. The process of material flow begins by purchasing raw materials from the suppliers. Next, the products are manufactured in the factories and shipped to the retailers through the DCs by transportation modes. Fig 2 graphically illustrates the structure of the proposed FSC. To design the aforementioned network, a two-stage multi-objective programming model is presented. In this model, the three dimensions of sustainability are introduced in the form of three objective functions. In the first objective, the economic dimension of sustainability is addressed by minimizing the total costs of the network composed of the first stage costs, second stage costs, and CVaR costs. The environmental dimension of sustainability is the second objective function which minimizes the total environmental effects of the network. Total environmental effects of the SCN are comprised of carbon released by establishing facilities, production, handling processes and transportation. Lastly, social dimension of sustainability is considered in the third objective which represents the social aspect of the SC and aims at maximizing the total social effects of the network, which includes of created job opportunities and worker‚Äôs lost days multiplied to their given weight.

In this type of framework, decisions are made over two sequential stages. In the first stage, decision-makers should make scenario-independent decisions that typically determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities. Scenario-independent decisions are made before the realization of uncertain parameters (e.g. demand, supply, transportation costs, etc.) and generate the first-stage (a.k.a. design stage) costs. In the second stage, scenario-dependent decisions (e.g. material flow, inventory level, production rate, etc.) are made regarding the second stage (a.k.a. planning stage) costs after the values of uncertain parameters have been realized [52]. Eq (1) gives the first objective function, i.e. economic sustainability, which aims to minimize total cost of the SC, consisting of first-stage, second-stage, and CVaR costs. The components of Eq (1) are formulated as follows: (2) (3) (4) Eq (2) obtains the fixed costs of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eq (3) calculates the second-stage costs, consisting of the costs of purchasing raw materials, production, distribution, inventory holding in manufacturers and DCs, transportation, and lost demand in retailers, with respect to the set of scenarios. The last component of Eq (1) relates to the costs of the CVaR, which is defined as Eq (4) [22]. Eq (5) states the second objective which represents environmental sustainability and minimizes the total environmental impacts of the proposed SC, comprising the carbon emitted in the processes of establishing the facilities, production, handling, and transportation of the products. The terms of Eq (5) are presented as follows: (6) (7) (8) (9) Eq (6) computes the amount of carbon emitted in the process of establishing the manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (7) and (8) compute the environmental impacts of production and handling processes in the manufacturers and DCs, respectively. Eq (9) determines the amount of carbon emitted from the transportation of products. The first term of Eq (9) states the environmental impacts of transporting raw materials from suppliers to manufacturers, while the second term represents the environmental impacts of transporting the finished products from manufacturers to DCs. The last term of Eq (9) calculates the environmental impacts of transporting the products from DCs to retailers. Eq (10) concerns social sustainability and aims to maximize the total social impacts of the proposed SC which consists of the number of job opportunities created and workers‚Äô lost days multiplied by their weight. The components of Eq (10) are defined as follows: (11) (12) The first component of Eq (10) states the number of jobs created by establishing manufacturers and DCs, presented as Eq (11). The second component, calculated by Eq (12), pertains to the number of lost days caused by work-related damages during the process of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (13) and (14) ensure that each manufacturer and DC can be established only at one capacity level. Eq (15) indicates the amount of raw material purchased from suppliers. Due to the fact that food products are inherently perishable, inventory management and transportation decisions between network nodes require applying more constraints compared to other products. Therefore, in this paper, by considering the shelf life, production and delivery times of products individually, we intend to prevent the perishability of products along the network. In fact, the level of products inventory and the amount of products flow between network nodes are associated with the optimal production and delivery times as well as shelf life of the products. To address this issue, Eqs (16) to (29) have been defined in the proposed model. Eqs (16) to (18) calculate the inventory level of products according to their shelf-life for each manufacturer at different periods. Eqs (16) and (17) show the level of on-hand inventory at time periods shorter than the shelf-life of the product. However it is worth mentioning that in the first period, no inventory is added from the previous period. Therefore, the inventory levels of the products in each manufacturer for t = 1 < slp and 1 < t < slp are calculated separately using Eqs (16) and (17), respectively. Eq (18) computes the inventory level at time periods longer than the shelf-life of the product. Eqs (19) and (20) compute the flow of each product from a manufacturer to a DC considering its production period. As mentioned in Eqs (16) to (18), the product flows between the relevant nodes are formulated differently for t < slp and t ‚â• slp. Eqs (21) and (22) present the inventory balance of products in each manufacturer based on their production period. Similar to Eqs (16) to (18), the inventory levels of products in the DCs for different intervals of t are calculated by Eqs (23) to (25). Eqs (26) and (27) define the flow of each product from a DC to a retailer based on its production time. Eqs (28) and (29) determine the inventory levels of DCs based on their delivery periods. Eq (28) indicates when the delivery period is equal to the time period, the inventory level of DCs is equal to the quantity of products delivered from manufacturers to DCs subtracted by the flow of products to retailers. Eq (29) states that when t ‚àí e < slp, the current inventory level is equal to the inventory level of the previous period subtracted by the flow of products to the retailers. Eq (30) determines the quantity of products shipped to retailers as well as the quantity of shortage. Eq (31) defines the raw material procurement capacity of suppliers. Eq (32) presents the production capacity of each manufacturer at each time period. Eqs (34) and (35) express the maximum throughput capacity of each manufacturer and DC, respectively. Eqs (35) to (37) show the capacity constraint of the transportation modes. Eqs (38) to (40) state the decision variables whose values should be zero. Eq (41) calculates the deviational value that exceeds the value-at-risk. Finally, Eqs (42) and (43) express the types of the decision variables. In the process of solving real-world problems, there is often more than one objective function, each offering a specific solution if optimized separately. Such circumstances require that a trade-off be established among the objective functions and multi-objective optimization approaches were originally conceived precisely to solve such problems. One of the most commonly-used optimization approaches, introduced by Charnes et al. [53], is known as goal programming. In this approach, decision-makers define an expectation level for each objective function as its goal and try to minimize the deviation from these expectation levels [54]. Ostensibly, decision-makers should accurately determine the expectation level of each objective; however, in reality, the uncertainty of the available information makes it nearly impossible to assign perfectly accurate levels to the objectives. Fuzzy sets theory, introduced by Zadeh [55], is regarded as an effective approach to decision-making under uncertainty. Arikan and G√ºng√∂r [56] then combined fuzzy set theory and goal programming to create the fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach. Recently, a novel extension of FGP, known as preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), was proposed by. The model was developed with different priorities and had the advantage of largely eliminating the limitations of the original approach. One such limitation was that decision-makers were required to set a precise lower bound for the satisfaction degree of the objectives. Moreover, it was often the case that in order to achieve the minimum satisfaction degree for one of the objectives, a better total satisfaction degree for all objectives had to be eliminated. The new model identified and mitigated this issue, accepting solutions that have a higher satisfaction degree while taking into account the priority of the objectives in question. In this approach, the goals are prioritized and the satisfaction degree of the first priority should be greater than the others. By adding certain equations to constraints that illustrate the importance of each goal, this priority structure is taken into account. PFGP is applicable to multi-objective problems that involve uncertainty and objectives with different importance degrees [57]. In the present study, we adopt the PFGP method as it eliminates the requirement that a fixed value be determined for both the objective function and the satisfaction degree. It also takes uncertainty into account when determining the goal of each objective. Using this method, decision-makers can easily adjust the priority of the objective functions and observe the results of the optimal solution [58]. The notations of PFGP are as follows (Table 3): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t003 Using the notations presented above, the mathematical model based on PFGP can be expressed as follows: (44) s.t. Eq (44) expresses the goal of the PFGP approach which is maximizing the total satisfaction degree. In Eq (45), hc(X) represents the constraints of the main model. Eqs (46) and (47) determine the satisfaction degrees of the goals for minimization objectives, where ‚àÄi = (1, 2,‚Ä¶, ii) is the set of minimization objectives. Eqs (48) and (49) calculate the satisfaction degrees of the goals for maximization objectives, where ‚àÄi = (ii + 1,‚Ä¶, i) is the set of maximization objectives. Eq (50) relates to the priority of the goals, stating that the most important objective should achieve a satisfaction degree greater than or equal to the other objectives. Finally, Eq (51) defines the type of the decision variables of the PFGP model. In this section, we introduce the case study used in this research and the input data of its parameters. The problem is then solved using PFGP, and the analysis results are presented at the end. Due to the constantly evolving lifestyles of consumers, the processed food industry plays a significant role in providing the population‚Äôs needs by producing and distributing a variety of products, also appearing to be on a growing trajectory. In this study, we investigate a processed food company as a real-life case study to measure the effectiveness of our model. The manufacturing plant is located in Tehran province, Iran, and the products are sold on domestic and international markets. The manufacturer procures its required raw materials, mainly chicken and beef, from multiple suppliers. In the proposed model, we consider only two types of finished products: hamburger 80% beef, and sausage 70% chicken. Because of their perishability, the products are transported by refrigerated trucks. The network size of the case study detailed in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t004 In this study, we focus on three three modes of transportation: light truck, medium truck, and heavy truck. The data used in the present research on the capacities of transportation modes and the quantities of CO2 emissions have been retrieved from Mohammed et al. [25] and Nayeri et al. [59] (see Table 5). Three levels of capacity: low, medium, and high, with different costs, carbon emissions, and job opportunities have been considered for establishing facilities in potential locations. Tables 6 and 7 show the values of the parameters related to each manufacturer and DC with different capacity levels. Also, we examine three prominent demand scenarios for each retailer in our case study: the most pessimistic, the most probable, and the most optimistic. Numerous studies in the literature on SCND problems have repeatedly implemented the same three demand levels to generate their scenarios and have subsequently attested to the reliability and efficiency of the method (e.g. [22, 60, 61]). According to the historical data obtained from the case study as well as the experts interviewed for the purposes of this paper, the occurrence probability of scenarios are estimated at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. Tables 8 to 11 detail the costs of the model, including the fixed cost of establishing facilities, operational cost, raw material purchasing cost, and holding cost of finished products. Since the finished products discussed in this study have different raw material consumption rates, weights, shelf-lives, and production processes, the production capacity and costs associated with each type of product vary, as well (see Table 12). In addition, Table 13 provides the data on the corresponding values of each retailer‚Äôs demand under each scenario. The environmental parameters are presented in Tables 14 to 16. We have gathered the data on environmental parameters from several sources, including the food carbon footprint calculator, an online platform provided by MyEmissions.green, and also from academic articles (e.g. [62]). The values of the social parameters can be found in Tables 17 and 18. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t008 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t010 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t014 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t015 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t016 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t017 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t018 The proposed mathematical model is solved by the optimization software GAMS using the case study parameters. Furthermore, Œª1 > Œª2 > Œª3 is the fuzzy satisfaction degree reflecting the importance degrees of the objective functions according to the experts‚Äô opinions. Table 19 details the output generated from solving the model. In addition, the numerical results of some analyses performed on the model are presented in the following subsections. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t019 The majority of stochastic programming models addressing food supply chain (FSC) under uncertainty are usually designed to be risk-neutral. In this paper, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming is aiming to trade off the expected total cost and risk cost, based on a predetermined level of responsive risk aversion employing CvaR as a coherent risk measure. The purpose of this subsection is to compare the main risk-averse problem (considering CvaR) and risk-neutral problem (without considering CvaR). The comparison of the economic objective function of the proposed model between risk-averse and risk-neutral problems is illustrated in Fig 3. As can be seen, the value of economic objective function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Since it overcomes the variability of the uncertain parameters, provides more robust solutions compared to a risk-neutral problem in presence of uncertainty, and assist decision makers when faced decisions with uncertain outcomes. It is worth noting that decision-makers can achieve higher levels of risk aversion by increasing the value of network costs, which will cause the model to behave more conservatively and generate better solutions in worst-case scenarios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g003 In this subsection, we intend to examine the service level of the SC in terms of lost demands. In the long run, unmet demands can result in customer dissatisfaction which, in turn, could negatively affect the firm‚Äôs reputation. Consequently, we can conclude that the more the level of service provided by the SC, the less lost demand will occur. In simple terms, lost demand is a consequence of increasing the total cost with the purpose of establishing balance between economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Table 20 details our analysis of the total value and percentage of lost demands for finished products under each scenario. The finished products in each scenario have varying amounts of unfulfilled demands in which the abovementioned reason is mainly responsible for them. Another noteworthy point inferred from the table is that when the demand for the finished products rises by 50% in the in probable scenario, the quantities of lost demand for the two products increase by 32.1% and 35.7%, respectively. It may thus be concluded that insufficient production capacity is the most likely culprit for the resulting unmet demand. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t020 This section is dedicated to sensitivity analyses on the sustainability dimensions. For this purpose, we solve the proposed model in three different types: economic, green, and sustainable, and then proceed to discuss the results. In the economic type, only the economic objective function is addressed in the model; in the green type, both the economic and environmental objective functions are addressed simultaneously; and in the sustainable type, the problem is solved by considering the economic, environmental, and social objective functions, i.e. all three dimensions of sustainability. According to Table 21 and Fig 4, solving the problem in the economic type leads to the economic and environmental objective functions to take their best and worst values, respectively. However, focusing solely the economic dimension obtains the best value for the economic objective function. In the green type, by adding an environmental dimension to the problem, the opposite of the results of the economic type is obtained. That is, the economic and environmental objective functions take their worst and best values within the specified cases, respectively. Based on this observation, we may conclude that the green type increases the value of the economic objective in order to ensure a better value for the environmental objective. In the sustainable type, in order to establish a balance between the three dimensions of sustainability, economic and environmental objectives both gain values that lie between the values they were assigned in the economic and environmental types. Moreover, Table 19 indicates that the sustainable type results in a 9% increase in the total cost, as well as a 28.3% decrease in the environmental impacts, and a 53.6% increase in the social impacts compared to the economic type. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t021 In the PFGP approach, the influential factor is the priority of objective functions, which is defined by their fuzzy satisfaction degrees (Œªi). Therefore, we solve the model in six cases to assess the impact of changes in the objective functions‚Äô priority on the problem. Table 20 shows the results of solving the model in the presented cases. Based on Table 20 and Fig 5, the conflicts between the economic and environmental goals are evident. In case 1, when the economic objective function takes the highest priority, it is assigned the best value, while the environmental objective function is assigned the worst. In Case 2, in which the priority of the second objective function is higher than the other two, the environmental impact is given the best value, with the economic objective function getting the worst. In case 3, where both the environmental and economic objectives are equally important, the value of both objective functions is squarely between their worst and best values. Table 22 and Fig 6 illustrate the conflict between the economic and social objective functions. In case 4, when the economic objective has the highest priority, it is assigned the best possible value. Conversely, the social objective function receives the worst value among all the cases. Based on case 5, when the social objective function becomes the top priority, it gets the best value, while the economic objective function has the worst value. Finally, in Case 6, in which the social and economic objectives share the top priority, the value of both objective functions is between their lowest and highest. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t022 In this section, we assess the risk-aversion parameter in order to clarify how it may affect the objective functions of the proposed model and the obtained solutions. Consider an experiment with four different Œ≤ values where the value of Œ∏ = 0.5 remains fixed to better comprehend how Œ≤ impacts the model. Table 23 and Fig 7 show that as Œ≤ grows larger, the value of the economic objective function increases, as well. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t023 Since CVaR measures the mean value of the worst (1 ‚àí Œ≤) % of the total expected cost, when the value of Œ≤ increases, the risk aversion behavior of the proposed model improves. Hence, the model behaves more conservatively and the CVaR concentrates on the greater realization of total cost. Total costs are comprised of the first-stage costs, CVaR costs, and second-stage costs. It is also important to note that, the first- stage costs and consequently the number of established facilities do not change in response to varying risk parameters since they are not a function of CVaR. In other words, CVaR costs affect the second-stage costs. In general, we may draw the conclusion that a high risk-aversion strategy would result in higher levels of the second-stage costs and the total costs. To better comprehend this mechanism, we need to examine how Œ≤ influences the environmental and social objective functions. As previously mentioned, by raising the value of Œ≤ and giving the model a risk-averse attitude, the value of the economic objective function increases and the model should become more conservative, resulting in an upward trend in the value of the environmental impact and a downward trend in social impacts. This conflict can be clearly observed in Table 23 and Fig 8. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g008 To examine the impact of changes in demand on the value of the objective functions, we solve the model in five demand modes: -30%, -15%, 0%, +15%, and +30%). The results of the sensitivity analyses are shown in Fig 9. As expected, rising demand values increase the total SC costs. This may be a consequence of establishing new high-capacity facilities, increased raw material procurement and production of finished products, as well as transportation between the network nodes to satisfy the demand. Furthermore, as more high-capacity facilities are activated and transportation between facilities is raised, which leads to the use of higher capacity transportation modes, the adverse environmental impacts of the network increase. In addition, as the demand grows, the model tends to create more jobs by establishing more facilities and activating higher capacity levels to meet the retailers‚Äô demand. In case of a significant increase in demand, the proposed model tries to keep the total SC costs at a minimum by not establishing new facilities. This is because the costs of opening new facilities to fully meet the demand outweigh the costs incurred by lost demands. Therefore, the model prefers to avoid establishing new facilities, activates lower capacity levels, and only partially satisfies the demand. This results in a less steep upward trend in total cost and social impact. As Fig 9 indicates, the reaction of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions in the proposed model to changes in demand under different modes complies with the above-mentioned explanations, indicating the proper logic of the model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g009 Taking into account the current situation of the case study, which consists of one medium-capacity manufacturer and two high-capacity DCs, the values of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1999168 √ó 107, 79453400, and 529.2, respectively. In accordance with the opinions of the case study experts, the potential locations for construction of new facilities were selected based on the company‚Äôs revision plans regarding its supply chain to gain a larger market share. The results of solving the proposed model for the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1952306 √ó 107, 75179800, and 491.4, respectively. Fig 10 compares the proposed and current conditions of the case study and displays the values of the model‚Äôs objective functions. As can be observed, compared to the current situation, the model proposed in this research causes a 2.3% drop in costs, a 5.4% drop in adverse environmental impacts, and a 7.1% drop in social impacts. This is achieved by constructing a medium-capacity manufacturers along with one medium-capacity and two low-capacity DCs. Thus, it can be said that the proposed model, whose candidate locations for the company‚Äôs future plans were selected by the experts, improves the current situation in terms of costs and environmental impacts. In addition, considering the high priority of the total SC costs, the downward trend of the social objective function in favor of the economic objective function seems logical. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g010 In this study, we developed a sustainable risk-averse model to design a SC for processed food products under uncertain conditions. To this end, a multi-period multi-objective model was presented to make decisions on facility location, optimal sourcing, transportation mode selection, capacity planning, and inventory management. The resulting model addresses three dimensions of sustainability as economic, environmental, and social objective functions, thereby minimizing the total cost and carbon emissions and maximizing the number of job opportunities created and safety of the FSC. The main contribution of this research to the literature may lie in our decision to incorporate a risk measure into the design of a sustainable FSC; an innovation that has never been attempted by previous researchers. Furthermore, we applied a scenario-based TSSP approach to cope with the uncertainty of demand for finished products and utilized a novel PFGP multi-objective method to solve the mathematical model. Also, we compared our proposed model with a situation in which the CvaR risk measure was not taken into account. Finally, results show that the value of cost function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Because it behaves more conservatively and offers more resilient solutions in the presence of uncertainty compared to a risk-neutral problem. Practitioners and academics can achieve significant outcomes by solving real-world case studies aligned with distinctive industry characteristics. Selecting the processed food industry in Iran and optimizing FSC, which contributes to all dimensions of sustainability, can be beneficial for food industry executives. Several useful managerial insights can be drawn from the analysis of the numerical results, including the following: This research advances the field of FSC by addressing perishability in inventory decisions based on the production and delivery times of the products. A scenario-based TSSP approach that incorporates CvaR as a risk criteria into the objective function is employed to ensure a robust network in an uncertain environment. Finally, investigating a real case study in processed food industry, several strategic decisions including facility location, supplier selection, capacity planning, and transportation mode selection are made in the proposed FSCN. Based on sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters, findings of our research are as follows: The limitations of the research are obtaining optimal solutions on a large scale and within an acceptable timeframe. To address this issue, we recommend applying exact and evolutionary algorithms in combination with novel heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, such as those put forward by [63‚Äì65]. Finally, the authors would like to recommend the following as potentially promising subjects for further investigation. It is possible to experiment with different quality levels for raw materials and suppliers can place various purchase discounts based on the quality and quantity of the raw materials required by manufacturers. Additionally, exploring global SC issues and factors may be a highly relevant research route, as most leading SCs in various sectors operate globally today. Furthermore, incorporating other risk criteria, such as Entropic VaR (EVaR) and Robust CvaR (RCVaR) may provide significant benefits for conservative decision-makers as future research, aiming to enhance the robustness of the model‚Äôs performance and enable it to effectively handle fluctuations [66]. Utilizing alternative methods, like stochastic, fuzzy, and robust optimization techniques that incorporate data-driven uncertain parameters can offer risk-averse decision-makers a more accurate representation of the situation, enabling them to make optimum decisions while reducing risks [64, 66, 67].

We recently compiled a list of the 10 best performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stands against the other Top-Performing Warren Buffett Stock of 2024. Warren Buffett has etched his name as the most successful investor on Wall Street by steering a small company into a trillion-dollar empire. The milestone stems from the billionaire investor‚Äôs value investing strategy that has always focused on undervalued stocks with tremendous upside potential. In a year where the overall market has been on an upward trajectory thanks to solid financial results amid a resilient economy and expectations of interest rate cuts, Buffett has outperformed the overall market. His investment firm gaining more than 28% compared to a 17% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period underscores Buffett‚Äôs competitive edge in picking and investing in market-beating stocks. READ ALSO: 14 Worst 52-Week High Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers and 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now. Buffett, who rose to prominence in the 1960s, has transformed his investment firm into a conglomerate with stakes in companies in the insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy sectors. According to Andrew Kligerman, TD Cowen‚Äôs Berkshire analyst, Buffett‚Äôs performance in 2024 is a testament to his stock-picking skills focused on businesses trading at relatively lower valuations. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has been in defensive mode despite the stellar performance for the better part of 2024. Concerned by valuations getting out of hand amid the high interest rate environment and deteriorating economic conditions, Buffett has dumped massive amounts of stocks in companies whose valuations got out of hand. With the massive sale of stakes, the billionaire has successfully generated significant value as most of the stocks had gained significantly amid the bull run in the market. The stock sale has also allowed the billionaire investor to raise the cash pile in his investment firm to a record $277 billion. Source: pexels Although Buffett has previously argued against diversification, it‚Äôs understandable why his firm decided to reduce stakes in some of the companies. The investments had been a huge success for his firm, locking profits with the overall market at all-time highs. The fact that Buffett invests through a conglomerate structure, often considered archaic, underscores his edge in the highly competitive investment world. At 94, the ‚ÄòOracle of Omaha‚Äô has started showing signs of slowing down. The appointment of Greg Abel as his successor signals he may not have a significant say in investment decisions in the near future. What might come as a surprise is that the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024 are not among the big names that account for the biggest share of Buffett‚Äôs portfolio. Instead, they are companies that have remained resilient amid the high interest rate environment that has rattled the stock market. Additionally, they boast of stocks well positioned to benefit as the macroeconomic environment improves, with the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points. The US economy is avoiding recession as the Fed continues to tweak its monetary policy, which should allow the companies to generate more shareholder value and, therefore, continue powering high. Buffett‚Äôs investment portfolio also includes companies with tremendous potential and ability to generate free cash flow owing to resilient core businesses. Consequently, the companies have emerged as a source of passive income, allowing Buffett to generate billions of dollars in dividends. Last year alone, the Oracle of Omaha raked $4.36 billion in dividends from his investments. Our Methodology We analyzed Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs Q2 2024 portfolio and picked the best-performing stocks on a year-to-date basis, as of September 20. The list is sorted in ascending order of the year-to-date performance of the stocks. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Warren Buffett‚Äôs Q2 2024 Stake: $10.38 Billion Year to Date Gain as of September 20: 28.36% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 59 Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024 in the financial service sector. It specializes in providing a range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in financial markets. It is one of the oldest holdings in Buffett‚Äôs portfolio and continues to generate significant value in share price gains and dividend offerings. Its competitive edge stems from operating two robust businesses. Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE:MCO) runs a business that evaluates the creditworthiness of different bond issuers, including companies and governments. It holds a significant market position, facing competition primarily from S&P Global and Fitch Ratings. Additionally, it has an analytics division that employs data to assess risk. Record-low interest rates have encouraged companies and government bodies to issue debt for over a decade. This has sustained the importance of Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE:MCO)‚Äôs core operating division. Booming businesses have seen the stock sentiments receive significant powering to record highs. Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has moved to strengthen its business empire and reach the market. The firm revealed its purchase of Praedicat, a company that focuses on analytics for the casualty insurance industry. This deal is anticipated to improve Moody‚Äôs data and analytical capabilities, especially in the areas of casualty and liability risk assessment, but it is not expected to affect Moody‚Äôs financial performance for the year 2024 significantly. The company delivered solid second-quarter results, with revenues increasing 22% to $1.8 billion. On the other hand, earnings came in at $600 million or $3.02 a share, up from $2.05 a share last year. Growth in the underlying core business and solid financial results is the catalyst behind the stock rallying by 28.36% and outperforming the 18% gain of the S&P 500. In Q2 2024, 59 out of the 912 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey purchased shares of the firm. The largest hedge fund investor in Moody‚Äôs Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway, which holds shares valued at $10.38 billion. Overall MCO ranks 10th on our list of 10 best performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again ‚Äî this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10.

September 26, 2024 08:30 ET | Source: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC September 26, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (‚ÄúBiodexa‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) Interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (Nasdaq: BDRX), an acquisition-focused clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs, today announces its unaudited interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 which will also be made available on the Company‚Äôs website at www.biodexapharma.com OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company announced the following in the six months ended June 30, 2024: Post period end: FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Post period end: Commenting, Stephen Stamp, CEO and CFO, said ‚ÄúIt was a busy first half for Biodexa. Licensing in eRapa, a Phase 3 ready asset with access to $17 million of non-dilutive grant funding, is an enormous step forward. The second half will be about executing on our lead programs. We already have approval from Health Canada for the IIT Phase 2a study of tolimidone in Type 1 diabetes and we are working diligently to set up a global Phase 3 registrational study of eRapa in FAP so we can begin recruiting early next year.‚Äù For more information, please contact: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Stephen Stamp, CEO, CFO Tel: +44 (0)29 2048 0180 www.biodexapharma.com About Biodexa Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (listed on NASDAQ: BDRX) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs. The Company‚Äôs lead development programs include eRapa, under development for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Non-Muscle Invasive Blader Cancer; tolimidone, under development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes; and MTX110, which is being studied in aggressive rare/orphan brain cancer indications. eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis. Tolimidone is an orally delivered, potent and selective activator of Lyn kinase. Lyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, in neural tissues, liver, and adipose tissue. Tolimidone demonstrates glycemic control via insulin sensitization in animal models of diabetes and has the potential to become a first in class blood glucose modulating agent. MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. Biodexa is supported by three proprietary drug delivery technologies focused on improving the bio-delivery and bio-distribution of medicines. Biodexa‚Äôs headquarters and R&D facility is in Cardiff, UK. For more information visit www.biodexapharma.com.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE‚ÄôS REVIEW Our primary focus in the first half of 2024 was on assimilating tolimidone, licensed in December 2023, into our portfolio and searching for additional clinical-stage assets to diversify and advance our pipeline which ultimately led to the licensing of eRapa in May 2024. eRapa License In line with our strategy to build a sustainable therapeutics company in rare/orphan diseases, we continue to search for opportunities to broaden and diversify our development pipeline. On April 25, 2024, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (‚ÄúLCA‚Äù) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa, an oral formulation of rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) for use in all diseases, states or conditions in humans. Under the LCA, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture, commercialize, or otherwise exploit products containing rapamycin. Pursuant to the terms of the LCA, the Company and Emtora established a joint development committee to monitor and progress the development of eRapa. Emtora has conducted a Phase 1 study of eRapa in prostate cancer, a Phase 2 study in FAP and has an ongoing Phase 2 study in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer. Preparations are under way for a registrational Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. In consideration for the license, we made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, we are also responsible for up to an aggregate $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, we are also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora‚Äôs legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favour of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven. We also made an additional $0.5 million payment which was used for a match to an advance from the CPRIT. Emtora had secured a grant of $17.0 million from CPRIT to support the Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. The grant requires a 1 for 2 match and Biodexa was expected to fund the match of up to $7.5 million, being 50% of the remaining CPRIT grant, which was completed in September 2024. Grant funding is available once the match payment has been certified and CPRIT has approved eligible trial expenses. In certain instances, CPRIT may advance payments before eligible trial expenses have been incurred. Upon a change of control of the Company, we will issue Emtora a warrant exercisable for 1,604,328 ADSs. The LCA also provides us with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ‚ÄúFDA‚Äù). R&D update Following the in-licensing of eRapa, our development pipeline has not only advanced in terms of clinical stage but expanded to six programmes overall, four of which are orphan indications: eRapa eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis1. Rapamycin is approved in the US for organ rejection in renal transplantation as Rapamune¬Æ(Pfizer). Through the use of nanotechnology and pH sensitive polymers, eRapa is designed to address the poor bioavailability, variable pharmacokinetics and toxicity generally associated with the currently available forms of rapamycin. eRapa is protected by a number of issued patents which extend through 2035, with other pending applications potentially providing further protection beyond 2035. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (‚ÄúFAP‚Äù) FAP is an orphan indication characterized by a proliferation of polyps in the colon and/or rectum, usually occurring in mid-teens. There is no approved therapeutic option for treating FAP patients, for whom active surveillance and surgical resection of the colon and/or rectum remain the standard of care. If untreated, FAP typically leads to cancer of the colon and/or rectum. There is a significant hereditary component to FAP with a reported incidence of one in 5,000 to 10,000 in the US1 and one in 11,300 to 37,600 in Europe2. eRapa has received Orphan Designation in the US with plans to seek such designation in Europe. Importantly, mTOR has been shown to be over-expressed in FAP polyps ‚Äì thereby underscoring the rationale for using a potent and safe mTOR inhibitor like eRapa to treat FAP. An open-label Phase 2 study (NCT04230499) was conducted by Emtora in seven U.S. centres of excellence in 30 adult patients. Patients were sequentially enrolled into three dosing cohorts of 10 patients each for a 12-month treatment period: 0.5mg every other day (Cohort 1), 0.5mg daily every other week (Cohort 2), and 0.5mg daily (Cohort 3). Upper and lower endoscopic surveillance occurred at baseline and after six months. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of eRapa and percentage change from baseline in polyp burden, as measured by the aggregate of all polyp diameters. In May 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at six months were presented at the prestigious 2024 Digestive Disease Week annual meeting in Washington D.C. by Carol Burke, MD, the Principal Investigator. In summary, at six months, eRapa appeared safe and well-tolerated with a significant 24% reduction in the total polyp burden at six months compared with baseline (p=0.04) and an overall 83% non-progression rate. In June 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at 12 months were presented at the bi-annual InSIGHT meeting in Barcelona by Dr Burke. Overall, 21 of 28 (75%) patients were deemed to be non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 17%. In Cohort 2, the likely dosage regimen for Phase 3, eight of nine (89)% of patients were deemed non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 29%. Over the course of 12 months, there were four related Grade 3 or higher and one related Serious Adverse Event reported during the trial and 95% compliance rate at 12 months. One patient was removed from the trial due to non-compliance. The Phase 3 registrational study is planned to be a double-blind placebo-controlled design recruiting approximately 150 high risk patients diagnosed with germline or phenotypic FAP. The primary clinical endpoint is expected to be the first progression free survival event which will comprise composite endpoints including major surgery. A ‚ÄòType C‚Äô meeting with the FDA is planned for 4Q24 to finalise the protocol and related matters. A $17 million grant from CPRIT will support this study. Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (‚ÄúNMIBC‚Äù) NMIBC refers to tumors found in the tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder. The most common treatment is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (‚ÄúBCG‚Äù) with chemotherapy depending upon assessment of risk of recurrence. NMIBC is the fourth most common cancer in men with an incidence of 10.1 per 100,000 and 2.5 per 100,000 in women3. Our ongoing multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in NMIBC is expected to enrol up to 166 patients with primary endpoints of safety/tolerability and relapse free survival after 12 months of treatment. The Phase 2 study, which is supported by a $3.0 million non-dilutive grant from the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, is expected to read out in mid-2025. MTD228 ‚Äì Tolimidone Tolimidone was originally discovered by Pfizer and was developed through Phase 2 for the treatment of gastric ulcers. Pfizer undertook a broad pre-clinical program to characterize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicology of tolimidone. Pfizer discontinued development of the drug due to lack of efficacy for that indication in a Phase II clinical trial. Tolimidone is a selective activator of the enzyme Lyn kinase which increases phosphorylation of insulin substrate-1, thereby amplifying the signalling cascade initiated by the binding of insulin to its receptor. Type 1 Diabetes (‚ÄúT1D‚Äù) Tolimidone‚Äôs potential utility in T1D has been demonstrated by several ground-breaking preclinical studies conducted by the University of Alberta, where Lyn kinase was identified as a key factor for beta cell survival and proliferation in in vitro and in vivo models. Most importantly, tolimidone was able to induce proliferation in beta cells isolated from human cadavers. From a mechanism of action perspective, tolimidone has been shown to both prevent beta cell degradation and to stimulate beta cell proliferation. In a meta analysis of 1,202 articles and 193 studies, the incidence of T1D was shown to be 15 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 9.5 per 10,000 of the population4. As a first step in the continued clinical development of tolimidone, a Phase 2a Investigator Initiated Trial (IIT) at the University of Alberta Diabetes Institute is designed to establish the minimum effective dose of tolimidone in patients with T1D. The study, which was approved by Health Canada in July 2024 is expected to recruit 12 patients initially across three dose groups. The study will measure C-peptide levels (a marker for insulin) and HbA1c (a marker for blood glucose) after three months compared with baseline and the number of hyperglycemic events. MTX110 MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the brain tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. All three types of brain cancer being studied are orphan. Recurrent Glioblastoma (‚ÄúrGBM‚Äù) Our Phase 1 MAGIC-G1 study (NCT05324501) of MTX110 in rGBM completed the dose escalation part of the study with the recruitment of the fourth patient in Cohort A. In February 2024 we announced Patient #1, who had received sub-optimal infusions of 60¬µM of MTX110 had survived for12 months from the start of treatment (OS=12). GBM universally recurs and once it does median overall survival according to a retrospective analysis of 299 patients reported in the Journal of Neuro-Oncology is 6.5 months. Post period end, we provided an update on the status of cohort A in the MAGIC-G1 study: patients #1 and #2 have deceased with overall survival (OS) since start of treatment of 12 months and 13 months, respectively. Patients #3 and #4 remain alive with progression free survival (PFS) since the start of treatment of 6 and 9 months, respectively and OS thus far of 12 and 11 months respectively. GBM virtually always recurs with median Progression Free Survival of 1.5‚Äì6.0 months and median Overall Survival of 2.0‚Äì9.0 months5. Diffuse Midline Glioma (‚ÄúDMG‚Äù) In February 2024 we announced headline data from a Phase 1 IIT study conducted by Columbia University in newly diagnosed patients with DMG. As this was the first ever study of repeated infusions to the pons via an implanted CED catheter, the primary objective of the study was safety and tolerability and, accordingly, the number of infusions was limited to two, each of 48 hours, 7 days apart in nine patients. One patient suffered a severe adverse event assessed by the investigators as not related to the study drug. Although not powered to reliably demonstrate efficacy, median overall survival (OS) of patients in the study was 16.5 months compared with median survival rate in a cohort of 316 cases of 10.0 months (Jansen et al, 2015. Neuro-Oncology 17(1):160-166). Study investigators subsequently presented the results of the trial at the 21st International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO 2024) in Philadelphia. Medulloblastoma An IIT Phase I study of MTX110 in medulloblastoma remains ongoing at the University of Texas. Financing As a pre-revenue biotech company, securing adequate finance to fund operations to an out-licensing and/or partnering event is a constant focus. On the back of the eRapa in-licensing and the subsequent announcement of positive 6-month and 12-month data of eRapa in FAP, we accomplished two financings; the first in May 2024 and the second post period end in July 2024. May 2024 Warrant Exercises On May 22, 2024, we raised $6.05 million of gross proceeds from the exercise of previously issued warrants following an agreement between the Company and several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Series E and/or Series F warrants for cash, we issued one replacement warrant for each Series E warrant exercised in the form of a Series G warrant, and one replacement warrant for each Series F warrant exercised in the form of a Series H warrant. The Series G and Series H warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $2.50 each. July 2024 Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement On July 22, 2024, we utilised our capacity under our Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, we issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 ADSs, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 ADSs. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. 1. https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/ 2. https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/733#:~:text=FAP%20has%20a%20birth%20incidence,colorectal%20cancer%20(CRC)%20cases. 3. Cassell et al., World J Oncol. 2019 Jun; 10(3): 123‚Äì131. 4. National Library of Medicine, Mobasseri et al., published online 2020 Mar 30. doi: 10.34172/hpp.2020.18 5. Birzu et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794906 1H24 FINANCIAL REVIEW The unaudited results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are discussed below: Key performance indicators (KPIs): Biodexa‚Äôs KPIs focus on the key areas of operating results, R&D spend and cash management. These measures provide information on the core R&D operations. Additional financial and non-financial KPIs may be adopted in due course. Revenues Total revenue for the six months to June 30, 2024 was ¬£Nil compared to ¬£0.30 million in the first six months of 2023. The R&D collaboration with Janssen, which represented the entire revenue in 1H23, concluded in September 2023. Research and Development R&D costs in 1H24 reduced by ¬£0.06 million, or 3%, to ¬£2.19 million compared with ¬£2.25 million in 1H23. The percentage of R&D costs as a percentage of total operating costs increased to 52% in the period from 50%. The reduction in R&D costs in 1H24 reflects a reduction in spend of ¬£0.54 million on the MAGIC-G1 study in rGBM, the termination of legacy drug delivery projects and lower personnel costs offset by the addition of MTD228 (tolimidone) and MTX230 (eRapa) for a combined expenditure of ¬£0.65 million in 1H24. Administrative Costs Administrative costs in 1H24 decreased by ¬£0.26 million, or 11% to ¬£2.03 million from ¬£2.29 million in 1H23. The decrease in administrative costs in 1H24 is a result of a positive reversal in foreign exchange of ¬£0.23 million and a reduction in professional fees of ¬£0.14 million offset by increases in share-based payment charge of ¬£0.12 million and sundry other costs. Finance Income and Expense Finance income in 1H24 and 1H23 included gains in respect of an equity settled derivative financial liability of ¬£0.75 million (1H23: ¬£0.39 million). The gains arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. In addition, the Company earned interest on cash deposits. Finance expense in the period related to lease liabilities and discounted interest on deferred consideration. Cash Flows Cash outflows from operating activities in 1H24 were ¬£4.81 million compared to ¬£3.88 million in 1H23, driven by a net loss of ¬£3.31 million (1H23: ¬£3.57 million) and after negative working capital of ¬£0.87 million (1H23: positive ¬£0.21 million) and other negative non-cash items totalling ¬£0.63 million (1H23: negative ¬£0.52 million). Net cash used in investing activities in 1H24 of ¬£0.75 million in 1H24 resulted from the purchase of eRapa licence for total consideration of ¬£3.07 million including cash consideration of ¬£0.85 million (1H23: ¬£Nil) offset by ¬£0.10 million of interest received (1H23: ¬£0.02 million). Net cash generated in financing activities in 1H24 was ¬£4.65 million (1H23: inflow ¬£6.25 million), which was driven by receipts from share issuances, including warrants, net of costs of ¬£4.74 million offset by payments on lease liabilities of ¬£0.09 million. Overall, cash decreased by ¬£0.92 million in 1H24 compared to an increase of ¬£2.39 million in 1H23. This resulted in a cash balance at June 30, 2024 of ¬£5.06 million compared with ¬£5.23 million at June 30, 2023 and ¬£5.97 million at December 31, 2023. Going concern Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio. For the six months to June 30, 2024, the Group incurred a consolidated loss from operations of ¬£3.31 million (1H23: ¬£3.57 million) and negative cash flows from operating activities of ¬£4.81 million (1H23: ¬£3.88 million). As of June 30, 2024, the Group had accumulated deficit of ¬£147.88 million. The Group‚Äôs future viability is dependent on its ability to raise cash from financing activities to finance its development plans until commercialisation, generate cash from operating activities and to successfully obtain regulatory approval to allow marketing of its development products. The Group‚Äôs failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. The Group's consolidated interim financial information has been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2024, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of ¬£5.06 million. The Directors forecast that the Group currently has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. If the Company does not secure additional funding before the first quarter of 2025, it will no longer be a going concern and would likely be placed in Administration. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the Group for the next three years including the period 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information. These forecasts show that further financing will be required before the first quarter of 2025 assuming, inter alia, that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares (including the ADSs) and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. On August 27, 2024, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC advising that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid requirement set forth in NASDAQ‚Äôs rules for continued listing of its securities. The Company has requested a Hearing Panel which has paused any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. If the Company's ADSs are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company's ADSs or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company's ADSs could suffer a material decline. Delisting may impair the Company's ability to raise capital. In the Directors‚Äô opinion, the environment for financing of small and micro-cap biotech companies continues to be challenging. While this may present acquisition and/or merger opportunities with other companies with limited or no access to financing, as noted above, any attendant financings by Biodexa are likely to be dilutive. The Directors continue to evaluate financing options, including those connected to acquisitions and/or mergers, potentially available to the Group. Any alternatives considered are contingent upon the agreement of counterparties and accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of alternative courses of action to finance the Group would be successful. This requirement for additional financing in the short term represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern. Should it become evident in the future that there are no realistic financing options available to the Group which are actionable before its cash resources run out then the Group will no longer be a going concern. In such circumstances, we would no longer be able to prepare financial statements under paragraph 25 of IAS 1. Instead, the financial statements would be prepared on a liquidation basis and assets would be stated at net realizable value and all liabilities would be accelerated to current liabilities. The Directors believe there are adequate options and time available to secure additional financing for the Group and after considering the uncertainties, the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of clinical trials. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we lack sufficient capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The LCA entered into with Emtora meets the definition of a Joint Arrangement under IFRS 11, specifically related to the FAP program. A jointly controlled escrow account was established on completion of the LCA. All FAP program transactions are processed through the escrow account, including the Company‚Äôs deposits of matching funds, as set out in the agreement, the receipt of grant funding from CPRIT and the payment of eligible R&D expenses. Although the CPRIT grant and R&D supplier contracts are with Emtora, the joint arrangement nature of the LCA results in Emtora being deemed to be acting as the Company‚Äôs agent. Accordingly, the Company recognises 100% of the grant and 100% of the R&D expenditure. The CPRIT grant recognised is on a 1 for 2 match. In accordance with the Company‚Äôs accounting policy, the grant, as it is the re-imbursement of directly related costs, is credited to R&D costs in the same period in The Statements of Comprehensive Income. The escrow account is recognised within prepayments, CPRIT grant received in advance is recognised within deferred revenue and any grant not yet received is recognised in accrued income. In 1H24 the company recognised R&D costs of ¬£0.2 million on the FAP project, this was made up of expenditure of ¬£0.5 million netted against CPRIT grant of ¬£0.3 million. The balances as at June 30, 2024 were as follows in relation to the FAP project: Prepayments ¬£1.2 million Deferred revenue ¬£0.1 million The gain on the equity settled derivative financial liability in 1H24 and 1H23 arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. Income tax is recognised or provided at amounts expected to be recovered or to be paid using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Group Statement of Financial Position date. Research and development tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis and are included as an income tax credit under current assets. The research and development tax credit recognised is based on management‚Äôs estimate of the expected tax claim for the period and is recorded within taxation under the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Scheme. Basic loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net loss for the period from continuing operations, attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As the Group made a loss for the period the diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share. The Company has considered the guidance set out in IAS 33 in calculating the denominator in connection with the issuance of Pre-Funded, Abeyance Shares, Series A, Series B and Series C warrants as disclosed in note 8. Management have recognised the warrants from the date of grant rather than the date of issue of the corresponding Ordinary Shares when calculating the denominator. The Group has made a loss in the current and previous periods presented, and therefore the options and warrants are anti-dilutive. As a result, diluted earnings per share is presented on the same basis as basic earnings per share. The individual intangible assets which are material to the financial statements are as follows: *asset is not yet in use and has not started amortising On April 25, 2024 the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (LCA) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa. In consideration for the License, the Company made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favor of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven and certain historical liabilities relating to their on-going FAP and NMIBC programs were settled. The Company is also obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. In addition, the Company is also responsible for up to $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets, with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, the Company is also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora‚Äôs legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. The LCA also provides the Company with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ‚ÄúFDA‚Äù). If the Company does not exercise the option, it would be required to make additional quarterly payments, as disclosed in note 7, until the first commercial sale of the product. The Company is obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. This financial liability is measured on Level 3, the fair value is derived using a discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate applied to the obligation was 11.64% (2023: n/a). A 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the liability by approximately ¬£0.03 million (2023: n/a) and ¬£0.03 million (2023: n/a), respectively. An increase in the liability would result in a loss in the revaluation of financial instruments, while a decrease would result in a gain. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. Equity settled derivative financial liability is a liability that is not to be settled for cash. No warrants recognised as equity settled derivatives were exercised in 2023. The Company issues warrants exercisable into ADSs of the Company as part of registered direct offerings and private placements in the US. The number of ADSs to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise price is denominated in US Dollars being different to the functional currency of the Company. Therefore, the warrants are classified as equity settled derivative financial liabilities recognised at fair value through the profit and loss account (‚ÄòFVTPL‚Äô). The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes model. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‚Äòfinance income‚Äô or ‚Äòfinance expense‚Äô lines item in the income statement. A key input in the valuation of the instrument is the Company share price. Details of the warrants are as follows: May 2024 warrants In May 2024 the Company issued 2,359,012 Series G ADS Warrants and 3,695,218 Series H ADS Warrants as part of the Warrant Inducement Transaction. The exercise price per ADS is $2.50. December 2023 warrants In December 2023 the Company issued 3,000,063 Series E ADS Warrants and 3,000,063 Series F ADS Warrants as part of the Registered Offering in the US. The exercise price per ADS is $2.20. May 2023 warrants In June 2023 the Company issued 276,689 Series D ADS Warrants as part of a registered direct offering and private placement in the US after securing shareholder approval. The exercise price per ADS was $16.00. May 2020 warrants In May 2020 the Company issued 838 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. October 2019 warrants In October 2019 the Company issued 392 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. Warrant re-price On May 22, 2024 the Company entered into agreements with several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants, issued in December 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. Warrants and Dara share options The Group also assumed fully vested warrants and share options on the acquisition of DARA Biosciences, Inc. (which took place in 2015). The number of ordinary shares to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise prices are denominated in US Dollars. The warrants are classified equity settled derivative financial liabilities and accounted for in the same way as those detailed above. The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The exercise price of the outstanding options is $1,903.40. The following table details the outstanding warrants and options over ADSs and ordinary shares recognised as equity settled derivative financial liabilities as at June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and also the movement in the year: Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The fair value of the Group‚Äôs derivative financial liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following table gives information about how the fair value of this financial liability is determined. Changing the unobservable risk-free rate input to the valuation model by 10% higher while all other variables were held constant, would not impact the carrying amount of shares (2023: nil). There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. The financial liability measured at fair value on Level 3 fair value measurement represents consideration relating to warrants issued in May 2024, December 2023, June 2023, May 2020 and October 2019 as part of Private Placements, Registered Direct offerings and the Warrant Inducement Transaction. During the period the Company issued the following warrants over ADSs, and these were recognised in the warrant reserve until exercise: The Series A, Series B and Series C warrants are exercisable on an ‚Äòalternative cashless basis‚Äô effectively allowing the holders to exercise for nil consideration. Ordinary and deferred shares were recorded as equity. The Directors consider there to be no related party transactions during the periods reported other than Directors Remuneration. The Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Bioasis on December 13, 2022 as amended on December 18, 2022. Under the agreement the Company agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Bioasis for consideration of, in aggregate, approximately C$7.4 million (c¬£4.4 million). The agreement was subject to shareholder approval. On January 23, 2023 at the General Meeting to approve the Arrangement Agreement none of the special resolutions were passed and, accordingly, the acquisition of Bioasis did not proceed. Under the agreement the Company agreed to reimburse Bioasis US$225,000 for expenses relating to the transaction should the Company‚Äôs shareholders not approve the transaction. On March 3, 2023 the Company advised Bioasis that it would offset this liability against the $500,000 loan it advanced to them during December 2022 and January 2023. As at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had a contingent liability of $225,000 in relation to this potential liability. On July 22, 2024, the Company utilised its capacity under its Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, the Company issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 Depositary Shares, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 Depositary Shares. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. On August 27,2024, the Company , received a Staff Determination letter (the ‚ÄúLetter‚Äù) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (‚ÄúNasdaq‚Äù) notifying the Company of the Staff‚Äôs determination to delist the Company‚Äôs securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market because the Company‚Äôs securities have had a closing bid price below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, which triggers a notice of delisting pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúRule‚Äù). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Rule. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. Accordingly, and as described in the Letter, unless the Company timely requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the ‚ÄúPanel‚Äù), the Company‚Äôs securities would be subject to suspension/delisting. Accordingly, the Company requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. On September 19, 2024, the Company announced a ratio change on its ADSs from one (1) ADS representing four hundred (400) ordinary shares, to the new ratio of one (1) ADS representing ten thousand (10,000) ordinary shares (the "Ratio Change"). The effective date of the Ratio Change is expected to be October 4,2024. vv Attachment

Title: Elon Musk is $100 billion richer than in April thanks to Tesla's stock surge ‚Äî and worth more than McDonald's or Pepsi

Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune ‚Äî worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures‚Äîespecially the tech-dominated Nasdaq‚Äîare rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

William R. Keating, the congress member representing Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, recently made several transactions from his Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as per the latest congressional trade report. Among the most notable transactions, Keating sold a portion of his holdings in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Inc. Common Stock (NYSE:CAT) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) N.V. - Common Stock (NASDAQ:NXPI). Both transactions were valued between $1,001 and $15,000. In addition to the above, Keating also partially sold his holdings in several corporate securities, including those from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Elevance Health Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, T-Mobile USA Inc, Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP), and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). Each of these transactions was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Interestingly, two transactions stood out with a higher value. Keating partially sold his holdings in a Comcast Corp note, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Furthermore, he sold his United States Treasury Series C-2032 note, also valued between $15,001 and $50,000. All transactions were conducted on September 11, 2024, and were reported on September 23, 2024. These trades, as per the report, were made from Keating's IRA, an investment vehicle commonly used by individuals to earmark funds for retirement savings. As investors keep a keen eye on the financial activities of influential figures like congress members, these transactions by Keating provide useful insights. However, as always, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and consider various factors before making investment decisions. As William R. Keating adjusts his investment portfolio, it's worth noting the recent performance and outlook of Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT), one of the stocks he has sold. According to InvestingPro data, Caterpillar has a robust market capitalization of $183.7 billion and has been demonstrating financial resilience. The company's P/E ratio stands at 17.2, reflecting a valuation that is attractive relative to near-term earnings growth, an observation that aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in the context of its earnings growth. Investors tracking dividend reliability will find Caterpillar's dividend history compelling, as the company has not only maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years but has also raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years. This consistency in rewarding shareholders is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to its investors, a point that is underscored by two separate InvestingPro Tips. For those looking at stock performance, Caterpillar has delivered a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 16.0%. This robust short-term performance is part of a longer trend, as the company has also enjoyed a high return over the last decade. Caterpillar's operational strength is further reflected in its gross profit margin of 32.72% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating a healthy ability to manage costs and sustain profitability. For investors interested in a deeper dive into Caterpillar's financials and performance metrics, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights.

On Thursday, JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating and NT$1,200.00 price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (2330:TT) (NYSE:TSM), citing expectations for a robust third-quarter earnings report. The firm anticipates that TSMC's revenue will slightly exceed the upper end of the company's forecast, with projected revenues of US $23.3 billion against guidance of US$22.4-23.2 billion. Gross margins (GMs) are also expected to be at the high end of TSMC's forecast, with an estimate of 54.8% compared to the projected range of 53.5-55.5%. The positive outlook is partly attributed to the strong growth in the N3 technology node, which is used for the latest iPhone builds and new application processors from companies like Mediatek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Additionally, the N4 node, primarily utilized for AI accelerators, is expected to contribute to the company's revenue growth. JPMorgan forecasts a quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of approximately 10% for the fourth quarter of 2024 due to these factors. JPMorgan also anticipates that TSMC will continue to communicate strong demand trends for its N3 technology and a persistent supply-demand gap for advanced packaging solutions, particularly the Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) technology. The firm's outlook is bolstered by the expectation that 2025 will be a strong year for TSMC. This optimism is based on the sustained demand for AI accelerators, the expansion of N3 engagements beyond Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and an anticipated uptick in gross margins due to improved yields and potential price increases for the N3E technology node. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) has reported significant growth in its second quarter of 2024, with a sequential revenue increase of 13.6% in NT dollars and 10.3% in USD. The company's gross margin rose to 53.2%, and its operating margin reached 42.5%. TSMC's High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for more than half of the total revenue for the first time, standing at 52%. The company revised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. BofA Securities maintained a positive outlook on TSMC, reiterating a Buy rating. The firm highlighted the upcoming delivery of a high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool to TSMC from ASML (AS:ASML), which is expected to enhance the company's capabilities in developing advanced semiconductor processes. TSMC's August financial report showed a revenue of NT$251 billion, a 2% decrease month-over-month but a 33% increase year-over-year. Bernstein SocGen Group updated its outlook on TSMC, increasing the price target to $220 from the previous $200, and retaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm suggests TSMC is well-positioned to perform better than its peers should a recession occur, due to its advanced technologies and market share gains. Finally, TSMC's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. As Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approaches its next earnings date on October 17, 2024, the company's financial health and market performance remain a focal point for investors. With a market capitalization of $803.45 billion and a P/E ratio of 27.72, TSMC stands as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. In the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, TSMC has reported a revenue growth of 9.44%, showcasing its ability to expand amidst a dynamic tech landscape. This is further evidenced by a substantial quarterly revenue growth of 40.07% in Q2 2024, highlighting the company's strong performance in the short term. InvestingPro Tips suggest that TSMC's robust gross profit margin of 53.36% aligns with JPMorgan's expectations of high-end gross margins for the company. Additionally, with a dividend growth of 42.6% in the same period, TSMC demonstrates its commitment to returning value to shareholders. It's worth noting that the InvestingPro product lists 15 additional tips that can provide deeper insights into TSM's financial health and investment potential. Investors may also find TSMC's price resilience of interest, with the stock trading at 94.25% of its 52-week high. This, combined with a year-to-date price total return of 76.84%, positions TSMC favorably in the eyes of growth-oriented investors. The company's fair value, as assessed by analysts, stands at $214, while InvestingPro's fair value estimation is at $161.5, offering a perspective on the stock's potential undervaluation or overvaluation.

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as Stock Sets Record High

Time Published: 2024-09-26T02:06:11Z

Meta Platforms (META) shares will likely remain in focus for the remainder of the week after the tech titan‚Äôs stock set a record high on Wednesday and the company kicked off its annual Connect conference. The company unveiled a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new artificial intelligence (AI) features, and other tech gadgets at the highly anticipated event. The Facebook and Instagram parent has also turned to celebrities, announcing deals with actors Awkwafina, John Cena, and Judi Dench, among others, that will allow the company to use their voices in a new AI assistant. Since the start of the year, Meta‚Äôs stock has gained around 60% through Wednesday‚Äôs close as the social media company's latest quarterly results indicate that significant investments in AI infrastructure and product innovations have started to translate into higher advertising revenue and earnings. Meta shares gained 0.9% on Wednesday to finish at $568.31, after surging to an all-time high of $576.88 during the session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta‚Äôs chart and identify important price levels to watch out for. Meta shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle on above-average volume earlier this month, with the stock price continuing to track higher into its Connect 2024 conference. The stock‚Äôs breakout coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving into overbought territory to confirm bullish price momentum but also caution of short-term stretched conditions. To forecast potential price targets above the stock‚Äôs all-time high (ATH), investors can use the measuring principle and a more subjective bars pattern. Let‚Äôs look at each in further detail. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance of the ascending triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern‚Äôs top trendline. For instance, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts an upside target in the stock at $700. Speculating an upside target using a bars pattern works by using a prior trending move to forecast a potential future move, assuming price action tends to rhyme. In this case, we extract the stock‚Äôs trend higher from December to March and reposition it from this month‚Äôs low, which projects a price target of around $790. We selected this prior move because it commenced from an earlier ascending triangle‚Äôs lower trendline on Meta‚Äôs chart, similar to the stock‚Äôs price action from the most recent ascending triangle. Given the RSI indicator points to overbought conditions in the stock, investors should also keep a close eye on the $535 level, an area on the chart where prior resistance could become future support near the ascending triangle's upper trendline. Market participants who prefer to trade pullbacks rather than chase breakouts could look for buying opportunities near this area.

(NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike‚Äôs main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike‚Äôs customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike‚Äôs stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.

While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company‚Äôs restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (‚ÄúTSI‚Äù) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and ‚Äúunleash [its] true earnings power.‚Äù In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its ‚Äúcost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.‚Äù These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC‚Äôs CEO admitted that ‚Äúthe previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth‚Äù because the systems that were acquired over time were ‚Äúnever integrated, never deduped,‚Äù and admitted that the Company was ‚Äúnot [a] fully functional organization.‚Äù DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share.

(NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below‚Äôs financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below‚Äôs statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, ‚ÄúNet sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.‚Äù At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, ‚ÄúNet sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.‚Äù When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
