As artificial intelligence becomes the corporate buzzword du jour, executives are finding more and more ways to shoehorn the trendy tech into their everyday business operations. That has a lot of workers anxious about automation, income inequality, and increased workloads — something c-suite bigwigs are all too happy to take advantage of. Though AI — really just a fun name for large language models (LLMs), or predictive chatbots — in its current state isn't likely to bring a labor revolution anytime soon, CEOs find that the threat of AI automation works just as well. As Axios highlighted this week, CEOs are increasingly using AI adoption as a cudgel to justify layoffs, or to manufacture consent for layoffs in the future. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, recently said AI is likely to "reduce our total corporate workforce," while JPMorgan executives told investors that AI will allow for a "10 percent headcount reduction." Others, like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, are threatening workers directly, saying that AI is now the "baseline expectation." Per Axios, Shopify managers hiring human workers now have to explain to top brass why AI wouldn't be a better choice for any given job. This kind of doomsday messaging goes hand in hand with increased expectations for workers' productivity. A recent survey found that 77 percent of workers reported that AI adds to their workload. Of that, a staggering proportion — 39 percent — involves fixing the buggy tech's sloppy mistakes. While AI is a pretty recent phenomenon, these kinds of scare tactics aren't new. "Disciplining labor" is a concept that occasionally gets thrown around discussions of supply side economics. It's a term used to describe broad economic measures that keep workers in line, in order to keep corporate profits high — suppressing unions, keeping wage growth low, and dangling the threat of unemployment over their heads. In this sense, AI in its current form is simply a new whip for CEOs to use on their employees. It's having what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, calls an "inculcation effect" on workers. It's a "warning with an anticipatory alert that preempts later trauma going viral," he told Axios. Plus, now that the job market has been devastated by AI spambots, finding a new gig is harder than ever. With AI, workers are forced onto their back foot as their corporate overlords demand more productivity for less pay. If the choice is to either work harder or clear out their desk, employees are then less likely to ask for quality of life improvements, or to organize for unions that could win them. And that, of course, means corporate honchos get an even bigger piece of the pie.

Title: Watch These Visa Price Levels as Stablecoins Threaten to Bypass Card Fees

Visa (V) shares slid this week after the Senate on Tuesday passed the GENIUS Act, providing a regulatory framework for companies issuing stablecoins. The crypto-friendly legislation could open the door for merchants to bypass card-based payment systems offed by Visa and other payments providers. Reports surfaced last week that Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) were looking into launching their own stablecoins, a move that could potentially eat away at the billions of dollars the retail titans pay in credit transaction fees. Shares of Visa were little changed in Friday afternoon trading, just above $338, leaving them down about 4% for the week. Still, they've gained roughly 7% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500, which added less than 2% over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at Visa’s chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Earlier this month, the stock climbed above its prominent March and May peaks, before staging a sharp reversal to form a bull trap, a trading event that lures investors to buy upon a breach of major resistance—the two peaks in this case—before the price makes a sudden move lower. As recent peaks on the chart made higher highs, the relative strength index (RSI) made comparatively shallower peaks to create a bearish divergence and indicate waning buying momentum. The stock closed decisively below the respected 50-day moving average (MA) in Wednesday’s trading session, possibly paving the way for further selling. The first support level to watch sits around $328. A retracement to this area may attract buying interest near the March swing low, which currently lies just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. A more significant drop could see the shares revisit lower support near $302. Investors may look for entry points in this region around the stock’s April sell-off low and last November’s breakaway gap. During upswings in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $350 level. The shares may face overhead selling pressure in this area near the rising 50-day MA, which currently sits alongside the late March peak and minor February trough. Buying above this level could fuel a move toward $367. Investors who have bought Visa shares at lower prices may look for exit points in this location near the March and May peaks. This level sits in the same neighborhood as a projected downside target that takes the stock’s move lower from March to April and repositions it from the May high, potentially providing clues as to how a new downtrend may play out.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization Hits $24 Billion As Wall Street Bets Big

ByAnastasia Chernikova ByAnastasia Chernikova, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during afternoon trading ... More on April 9, 2025 in New York. Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 7.9 percent to 40,608.45, the broad-based S&P 500 Index rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.90, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped more than 12.2 percent to 17,124.97. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Major financial institutions are racing to tokenize everything from U.S. Treasuries to real estate, but how long will it last? The tokenization revolution is accelerating at breakneck speed with the Senate just passing the GENIUS Act, providing the first federal framework for digital assets that Wall Street had been waiting for. Over 185 crypto tokens are classified as Real-World Assets (RWAs) with their market capitalization over $10.62 billion, a 61% increase from the previous month, according to Tangem. On top of that, the total market value of tokenized RWAs on public blockchains had surged to nearly $18 billion by early 2025, up from about $10 billion just a year before. This unprecedented growth has been driven by institutional adoption that's finally materializing. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund now holds $2.9 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the world’s largest tokenized asset fund. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI follows at $776 million, while VanEck launched its tokenized RWA fund called VBILL, offering exposure to US Treasury bills across multiple blockchains in partnership with Securitize. “BlackRock tokenized a money market fund on Ethereum. Franklin Templeton is running US government bond funds on public blockchains. JPMorgan just ran a cross chain Delivery versus Payment pilot with Chainlink and Ondo. These are not retail projects. These are the most conservative institutions in finance validating a new model,” Mitchell DiRaimondo, founder at Steelwave Digital, told me in a written response. The current market shows $24 billion in total tokenized assets across 194 issuers, with over 205,000 asset holders, indicating steady growth despite market volatility. Tokenization strips away the friction that has plagued traditional asset management for decades. Settlement times drop from days to minutes, previously illiquid assets like real estate can be traded 24/7, and compliance becomes programmable rather than paper-based. “The biggest risk today is assuming that a legal wrapper and a blockchain alone create value,” Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, told me. "Without real composability, reliable secondary markets, and trusted custody, tokenized assets remain stuck in marketing decks rather than investment portfolios." Ethereum still dominates the tokenized asset landscape, hosting the majority of Real-World Asset value. But emerging Layer 2 solutions are gaining ground as institutions seek faster, cheaper transactions. The infrastructure buildout extends beyond blockchain networks. Zero-knowledge proofs are enabling privacy-preserving compliance, allowing banks to prove asset backing without revealing sensitive financial information. Cross-chain interoperability solutions are connecting fragmented tokenized asset markets. "The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs—which make it possible to securely verify that RWAs are backed by real world assets, without revealing sensitive information—has been a huge catalyst for RWAs," Maxim Legg, CEO of The Pangea Foundation, told me in a written response. "Banks are able to prove that their tokenized funds are backed by real assets, without disclosing sensitive financial information." “It’s a structural evolution in how private credit and fixed income funds operate,” David Robnett, Managing Director of Asset Token Ventures, told me in a written response. “Tokenization solves real-world inefficiencies, such as post-trade friction, tax drag, and illiquidity. That makes growth not just sustainable, but inevitable.” Unlike the speculative crypto cycles of previous years, RWA tokens offer something fundamentally different: real yield backed by real assets. Tokenized Treasury bills currently yield 4-5%, while private credit tokens can offer 8-10% returns—comparable to traditional alternatives but with blockchain’s added benefits. “Unlike the NFT bubble, where speculative JPEGs dominated and predictably lost value, NFT 2.0, AKA Tokenized RWAs, are grounded in utility,” Dan Silverman, CEO at Balcony Technology, told me in an interview. "The RWA is worth what the underlying asset is worth, eliminating the volatility of speculative hype." While stablecoins, tokenized fiat currencies representing over $240 billion of the RWA market, have paved the way, the focus is now shifting to higher-yielding tokenized assets. The GENIUS Act’s framework creates the regulatory foundation for the broader RWA expansion. Here is the sector breakdown: U.S. Treasuries: $6.2 billion (led by BlackRock’s BUIDL at $2.5 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI at $776 million) Private Credit: $12.9 billion (platforms like Centrifuge, Maple, and Apollo's new tokenized fund) Commodities: $1.4 billion (primarily tokenized gold through Tether Gold and Paxos Gold) Real Estate: Growing rapidly, with about $3.8 billion in tokenized properties "Real-World Asset is real and sustainable. It's likely to go in waves," Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at Ernst & Young, told me in an interview. "We are going to move towards a second wave of real-world assets like real estate, physical infrastructure, intellectual property, and more that exist off-chain but could benefit from the automation possible with smart contracts and in the efficiency of on-chain settlement." Regulatory clarity and guidelines for tokenized assets remain critical for their future development. Infrastructure scaling with cross-chain interoperability solutions and institutional-grade custody services are also maturing rapidly. The RWA market is projected to hit a $50 billion market cap by the end of this year. For investors, this represents both opportunity and risk, but the institutional validation is real—BlackRock doesn't deploy billions into experimental technologies. "The promise of RWAs is to deliver the efficiency and immediacy of crypto markets to a wider investor pool," Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena, wrote to me in a response. "We’re not trying to tear down the financial system. We’re upgrading it." The smart money is actively participating, with careful due diligence and risk management. Whether this marks the dawn of a new financial era will depend on execution.

Title: Crypto stocks soar after Senate passes stablecoin bill, Circle up over 50%

Catherine McGrath is a crypto fellow at Fortune. Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week. Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday. The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions. Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night. “History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote. The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry. Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies. With support from the U.S. president and increasing regulatory clarity, mainstream corporations are considering implementing them into their payment structures, including Meta, Google, AirBnB and X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Andy Jassy says AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce but at least he’s honest about it

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the quiet part out loud this week, predicting AI will reduce its workforce. At least he’s honest about it, even if he trotted out the “free up workers for higher-value work” cliche. Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its staff too, no doubt for partly the same reason. Can Mark Zuckerberg vault Meta into the top tier of AI providers via acquihire? He sure seems to be trying. Meantime, Google kept up its recent stream of new models coming with an entry-level edition, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite. Continuing a recent series of Silicon Valley tech companies chasing the opportunity in government technology, OpenAI won a hefty defense contract. Speaking of big money in AI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab reportedly raised $2 billion on a $10 billion valuation. And in late-breaking news, Apple reportedly has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity. Two enterprise tech stalwarts attempted to position themselves to take advantage of customers’ focus on AI and data and the evolving mix of public and private cloud services needed for that. For one, Broadcom announced the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the latest iteration of its private cloud platform. Pure Storage also introduced its Enterprise Data Cloud, a rethink of enterprise storage aimed at recasting itself not just as a storage vendor but as a platform for autonomous data operations. At its re:Inforce conference this week, Amazon Web Services issued a raft of new features all aimed at making cybersecurity simpler, led by a preview release of a new version of AWS Security Hub. Texas Instruments joined the pack of chipmakers promising to build much more domestic factory capacity, saying it will invest $60 billion in U.S. fabs, though the time frame is not clear. Meanwhile, the Intel shakeup continued with several new executives … and several thousand fewer factory workers. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Must-read for anyone wondering what’s next for data and data platforms: Ali Ghodsi’s data intelligence playbook: Turning data into agentic advantage The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims joins others on cautioning against assuming AGI is around the corner: Why superintelligent AI isn’t taking over anytime soon Maybe a good thing given the dangers even OpenAI admits: OpenAI exec warns of growing risk that AI could aid in biological weapons development Moreover, it appears that ChatGPT isn’t so great for learning, at least initially: Study finds that LLM use leads to ‘likely decrease’ in learning skills Meanwhile, on the job front: Andy Jassy says generative AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years He even used the canonical argument that these agents will free up human staff to take on more creative roles. But since Jassy is saying Amazon will have fewer employees as a result of AI, it appears that some will have to find those creative roles somewhere else.

Title: Top takeaways from BI's conversations with real-estate investors

Time Published: 2025-06-20T13:16:34Z

Happy Friday! It's not goodbye. It's see you later. I start the second half of my paternity leave next week. I'll be out for the summer, but you're in good hands with my UK colleague Hallam Bullock. Just try not to give him too much grief on July 4. In today's big story, some advice for people looking to get their real-estate empire off the ground. What's on deck Markets: Why understanding Goldman Sachs' "coffee culture" is so important for interns. Tech: How Gen Z is getting around the brutal market for entry-level jobs in the tech industry. Business: It turns out that Target's loss is Walmart's gain when it comes to wealthier customers. But first, location, location, location. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. On the path to financial freedom, real-estate investing is typically a key stop. The stock market or e-commerce side hustles can be popular options, but collecting investment properties is often viewed as the Holy Grail of setting yourself up financially. But real-estate investing doesn't come easy … or cheap. There's also plenty of risk when taking on so much debt. Lucky for you, BI's Kathleen Elkins has written extensively about people who have set up real-estate empires. That includes a couple who built a portfolio of over 100 units and now work part time and travel half the year. It might sound a world away from someone just starting out, but it didn't happen overnight. When they started scooping up investment properties, Letizia Alto and Kenji Asakura didn't even own a primary residence. They shared six main pieces of advice they always follow when trying to make money in real estate. Here are some more takeaways from Kathleen's conversations with real-estate investors: It's not just for people with deep pockets: High upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, potential renovations) can be a big deterrent for hopeful real-estate investors. But a little can sometimes go a long way. A former firefighter went from earning $1,600 a month to owning over 30 properties. He spoke to Kathleen about how he got creative to land a $3 million deal with just $30,000 in savings. Do your homework: Real estate's biggest challenge can be figuring out where you want to buy something. A 32-year-old who retired early thanks to his real-estate investments shared the two software tools he swears by to find markets to buy in and price rentals appropriately. Another investor said this business book helped shape his investing strategy. The beauty of being stuck in the middle: When you think of real estate, you might immediately gravitate to vacation-style properties or long-term rentals. However, some investors see the most value in mid-term rentals. Don't forget about taxes: Generating income from multiple properties complicates how you file your taxes. But as the aforementioned Asakura put it to Kathleen, "The tax code is essentially a series of incentives to encourage certain behavior that the government wants." Here's how they get the most out of their investments from a tax perspective. 1. An intern's guide to succeeding on Wall Street. If you're one of the lucky interns in Goldman Sachs' summer class, take full advantage of the company's coffee culture to build connections. And if you're over at Blackstone, CEO Steve Schwarzman thinks you should embrace the change. 2. Citi gets an AI level-up. The bank's trio of AI strategy leaders gave an inkling of what's to come in a memo seen by BI. It's scaling AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with its tools. Read more about the strategy. 3. Don't overpay for your Aperol spritzes this summer. The value of the US dollar has dropped amid trade war and deficit concerns. That means unfavorable exchange rates and transaction fees can jack up costs when traveling abroad. Here are some ways to avoid excess charges overseas. 1. Is AI rejecting your job application? As companies turn to AI to boost productivity, BI has spoken to many frustrated job seekers who wonder if humans are even reviewing their applications. BI reached out to seven companies, from Kraft Heinz to Google, to find out what role AI plays in their hiring process. Spoiler: their answers varied. 2. Harvey and LexisNexis hard-launched. AI legal-tech darling Harvey is partnering with LexisNexis to let users access the vast legal database within Harvey's app. The move strengthens Harvey's claim as the go-to legal software provider as its rivals make gains. 3. How young techies cope with the industry's hiring downturn. Gen Z is staying optimistic about tech jobs, though many have had to lower their expectations and take what they can get. Layoffs, getting ghosted by potential employers, and dealing with the threat of AI are just part of the process. 1. Wait, is Walmart cool now? Clothing sales are up 23% at the retail giant this year, and shoppers are sharing "haul" videos online, impressed by its surprisingly trendy finds. BI's Katie Notopoulos found Walmart is attracting wealthier customers overall and picking up some Target defectors. 2. Efficiency secrets of the Wall Street elite. Leaders in the hot, high-growth secondaries industry are busier than ever. Fourteen industry power players told BI their top efficiency tips, from fake calendar blocks to just saying "no." 3. Peyton Manning goes from signal caller to shot-caller. Manning's Omaha Productions is looking to move its content off the field. He recently spoke with BI about his production company's success and said there's no one-size-fits-all definition of an Omaha show. Not every pro athlete reaches Manning's roaring financial success, though. Kroger reports earnings. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

June 20, 2025 09:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Why Elon Musk’s US$34 billion loss wasn’t really that – and what it tells us about the philanthropy of the ultra-wealthy

Professor of Management, University of St Andrews Tobias Jung does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. University of St Andrews provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Following a sharp drop in Tesla’s share price, outlets reported that the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, had “lost” US$34 billion (£25 billion) in a single day. That figure exceeds the annual GDP of countries like Iceland, Jamaica or Mauritius. Gaining or losing even 0.001% of that wealth would be life-changing for most people. But, this “loss” is entirely nominal. A decline in share prices means Musk is technically worth less. If prices rebound, so does his net worth. While such volatility can devastate smaller investors reliant on their portfolios, it is a recurring feature of ultra-wealth. Consider the US$100 billion decline in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune during his Metaverse pivot, or the US$18 billion drop Microsoft founder Bill Gates experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. These share price shifts may reduce billionaires’ net worth on paper, but they rarely affect their lifestyle. Where they do matter however is in philanthropy. Here, timing is everything. The higher the share price at the point of donation, the greater the tax benefit, and the more reputational capital to be locked in. This raises deeper questions about how philanthropic incentives are structured, and who ultimately benefits. Get your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences. Although philanthropy is often associated with generosity, legacy or moral responsibility, these are only part of the picture. This is particularly true when it comes to major giving by the ultra-wealthy. Instead, from a wealth advisory perspective, one of the most strategically valuable (yet less publicly discussed) motivations is tax management. And, while many assume that philanthropy means donating money, tax systems often encourage the donation of appreciated assets, particularly shares, instead. As a worked example by the Bank of America illustrates, a US$50,000 donation in appreciated stock might easily present a tax benefit of almost US$10,000 over and above the tax benefits of donating the same amount in cash. Why is that? First of all, there is the potential of a tax deduction equal to the fair market value at the point of donation. The value of the asset at the point of donation is important for your tax deduction, not what you actually paid for it or whether its value is going to plunge in future. On top of that, there are opportunities to reduce other taxes too. This includes capital gains or inheritance taxes, the latter illustrated in the establishment of one of the world’s largest foundations, the Ford Foundation and its use as a vehicle to manage both inheritance tax and maintain corporate control. But the benefits of donating shares and other appreciated assets are not just financial. For high-profile donors, philanthropy also serves as a powerful tool for shaping public perceptions, projecting images of civic virtue, moral leadership, and social responsibility. It allows them to convert one form of capital, such as financial wealth, into others – social status, cultural influence or symbolic legitimacy. Volatile, appreciated and often bound-up assets can be unlocked and transformed into something far more enduring – a philanthropic legacy. Even if share prices plunge after the donation, the donor has already secured both a substantial tax benefit and a lasting philanthropic image. Tax management is a longstanding concern in philanthropy, particularly in relation to philanthropic foundations. But it really is donor advised funds (DAFs) that now warrant closer scrutiny as the real “warehouses of wealth”. Constituting one of the fastest-growing vehicles for philanthropy, DAFs act as “giving accounts”. They allow donors to claim charitable contributions and receive immediate tax deductions but without actually making an immediate charitable contribution to society. While donors technically give up ownership of these assets, they retain advisory privileges over whether and when resources are granted, to whom, and in what amounts. DAFs have no legal requirement to disburse funds within a specific timeframe. That means that any charitable spending can be delayed, potentially indefinitely, despite the upfront public subsidy via tax relief. All of these issues raise serious questions as to whether philanthropic architecture is ripe for reform. When donors can receive substantial tax and social benefits by donating volatile assets, regardless of whether or when they benefit the public, it seems that both society and the philanthropy field are shortchanged. First, significant resources are diverted from the public purse into privately controlled channels, often with limited oversight. Second, charitable giving is decoupled from charitable action or impact. Third, influence is consolidated – decisions about how public-subsidised funds are used are made not through democratic processes, but through private choice. The most corrosive effect, however, may be on philanthropy itself. As financial incentives and personal benefits are recast and presented as altruistic, the perception, purposes and potential of philanthropy for the public good risk being eroded and replaced by cynicism. This brings us back to Musk’s US$34 billion “loss”. While headlines framed it as a dramatic reversal of fortune, the real story lies not in the number but in the system behind it. For those whose wealth is held in stock, market volatility presents a tool for tax planning, image-making, strategic giving and long-term influence. What looks like loss may in fact be leverage.

Title: New York Times and Roger Cohen Promote War Again

The NY Times has been a major promoter of US “regime change” operations for decades. Today, while President Trump considers directly involving a US attack on Iran, the NYT is again performing this role despite many readers being skeptical or opposed. A June 19 NYT news/analysis is titled “An Islamic Republic With Its Back Against the Wall” by Roger Cohen. It seems written to pave the way for yet another US-backed or -directed “regime change”. The first sentence asserts without providing evidence that the Tehran government is “an unpopular and repressive regime”. An “Iran expert” is quoted saying, “The Islamic Republic is a rotten tooth waiting to be plucked, like the Soviet Union in its latter years.” . Screenshot from NYT . When Israel bombed the Iranian TV broadcast station as a female news anchor was reading the news, Cohen writes that “Some Iranians were overjoyed”. Cohen uses Netanyahu’s description that Israel’s attacks on Iran are “pre-emptive” and designed to “stop Iran using its enriched uranium to race for a bomb.” He does not mention that even the US intelligence agencies agree that Iran does NOT have a nuclear weapon program. Cohen goes on to quote former BlackRock executive and now German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz: “This mullah regime has brought death and destruction to the world.” Iran has invaded no countries while the US has invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria while Israel has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and now Iran. After suggesting some causes for caution, Cohen closes with his core message: the Tehran government may fall like the Berlin Wall. He quotes the “Iran expert” again: “The Islamic Republic is a zombie regime.” Roger Cohen has been an influential participant in NYT distortions and lies. In 2002, he became NYT foreign editor during the crucial run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As stated at his Wikipedia page, “He supported the invasion.” The deceit about the non-existent “weapons of mass destruction” was under Cohen’s direction. In early March, 2011, Roger Cohen said he was against Western intervention in Libya. Two weeks later, he urged the West to be “ruthless” and to kill the Libyan leader. This has turned out to be yet another disaster. The Libyan people are still paying the price while Roger Cohen has forgotten about it. Roger Cohen, representative of the Times, consistently finds a few voices of opposition, claims without evidence they represent a large group or the civilian majority, then promotes intervention, violence and “regime change”. He did this with Iraq, then Libya, now Iran. Judging from the most popular reader comments, many NYT readers are critical of this “news analysis”. The most popular comment has 1,600 endorsements. Dr. Finn Majlergaard from France says, “What right do you (Americans) think you have to decide who should be in power in sovereign countries when you can’t even deal with your own domestic dictator and the US regime’s gestapo methods against foreigners?” The second most popular comment is from Florence Massachussetts. The reader asks, “Will it be okay if a truly democratic nation bombs the United States in order to encourage regime change away from our current authoritarian rulers?” The vast majority of reader comments are critical of the drive to attack and possibly overthrow yet another government. Apparently they have learned from past foreign policy failures while the NY Times and foreign policy establishment have not. Another disaster based on false assumptions and arrogance lays ahead. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: S&P To Crash 50%? Trump Calls Jerome Powell “Dumbest”

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government [sic]". This is new territory. President Trump had mostly resisted from hurling direct insults against Fed Chair Powell in his second term. Not any more. Could this escalate into Trump firing Chair Powell over the next few months? The comment on social media followed the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, with the Federal Open Market Committee maintaining its target range at 4.25% to 4.5% - unchanged since December. Trump has been calling for lower rates, noting that the Fed was costing the country billions in interest payments. Facade of the Marriner S Eccles building of the United States Federal Reserve, on a bright and sunny ... More day in Washington, DC, United States, July 24, 2017. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Trump’s rhetoric sure does make headlines, but the real danger for investors is the Fed buckling under political pressure and cutting rates too soon. That could unleash a second wave of inflation, which might be more entrenched than the post-Covid surge. If that happens, expect a sharp reset in valuations, a spike in bond yields, and a steep correction in the S&P 500. Cutting interest rates before inflation is fully tamed risks igniting a more persistent cycle of price increases, forcing the Fed to respond later with even more aggressive hikes, just as it did in the 1970s, when inflation spiraled out of control. Is 50% drop in S&P possible? Consider this. Back then, the Fed’s delayed tightening led to stagflation and a severe equity downturn: the S&P 500 fell nearly 50% between 1972 and 1974. What’s more, higher valuations today, coupled with policy uncertainty, might actually make things worse. For investors seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative. This portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered cumulative returns of over 91% since inception. Trump's Policies Create The Perfect Storm? This time around, there is a risk of persistent supply-side inflation driven by policy. Trump’s policy agenda, which includes 3 things [1] tariffs, [2] mass deportations, and [3] tax cuts, could create a perfect storm of sorts. First, tariffs are a supply shock. They raise input costs and consumer prices by removing cheaper imports from the market. Second, mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except that it will make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. This could be a big factor driving inflation higher. Third, there are the tax cuts under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, under which most taxpayers are expected to see a tax cut, with all income groups reportedly likely to benefit. Now, while tariffs and deportations constrain the supply of goods and services to increase prices, reduction in taxes makes more cash available to consumers. So people can spend more while prices are higher. The result would be spiking inflation, and this would make the Fed’s job a lot harder. A Replay of the 1970s? The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now, if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings - risk-free investments - won’t you demand higher earnings and returns from stocks as well? There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) had lost more than 50% in the 2022 rate cycle alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?). Smaller companies, with less cash on their balance sheets, fared even worse. That said, in 2022, inflation was largely transitory, and the Fed was able to bring it under control. This time, it could be entrenched. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time, tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together, are likely to prove a stronger and perhaps much more persistent force. A replaying of the 1970s crisis is very much possible, taking the S&P 500 down. Higher rates don’t just hurt stocks - they make U.S. debt less sustainable. Annual interest payments now already exceed $1 trillion, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a red flag. If bond markets start to question the government’s fiscal path, yields could spike, deepening the equity selloff. On top of that, loan defaults are rising both in the commercial real estate sector and across consumer debt, like credit cards and auto loans. Big lenders like JPMorgan, BofA, and Citigroup are especially exposed. So, how much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $47 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $23 trillion in value. And you thought the $5 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first few days of April 2025 was bad! How Low Can JPMorgan Stock Go In A Market Crash? A Question When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: What’s Happening With MSFT Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 30 May 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The Microsoft logo and lettering can be seen on the Microsoft ... More Deutschland GmbH headquarters building in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on May 30, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) With a 15% rise year-to-date (YTD), Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has fared much better than the broader S&P 500 index, which has gained just 2%. This outperformance is partly attributed to rising demand for Azure amid the AI boom. Microsoft’s substantial AI investments, especially its partnership with OpenAI, have made Azure a highly appealing cloud platform for businesses looking to integrate AI into their operations. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, MSFT stock has doubled since early 2023, supported by three major factors: We’ll examine these drivers in more detail. While MSFT stock has delivered strong returns, those seeking growth with less volatility than individual stocks might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see Archer Aviation: What’s Happening With ACHR Stock? Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% rise in revenue, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $270 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Microsoft's stock has experienced a significant increase in valuation multiples, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio jumping 48% from 9x in 2022 to 13.3x currently. Several key factors are driving this sustained growth: Currently trading around $480, MSFT stock’s P/S multiple of 13.3x is slightly higher than its four-year average of 12.4x. Refer to Microsoft’s Valuation Ratios for additional context. We believe that Microsoft’s valuation is poised for further growth driven by strategic AI initiatives. Azure will benefit from rising enterprise AI adoption, increasing demand for cloud infrastructure, and AI platform services. Additionally, AI integration across Microsoft 365 will boost productivity, enhance user workflows and collaboration, leading to higher subscription retention and premium tier adoption. These AI features are also expected to strengthen Teams engagement, drive enterprise software licensing growth, and accelerate the shift to higher-value cloud services as businesses increasingly rely on Microsoft's comprehensive AI-powered ecosystem. Despite the strong outlook, there are notable risks. In the inflation-led 2022 downturn, MSFT stock dropped 38%, declining from a high of $343 in November 2021 to $214 in November 2022. In contrast, the S&P 500 saw a smaller decline of 25%. Although MSFT rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by June 2023, a similar sell-off occurred earlier this year amid trade war concerns, where MSFT fell nearly 20%, aligning with a 19% drawdown for the S&P 500. More on this is available in our Buy or Sell Microsoft Stock dashboard. Apart from macro and geopolitical risks, Microsoft faces internal challenges, especially regarding its significant capital expenditures. Since 2022, the company’s capital expenditures bill has crossed $144 billion. A pressing question remains: What if these large-scale investments don’t yield the expected returns? Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Governments can make that happen by erecting barriers that keep foreign goods out or make them more expensive.

Editor Empire Jim Quinn, The Burning Platform “But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another—slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death “What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death I find myself ruminating about whether there is anything myself or any other average Joe can do to make a difference in this world, controlled by psychopaths, satanists, egomaniacal billionaires, corrupt evil politicians, a cabal of greedy financiers, neocon warmongering globalists, and the propaganda entertainment complex. When a complex entity becomes too large, it becomes inefficient, bureaucratic, corrupt, and uncontrollable. The corruption, waste, and purposeful use of governmental power to enrich politicians and their billionaire benefactors, to the detriment of the country and the average citizen, has grown to an incomprehensible and uncontainable level. Whether DOGE was a legitimate undertaking by Musk and his tech geniuses to cut wasteful spending and uncover fraud, or nothing more than a PR stunt designed to keep the MAGA army satiated with the appearance of making America great again, it appears to have sunk into the swamps of DC, foiled by the uni-party once again. But the show must go on, and this past week’s episode of “As the Empire Crumbles” was certainly entertaining, with the most powerful politician in the world hurling insults at the richest man in the world, who responded by accusing the president of pedophilia, while calling for his impeachment and the creation of a new political party. The MAGA acolytes were flabbergasted, as their two heroes, who were going to usher in a new golden era, came to blows and have irreconcilably broken up. Who could have predicted that the two biggest egos on the planet would ultimately clash and dissolve their partnership? Many of the twitterati were convinced it was just more 4D chess, just as they believed the Q bullshit during Trump’s first term. The world was captivated and enthralled by this trivial social media war, while NATO/Ukraine desperately attempted to initiate WW3 with their attacks on Russian airbases, the Crimean bridge, and Russian passenger trains. Thousands of tweets and hundreds of articles have been written about this Trump/Musk bickerfest, while the world is imploding and we are accelerating headlong towards a global war, initiated by the three stooges running France, U.K. and Germany, and cheered on by the likes of Lindsey Graham and Mike Pompeo. Trump’s campaign trail promise to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours has proven to be nothing more than his predictable bloviating bullshit. It has become clear he has absolutely no sway over the EU warmongers, or his own Deep State CIA operatives carrying out the attacks on Russia, as his weak and ineffectual efforts to end the conflict start to diminish his presidency from the outset. The Gaza genocide continues, with American financial and military support, even though Trump promised to end that conflict. Iran continues to resist efforts to stop its nuclear enrichment program. China pretends to be negotiating with Trump on tariffs but is content letting the Soros installed leftist judges across the country place roadblock after roadblock in the way of Trump’s tariff, deportation, and governmental downsizing agenda. Foreign leaders know they can wait out all of Trump’s threats by just slow walking negotiations and hoping the Republicans lose the House in 2026. China is biding its time until they believe America is sufficiently preoccupied with its own domestic turmoil and its Ukraine quagmire, and they will initiate their inevitable Taiwan takeover. The United States has not won a war in 80 years and is in no position to wage war in Europe and Asia simultaneously. Trump professes to be for peace, but the Deep State actors controlling the government and the globalist billionaires pulling the strings will force him into WW3. That is how Fourth Turnings roll. With the intense opposition to the Big Beautiful Bill from Musk and key Republicans in the Senate, the next few months could get messy on the fiscal front. Musk is entirely correct, calling the BBB a massive, outrageous, pork-filled disgusting abomination of congressional pork. When the mind numbingly stupid media outlets declare it will add $3 trillion to the national debt over ten years, that means $3 trillion more than the $21 trillion of additional debt already projected. And this assumes no recessions, no financial crisis, no wars, and no fake pandemics. They purposefully give the impression our national debt only goes up by $3 trillion over ten years. I’m absolutely certain the average prole, distracted by their technological bread and circuses, has no clue our debt is on automatic pilot to increase by nearly 70% over the next ten years. The average person remains trapped in a false comfort zone, designed by their overlords, to keep them satiated with toxic foodstuff, propaganda disguised as entertainment, and believing going deeper and deeper into debt, buying trinkets and baubles makes them wealthy. Until that comfort zone is shattered by the bitter reality of the next financial implosion, the masses will do nothing to try and alter the disastrous course plotted by their overlords. The GOP passage of $9.4 billion of DOGE cuts is nothing more than a PR stunt to convince the ignorant masses they are actually doing something about the deficit. The dopes making bets on Draft Kings and posting videos on Instagram have no concept about how ridiculously out of control our government has become. They add $6 billion to the national debt every single day, so their $9.4 of “cuts” will be gone in 37 hours. Our deficits are big, but they are not beautiful. Our deficit in FY24 was $1.8 trillion. Through the first 7 months of FY25 the deficit is $1.049 trillion. At the current rate of spending, the deficit will be $2.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year. Interest on the national debt is now the second biggest expenditure and has gone from $500 billion during Trump’s first term to $1.3 trillion today. These deficits are clearly unsustainable, and anything which is unsustainable will not be sustained. But the corrupt, captured politicians and insatiably avaricious Wall Street bankers will keep dancing until the music stops. Then they will use their next engineered financial crisis to take more of our money and further restrict our liberties and freedom. CBDCs and social credit scores anyone? The real reason Trump and the GOP need to pass the big beautiful, bloated pig of a bill is because our Ponzi scheme economy depends upon the never-ending issuance of trillions in debt every year to give the fabricated appearance of stability. This is why the GOP applauds Musk’s low hanging fruit DOGE cost savings and ignores them in their outrageously corpulent budget bill. The truth is any actual reduction in government spending (36% of GDP) would ripple through an economy entirely dependent upon government largess and immediately create a massive recession and probable depression. Ponzi schemes have to keep growing until they run out of suckers believing the bullshit underlying the Ponzi. This is where those controlling the levers of society (Bernays’ invisible government) utilize their limitless well of propaganda techniques, technological distractions, and mindless entertainment venues to keep the ignorant masses amused, delusional, and living in denial of the reality staring them in the face. Since the 2008 financial crisis we have been muddling through economically at a 10,000 feet macro level, with periodic crisis episodes (housing collapse, fake pandemic) utilized by the powers that be to issue trillions more debt as the antidote to the initial crisis created by too much debt. At a micro level, the average American has seen a significant decline in their standard of living, as official government reported inflation has eroded 40% of their purchasing power, when in reality they have lost more than 60% of their purchasing power. The reality for the average American prole is debt slavery, either self-imposed to keep up with the Joneses or forced upon them to survive this globalist-imposed death by a thousand cuts economy. Credit card debt of $1.3 trillion is at an all-time high, up $350 billion (35%) since 2020. The average balance on those credit cards is over $7,000 and the average interest rate on those unpaid balances is over 21%. Student loan debt of $1.8 trillion is at an all-time high, up $100 billion since 2020, with over 25% of these loans in default. Auto loan debt of $1.7 trillion is at an all-time high, up $350 billion (27%) since 2020. The average length of these loans is now 70 months. The borrower is underwater by the fifth year of these loans. Shockingly, credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been soaring in the last year, with credit card delinquencies above 3% for the first time since 2012, and auto loan delinquencies surpassed 8% for the first time since 2010. Does that sound like a consumer on solid ground? In addition, the housing market is a disaster looking for a trigger. The Wall Street hedge funds (Blackrock) bought up millions of homes, driving prices 140% (Case Siller Index) higher than the 2012 low, while outstanding mortgage debt has risen from the 2012 low of $13 trillion to $21 trillion today. Prices are ridiculously high and mortgage rates of 7% make it virtually impossible for an average working stiff to buy even a small home. The market is frozen. This is why Trump and his GOP minions must avoid a recession at all costs by continuing to rack up $2 trillion annual deficits. A recession would result in millions of layoffs, which would mean unpaid mortgages, which would mean foreclosures and slashing of home prices, which would trigger housing collapse 2.0, which would turn the recession into a depression, causing a stock market collapse. Now you know why they are desperate to pass this big, beautiful behemoth of bilge. The Fed is in a precarious position of their own making, with all choices pointing towards disastrous outcomes. They are already sitting on over $1 trillion of unrealized bond losses, while their Wall Street owners sit on another $400 billion of unrealized bond losses. If these entities ever have to realize those losses, our entire banking system would collapse. The Fed has cut rates by 1%, but market rates went up, as their power to mislead market players diminishes. They have reduced their balance sheet from $9 trillion to $6.7 trillion. The last time they tried to reduce their balance sheet in 2019, the repo market spasmed and they used the Covid cover to drastically print more fiat. Trump is mocking Powell and demanding interest rate cuts. Powell is pretending to be independent, but he is praying for some kind of crisis to again set the printing presses to hyper-speed. I’m sure the ruling oligarchs are hatching a new crisis to expand their wealth, power, and control, while further impoverishing and enslaving the plebs. It is clear at least to me, we stand on the precipice of an economic conflagration capable of putting the final nail in the coffin of this empire of debt. At the same time there are unrelenting evil forces who are frantically creating the casus-belli to initiate World War III and the massive death and destruction that would produce. The simultaneous commencement of these two events would produce the type of climax expected in the waning years of a Fourth Turning, with a final resolution expected by 2032. Most people are blissfully unaware of the imminent demise of their comfortable existence, so addicted to their techno-gadgets and mindless social media performance art, they are incapable of critical thought regarding the dystopian world they inhabit. “People will come to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death “If politics is like show business, then the idea is not to pursue excellence, clarity or honesty but to appear as if you are, which is another matter altogether.” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death If you ever needed proof politics is nothing but show business, it is this big, beautiful bill episode of drama, fiction, comedy, and tragedy. Excellence, clarity, and honesty have no part in this absurd psychodrama of lies, accusations, and continued downward spiral of this empire of debt. We know Huxley believed the masses could be sufficiently distracted by their own ego driven pursuits, but I don’t think even he realized how much power the technological “advances” of our times (TV based mass media, the internet, corporate/government controlled social media, Big Pharma) would be used by the ruling elite to control, manipulate, sedate, and scare the ignorant masses into voluntary subservience. Everything we are witnessing and living through is nothing more than a theater production, designed by Bernays’ invisible governing authorities to herd us towards their technological gulag, with the slaughterhouse as the other alternative. Huxley’s 1932 dystopian vision, which he believed was more likely than Orwell’s 1949 dystopian vision of the future, and reinforced in a letter to Orwell in 1949 shortly before his death, has been the pre-dominant method used by our overlords to rule over, manipulate, and exploit the foibles of the unthinking masses. They have kept their citizens distracted with pleasures, drugged into passivity, taught to feel rather than think in government run indoctrination centers (public schools) and overloaded with so much useless trivial information, they are incapable of distinguishing between good and evil – actually believing their servitude is freedom. While Huxley’s dystopia continues, the ruling class fears their passive mind control methods aren’t as effective in achieving their great reset agenda, and in need of some Orwellian censorship, disinformation, brute force, government intimidation, harsh mind control, and guaranteeing compliance through fear. Aren’t we lucky to be experiencing the best of both dystopian visions. Those controlling the levers of society have used the school system to create a soulless amalgamation of hedonistic mass consumers; purposeless, apathetic, with muddled brains unable to understand their unintended enslavement to the evil demons running our world and controlling their lives. Knowing most of what we see on our screens and hear from supposed “experts”, left wing corporate media talking heads, and Fox News bimbos, is gibberish and propaganda, it is hard to distinguish real threats from clickbait, purposeful disinformation, and scare tactics designed to make you do what they want you to do. The precarious financial situation of the country is real. The danger from an AI cage built through a tech-state merger with Palantir to surveil and digitally profile everyone is real. The threat of the Ukraine-Russia conflict morphing into WW3 is real. The desire by billionaire globalists to introduce a Great Reset, Great Taking, and CBDCs is real. The planned, funded, and executed invasion of our southern border during the Basement Dummy administration by third world dregs, with the sole intention of destroying the social fabric and finances of the country, run by the Soros/Clinton/Obama triumvirate is real. Even with the dismantling of their USAID insurrection funding source, this week’s festivities in Los Angeles kicked off the summer of civil war. There is nothing real or spontaneous about these riots. Whenever pallets of bricks suddenly show up on streets in city centers, you know Soros and his ilk are behind the organized destruction of that particular city. The brick and bomb throwers are being paid to riot and take photo ops. This will assuredly be rolled out in our other Democrat controlled urban shitholes across the land. The governor of California and the communist mayor of Los Angeles are paid acolytes of Soros, stoking insurrection and should be arrested and thrown into the dungeons of DC, like the grandmothers and patriots who sauntered through the Capitol on January 6. We find ourselves on the precipice of a financial, social, and military calamity, all driven by the three driving forces of this Fourth Turning: debt, civic decay, global disorder. Anyone not noticing events are intensifying, conflict is expanding, anger is building, and the world is accelerating towards that precipice at breakneck speed, is simply ignorant or their minds are so numbed by their i-gadgets and government school indoctrination, that it’s beyond their comprehension to acknowledge reality. At this point in history, I do not believe there are enough awakened critical thinking citizens to make a difference during the waning years of this Fourth Turning. We can’t vote our way out. We likely can’t shoot our way out. We can’t buy our way out. When the majority are proud of their ignorance and believe it is superior to actual knowledge, your society is pretty much screwed. “What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of ‘being informed’ by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information–misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information – information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death The existing financial, social and political paradigms will have to collapse and be swept away for any real change to occur. The problem is it appears that is exactly what the billionaire globalist elite are trying to trigger. In the aftermath, amidst chaos, financial ruin, civil and global war, social strife, and a political vacuum, they envision establishing an authoritarian global world order, with CBDCs, social credit scores, 15-minute cities, and Big Brother level surveillance. If this vision prevails, Orwell wins the award over Huxley for the most accurate dystopian nightmare. Our only hope resides in the hubris and arrogance of the ruling class. Once the collapse is underway, its course is unpredictable and unstable. The best laid plans have a way of going awry. This could offer an opportunity for normal rational people to make their stand. If a liberty movement, backed by the 300 million firearms residing in the red states, could re-ignite the brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, maybe we could reset the course of our country. The odds probably aren’t worse than they were in 1776. At this point, all we can do is prepare mentally, physically, and spiritually for the coming storm. Buy supplies, guns and ammo. And remember what your forefathers accomplished with far less. The choice is slavery or freedom. “It does not take a majority to prevail … but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.” ― Samuel Adams “The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be free men or slaves.” – George Washington Support the Truth: SEMI-ANNUAL TBP BEG-A-THON Empire Empire Empire Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: The tech job market is rough for entry-level workers right now. Here's how Gen Z is dodging the downtrend.

Time Published: 2025-06-20T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Recent years of rolling layoffs in tech have some Gen Z tech workers stressed — but not deterred. "I feel like everyone feels a bit stressed that there are layoffs," said Merc Heredia-Ferran, a 26-year-old brand marketer at Google who joined the company last year. "I get sent articles that Google laid off people that I didn't even know about, like I'm reading that in the news." The job market has hit Gen Z hard. While older millennials faced higher unemployment rates following the Great Recession compared to Gen Z now, Gen Z experiences unique challenges such as increased Big Tech cost-cutting and AI upending the workplace. BI spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z tech workers and job seekers about their experiences as they hustle to start their careers and as artificial intelligence and changing corporate and immigration policies transform early-career workers' introduction to the workplace. A SignalFire report found that entry-level hiring in Big Tech is down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels; at startups, it's down more than 30%. The percentage of graduates from top computer science programs employed at Big Tech companies has halved since 2022, the report found. As tech companies pull back hiring across the industry, it's become a tighter job market for Gen Z. The New York Fed reported that unemployment for recent college graduates who majored in computer science was 6.1%, compared to 5.8% for recent college graduates overall. Layoff concerns also weigh heavily in the tech field. Over 28% of job seekers age 18 to 24 and over 21% of those age 25 to 34 say they were laid off in their last job, a ZipRecruiter survey from the first quarter of this year found. Tech still remains a popular career choice for Gen Z in part because of its schedule flexibility, which is prioritized by 90% of graduates, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. Tech jobs often pay more compared to many other careers. "Agencies, you can be cut at any time," Heredia-Ferran said. "You don't even see it coming. Here I feel like, with the high salary, if it happens, I have a cushion now, and the Google name, I can maybe land something if it happens." A software engineer at Amazon says he "got lucky" in landing his full-time job at Amazon. When the 26-year-old India native interned at the e-commerce giant in 2023, the timing was anything but ideal: Their offer coincided with a hiring freeze. "After September 2022, Amazon just stopped hiring interns for that year," the engineer told BI. They completed their internship and received an "inclined to hire" evaluation in August 2023. Due to the freeze, they didn't start their full-time role until June 2024. Compared to the thousands of laid-off employees across tech and at Amazon, among them, peers still looking for work, they're grateful. "I can't give much advice to someone who is looking for a job. I myself can't crack exactly how I landed the job. I just got lucky in that," the engineer said. Expectations don't always match reality. Nearly 40% of rising graduates believe an internship will help them land a job, yet 9% of recent grads said their internships helped them do that, ZipRecruiter found in a 2025 survey of 3,000 recent and rising undergraduate students ZipRecruiter found that rising graduates believe they'll earn a salary of $101,500; recent grads earned an average of $68,400. "The expectation versus reality gap is quite high," said DeMase. If young workers do get the tech job they seek, a complicating factor is the growth of AI. A Hult International Business School survey found 37% of HR leaders say they'd rather use AI than hire a recent graduate. Young workers say AI has helped them and left them feeling uncertain. "In terms of work, it's gotten to a very interesting place because a lot of things that used to take me a day to do, I can now do them in one hour, but that hasn't translated into my work decreasing. It's just more work," the Amazon engineer said. "I don't know if we'll reach the point when AI is doing everything I'm doing and finally replace me," they continued with a nervous laugh. Upon graduation in 2022, Jonathan, a now 26-year-old software engineer, set about applying for tech jobs. He applied to about 300 roles and received 12 responses, some of which were coding tests, before finally landing a full-time job after three months. Nine months later, he was laid off when his tech company closed the office where he was based, meaning he was once again on the job hunt. This time, he applied to about 600 roles, and he heard back from five. "I was talking with some other former classmates and people graduating in the same year," said Jonathan, who asked to withhold his last name due to company policies on speaking with the press. "Most of us were in the same boat. We just graduated, never found anything, and had just gotten laid off from another position. We were all weighing our options. Should we go back and get our master's? It didn't seem like anyone was hiring early-level positions." Tyler Creach, a 26-year-old senior business development manager at software company Freshworks, also said she found the job market difficult before landing her role, which took about four to five months. The tech industry can be "hard to predict" for young people, and it's tough to "see yourself in it for a long time, she said. "Young people are struggling to find stable, relatively well-paying jobs," Creach said. "That's creating a lot of resentment or frustration, possibly from young people. Instead of getting a start right away, they're punting it down the line." The ZipRecruiter survey found that over half of tech job seekers age 25 to 34 and nearly 44% of those age 18 to 24 say they received zero job offers in the past month. ZipRecruiter found that a majority of job seekers in these age demographics say they've been ghosted by an employer during their job search, an experience that has become more common for Gen Z. Over 30% of them say their job search is going "poor" and over half say it's just going "fair." Creach found she had to compromise her job expectations, particularly in location. She previously had all-remote roles and ended up taking a job that required going to an office. She hopes to eventually do something more creative in her career or move into management. "Now it is super difficult to get a job for those remote roles," Creach said. "I had to think about how I could start getting more interviews. Once I started looking at more jobs based in my area, whether hybrid or fully in-office, I started to get more responses and make more progress." Jonathan landed his current job after three to four months. It did require moving states, and he now works in defense tech and not his preferred industry, video games. He says he's trying to get any experience he can. "My dad said when he graduated, it was difficult for him to find a job," Jonathan said. "In the early 90s, there was a mini-recession. To some degree, it has gotten harder over the years to land anything. Everyone tells you to get into computer science. That's where all the money is at, that's where the jobs are at. It's a lot harder than they make it out to be." Despite the job market slowdown, many Gen Z tech workers are still optimistic about working in tech. Justin Dobey, 27, pursued a master's degree in 2020 as the COVID pandemic began. After graduation, his job search just took about a month since there's a "deep lack of electrical engineers" where he lives in South Carolina. He works in a federal government engineering job that has rolled back hiring, though he hasn't been affected by cuts. Dobey said his friends with non-engineering degrees are struggling more to find work than his peers in engineering. "We might not all be in our dream jobs, but they are doing all right, last time I checked." Dobey said he's optimistic about the future of STEM jobs. "If you want to live comfortably and not want to work your whole life like, be a doctor or lawyer, get a STEM degree in computer systems, cybersecurity, AI," he said. DeMase, the ZipRecruiter career expert, said it's important for tech job seekers to learn more about AI and use it ethically. She also advises using their network, getting to know more people in the industry, and tailoring résumés to better align with target roles, which can even include skills from volunteering or part-time work "When folks think about the roles they'll apply for, it's important to lean into their strengths and target roles that are hyperaligned with their superpowers," DeMase said. She also said it's important to speak clearly about the impact they've made in their work or in their projects. "Gen Z approaches the interview as an interrogation rather than a conversation," DeMase said. "It's a conversation, not an interrogation. Come prepared to have an organic chat. Don't be afraid to remember you're interviewing as well." Jump to

InfoQ Homepage Articles Analyzing Apache Kafka Stretch Clusters: WAN Disruptions, Failure Scenarios, and DR Strategies Jun 20, 2025 31 min read by Srikanth Daggumalli Nishchai Jayanna Manjula reviewed by Steef-Jan Wiggers Apache Kafka is a well-known publish-subscribe distributed system widely used across industries for use cases such as log analytics, observability, event-driven architectures, and real-time streaming. Its distribution allows it to become the critical piece or backbone of modern streaming architecture, offering many integrations and supporting near-real-time or real-time latency requirements. Today, Kafka has been offered by major companies as a service, including Confluent Kafka as well as cloud offerings such as Confluent Cloud, AWS Managed Streaming Kafka , Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hub for Apache Kafka, etc. Additionally, Kafka has been deployed across over one-hundred-thousand companies, including Fortune 100 across various industry segments such as enterprise, financials, healthcare, automobile, startups, independent software vendors, and retail sectors. The value of the data diminishes over time. Many businesses these days compete in time and demand real-time data processing with millisecond responses to power mission-critical applications. Financial services, e-commerce, IoT, and other latency-sensitive industries require highly available and resilient architectures that can withstand infrastructure failures without impacting business continuity. Companies operating across multiple geographic locations need solutions that provide seamless failover, data consistency, and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities while minimizing operational complexity and cost. One of the common architectural patterns that companies often consider using is a single Kafka cluster spanning multiple data center locations on WAN (Wide Area Network). It is called Stretch Cluster. This pattern is commonly considered by companies for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA). Stretch Cluster can theoretically provide data redundancy across regions and minimize data loss in the event of a region-wide failure. However, this approach comes with several challenges and trade-offs due to the inherent nature of Kafka and its dependency on network latency, consistency, and partition tolerance in a multi-region setup. In this article, we are going to focus on the stretch cluster architectural pattern for DR or HA-related implications and considerations. The following testing has been conducted, and the cluster behavior has been documented. Below is the high-level view of a single stretch cluster setup that spans across the London and Frankfurt regions with In this use case, we have used a producer written in Java that consistently produces defined (K) Transactions Per Second (aka TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Sample snippets using Kafka performance test api. In this use case, we have used consumers written in Java that consistently consume defined (K) transactions per second (TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Before diving into further discussions and scenario executions, it's crucial to understand the fundamental algorithms of distributed systems. This foundational knowledge will help you better correlate WAN disruptions with their impact on system behavior. CAP Theorem (i.e., Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance) applies to all the distributed systems like Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, and many others, where data is being distributed across nodes to: Consistency (C) Every read gets the latest write or an error. Availability (A) Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail. Partition Tolerance (P) The system keeps working despite network issues. Kafka is an AP system; it prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, while consistency is eventual and tunable via settings. Now, let's get into the scenarios. Before going in-depth into scenarios, let's understand the key components and terminology of Kafka internals. As discussed in earlier sections, in a distributed network setup across geographic locations, network service interruptions can occur because no service guarantees 100% availability. This scenario focuses on WAN disruption between two regions, causing Kafka service unavailability, leaving the cluster with zero active controllers and no self-recovery, even after hours of waiting. Kafka is unavailable and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and reestablishment and shows active controllers as '0' It's a "brain-dead" scenario. Upon WAN disruption, a single 4-node cluster becomes 2 independent clusters, each with 2 nodes. WAN disruption can be done by deleting or modifying route tables. Warning: Deleting a route table may disrupt all traffic in the associated subnets. Instead, consider modifying or detaching the route table. You may need to shut down firewalls Firewall status: systemctl status firewalld Firewall stop: service firewalld stop ZK Server start: bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties ZK Server stop: zookeeper-server-stop ZK Shell commands: bin/zookeeper-shell.sh <zookeeper host>:2181 Active controllers check: get /controller or ls /controller Brokers list: /home/opc/kafka/bin/zookeeper-shell kafkabrokeraddress:2181 <<<"ls /brokers/ids" Alternative to check controllers and brokers in a cluster. Available from kafka 3.7.x bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh --bootstrap-server <KAFKA_BROKER>:9092 --describe-cluster Kafka is not available and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and re-establishment and shows active controllers as '2' Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own upon and showed active controllers as '0' From the logs, observed disk-related errors and exceptions Logs show that the controller moved the exception from one broker to another broker, but no exit or hang was reported in the logs Controllers '0' behavior is equal to the brain-dead scenario explained in scenario 2. Killing broker and ZK processes (an uncontrolled shutdown can be comparable with machine abrupt reboot) and restarting brokers lead to corrupted indices, rebuilding indices doesn't work even after hours of waiting. This scenario is comparable to an ungraceful shutdown during an environment upgrade or to a poor security posture, where an unauthorized person could terminate the service. Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own. From the logs, 'index corrupted' logs for partitions are shown, and also 'rebuilding indices logs'. Rebuilding indices didn't work and doesn't show any related logs on progress. The resulting cluster is in unavailable status even after 1 hour. Also, it is recommended to do graceful shutdowns instead of using the kill switch or doing abrupt shutdowns so the data in the Kafka local cache will be flushed to the disks by maintaining meta data information and also committing offsets. Deploying on-premise stretch clusters requires a deep understanding of failure scenarios, particularly during network disruptions. Unlike cloud environments, on-premises setups may lack highly available network infrastructure, fault tolerance mechanisms, or dedicated fiber lines, making them more susceptible to outages. In such cases, a Kafka cluster may experience downtime if network connectivity is disrupted. Cloud providers, on the other hand, offer high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber connections between regions and data centers. Their managed Kafka services are designed for high availability, typically recommending deployment across multiple zones or regions to withstand zonal failures. Additionally, these services incorporate zone-awareness features, ensuring Kafka data replication occurs across multiple zones, rather than being confined to a single one. It is also important to understand and emphasize the latency impact on a stretch cluster deployed in two different Geo locations with a WAN connection. We can not escape physics; in our case, as per WonderNetwork, the average latency between London and Frankfurt is 14.88 milliseconds for a distance of 636km. So, for mission-critical applications, the setup of a stretch cluster driven by latencies, through testing, is needed to determine how the data is being replicated and consumed across. By understanding these differences, organizations can make informed decisions about whether an on-premise stretch cluster aligns with their availability and resilience requirements or if a cloud-native Kafka deployment is a more suitable alternative. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is essential for any business to maintain its brand and reputation. Almost all the companies think of High Availability (HA) and Disaster recovery (DR) strategies to meet their BCP. Below are the popular DR Strategies for Kafka. Before we dive deep into DR strategies further, let's understand that the Kafka Mirror Maker 2.0 we are using in the following architectural patterns. There are other components like Kafka Connect, Replicator, etc., offered by Confluent and other cloud services, but they are out of scope for this article. DNS Redirection in Apache Kafka is a cross-cluster replication tool that uses the Kafka Connect framework to replicate topics between clusters, supporting active-active and active-passive setups. It provides automatic consumer group synchronization, offset translation, and failover support for disaster recovery and multi-region architectures. This is a popular DR strategy pattern where there will be two different Kafka clusters, which are of identical size & configuration, deployed in two different Geo regions or Data centers. In this case, it's the London and Frankfurt regions. Usually, Geo location choice depends upon Earth's different tectonic plates, company or country compliance and regulations requirements, and other factors. Out of which only one cluster is active at a given point of time, which receives and serves the clients. As shown in the following picture, Kafka cluster one (KC1) is located in the London region and Kafka cluster two (KC2) is located in the Frankfurt region with the same size and configuration. All the producers are producing data to KC1 (London region cluster), and all consumers are consuming the data from the same cluster. KC2 (Frankfurt region cluster) receives the data from the KC1 cluster through Mirror Maker as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Kafka Active Standby (aka Active Passive) cluster setup with Mirror role In simple terms, we can treat the mirror maker as a combination of producer and consumer, where it consumes the topics from the source cluster KC1 (London region) and produces the data to the destination cluster KC2 (Frankfurt region). During the disaster to the primary/active cluster KC1 (London region), the standby cluster (Frankfurt region) will become active, and all the producers and consumers' traffic redirected to the standby cluster. This can be achieved through DNS redirection via a load balancer in front of Kafka clusters. Fig 2 shows this scenario. Figure 2: Kafka Active Standby setup - Standby cluster becomes active When the London Region KC1 cluster becomes active, we need to set up a mirror maker instance to consume the data from the Frankfurt region cluster and produce back to it to the London region KC1 cluster. This scenario is shown in Fig. 3. It's up to the business to keep the Frankfurt region (KC2) active or promote the London region cluster (KC1) back to primary once the data is fully synced/hydrated to the current state. In some cases, the standby cluster, i.e., the Frankfurt region cluster (KC2), continues to function like an active cluster and the London region cluster (KC1) becomes the standby as well. It is essential to note that RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) values are high compared to the Active-Active setup. Active-standby setup cost is medium to high as we need to maintain the same Kafka clusters in both regions. Figure 3: Kafka Active Standby setup – Standby cluster data sync happening to the KC1 Kafka Mirror Maker Replication Lag (Δ): Let's take a scenario, and it might happen very rarely, where we lose all the cluster completely, including nodes and disks, etc. Where the Active Kafka Cluster (London region - KC1) has 'm' messages, and the mirror maker is consuming and producing to the standby cluster. Due to network latency or consumers & producing process with acknowledgements, the standby cluster (i.e., Frankfurt region - KC2) lags behind and holds only 'n' messages. Which means the delta(\(\Delta\)) is m minus n. \(\Delta = m - n\) where: Due to this replication lag (\(\Delta\)), it will have the following impact on mission-critical applications Potential Message Loss: If a failover occurs before the Standby cluster catches up, some messages (\(\Delta\)) may be missing. Inconsistent Data: Consumers relying on the Standby cluster may process incomplete or outdated data. Delayed Processing: Applications depending on real-time replication may experience latency in data availability. The replication lag concern can be overcome with the Active-Active setup. Just like the Active standby setup, we will have the same Kafka clusters deployed in the London and Frankfurt regions. The producers of the ingestion pipeline will write the data to both clusters at any given point in time. Which is also known as Dual Writes. So, both clusters' data is in sync as shown in Fig. 4. Please note that the ingestion pipeline or producers should have the capability to support dual writes. It is also important to note that these write pipelines should be isolated so that any issue with one cluster should not impact other pipelines or create back pressure and producer latencies. For example, if your use case is log analytics or observability, considering Logstash in your ingestion and creating two separate pipelines within a single or more Logstash instances will act as an isolated pipeline. But only one cluster is active for the consumers at any given point of time. Figure 4: Active-Active setup or Dual writes. In case, as shown in Figure 5, any issues with the one cluster the consumers need to be redirected with DNS redirect and RTO and RPO or SLAs are near zero. Figure 5: Active-Active setup, one cluster is unavailable Once the London cluster is available and becomes active, data can sync back to the London cluster from the Frankfurt cluster using Mirror Maker. As shown in Fig. 6, consumers can be switched back to the London cluster using DNS redirect. Also, it is important to configure consumer groups to start where they left off. During this setup, during the failover, it is important to configure consumers' offset to read the messages from a particular point in time, like reply messages from the last current time minus 15 mins, or set up a mirror maker between active clusters to read 'only' consumer offset topics from the London region cluster and replicate to the Frankfurt region cluster. And during the failure, you can use source.auto.offset.reset=latest to read the data from the latest offsets in the Frankfurt region cluster. If the consumer groups are not properly configured, you may see duplicate messages in your downstream system. So, it's essential to design the downstream to handle duplicate records. For example, if it's an observability use case and if the downstream is OpenSearch, it's good practice to design a unique ID depending on the message timestamp and other parameters like session IDs, etc. So, that duplicate message will overwrite the existing duplicate record and maintain only one record. Figure 6: Active-Active setup cluster syncing data with MirrorMaker Message ordering challenges occur when writing to two clusters simultaneously, messages may arrive in different orders due to network delays between regions. This can be particularly problematic for applications that require strict message ordering. So, it needs to be handled in the data processing time or downstream systems. For example, defining a primary key within the message body timestamp field would order the messages based on timestamps. Data Consistency Issues can occur while establishing dual writes to two different clusters. It requires robust monitoring and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity across clusters. Because there might be conditions where data might successfully write to one cluster but fail in another, resulting in data inconsistency. Producer complexity is an issue in this active-active setup. Producers need to handle writing to two clusters and manage failures independently for each cluster, so isolation of each pipeline is important. This setup might increase the complexity of the producer applications and require more resources to manage dual writes effectively. There are some agents or tools in the market also as open-source offerings that will provide dual pipeline options such as Elastic Logstash. Consumer group management is complex. Managing consumer offsets across multiple clusters could be challenging, especially during failover scenarios, and can lead to message duplication. Consumer applications or downstream systems need to be designed to handle duplicate messages or implement deduplication logic. Operational Overhead - Running active-active clusters requires sophisticated monitoring tools and increases operational costs significantly. Teams need to maintain detailed runbooks and conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure smooth failover processes. Network Latency Considerations- Cross-region network latency and bandwidth costs become critical factors in active-active setups. Reliable network connectivity between regions is essential for maintaining data consistency and managing replication effectively. Backup and restore is a cost-effective architectural pattern compared to Active Standby(AP) or Active Active(AA) DR architectural patterns. It is suitable for non-critical applications with higher RTO and RPO values compared to AA or AP patterns. Backup and restore is a cost-effective option because we need only one Kafka cluster. In case the Kafka cluster is unavailable, the data from the centralized repository can be replayed/restored to the Kafka cluster once it becomes available. In this architectural pattern, shown in Figure 7, all the data will be saved to a persistent location like Amazon S3 or another data lake, where the data can be restored/replayed to the Kafka cluster when the Kafka cluster is available. It is also common to see a new environment of Kafka clusters built together using terraform templates and build a new Kafka cluster and replay data. Figure 7: Backup and restore architectural pattern Recovery time impact is a major consideration; Restoring (aka replaying) large volumes of data to Kafka can take significant time, resulting in a higher RTO. This makes it suitable only for applications that can tolerate longer downtimes. Data consistency challenges are also an issue. When restoring data from backup storage like Amazon S3, maintaining the exact message ordering and partitioning as the original cluster can be challenging. Special attention is needed to ensure data consistency during restoration. Backup performance overhead is a further consideration. Regular backups to external storage can impact the performance of the production cluster. The backup process needs careful scheduling and resource management to minimize impact on production workloads. Storage is key. Managing large volumes of backup data requires effective storage lifecycle policies and controlling costs. Regular cleanup of old backups and efficient storage utilization strategies are essential. Coordination during recovery is mandatory. The recovery process requires careful coordination between backing up offset information and actual messages. Missing either can lead to message loss or duplication during restoration. As we explored earlier, choosing a DR strategy isn't one-size-fits-all, it comes with trade-offs. It often boils down to finding the right balance between what the business needs and what it can afford. The decision usually depends on several factors. SLAs (e.g., 99.99%+ uptime) are pre-defined commitments to uptime and availability. An SLA requiring 99.99% uptime allows only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year. The RTO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a failure before it causes unacceptable business harm. Knowledge/content/training systems, for example, can expect one hour or more downtime because they are not mission critical. For banking applications, on the other hand, downtime acceptance could be none or a couple of minutes. The RPO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disruptive event, measured in time from the most recent backup. For example, an observability/monitoring application can have the acceptability for losing the past hour whereas a financial application can not tolerate losing a single record of transaction data. Associated costs vary. Higher availability and faster recovery typically come at a higher price. Organizations must weigh their need for uptime and data protection against the financial investment required. References: A round-up of last week’s content on InfoQ sent out every Tuesday.

Title: Do The Woo Community: The Value of Starting Over in the Tech Industry

Posted by Bob Dunn There’s a myth in the tech industry that success is a straight line: get the degree, land the job, climb the ladder, maybe start a startup, and everything falls into place. But as shared by Mendel Kurland on an episode of the series DevPulse: Expanding the Stack,” the truth is anything but linear. Mendel’s story starts with a refreshingly humble admission. He failed out of college, earning what he calls a “0.52 GPA.” Instead of this being the end, it marked an unconventional new beginning. Mendel launched his first startup while scraping by, sleeping in his car with his cats, and building websites for local businesses. The drive to bounce back, hustle through uncertainty, and learn along the way became his greatest assets. Thanks to our sponsor Woo: As a shop owner or site builder, whether you’re just starting or scaling up, WooCommerce makes it simple to build and grow an online store, your way. The podcast episode revisits Mendel’s journey through major players like GoDaddy, Amazon, and DigitalOcean. But what stands out is his advice for anyone feeling stuck: “People unfortunately need resilience right now. They need hustle, and they need to reinvent themselves.” In today’s climate of restructuring and layoffs, Mendel stresses that the key to thriving is not to cling to past successes, but to be willing to try something new, even if it means starting from scratch. Mendel and the hosts emphasize an often-overlooked skill in tech: self-awareness. Whether shifting from coding to consulting, product management to community building, or even just taking a new route to an old job, regularly stepping outside routine and asking, “Does this still fit who I am?” is what separates those who thrive from those who stagnate. For Mendel, reinvention isn’t just about career pivots. It’s about re-examining what brings you fulfillment and finding ways to be useful sometimes in roles you’d never anticipated. As tech rapidly evolves, he advocates exploring adjacent paths, embracing discomfort, and connecting with community. “Progress is always forward and progress is always new,” Mendel says. The people who succeed aren’t guaranteed a path, they’re just better at finding the next one. The episode is a candid conversation about the realities of tech careers, but it’s just as much a call to action for anyone in the WordPress, WooCommerce, or broader tech ecosystem. Reinvention and resilience aren’t reserved for the rare. There are common skills we can all practice: active listening, self-analysis, and genuine curiosity. So, for anyone feeling uncertain about what’s next, remember Mendel’s story: sometimes the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and have the courage to build the future you want, even if it means starting over.

Title: US Banks That Fueled Ireland’s Finance Rebound Face Tariff Angst

(Bloomberg) -- When the US launched sweeping tariffs against trade partners in April, BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink found himself in Ireland, one of the countries with most to lose if US multinationals were forced to curtail their operations overseas. Fink, whose company was in the running for a major contract with the Irish government at the time, toed a careful line, claiming to “understand the logic” of Donald Trump’s move while not agreeing with it, and insisting there “does not need to be a true trade war.” Almost three months on, the Wall Street giants that created thousands of Dublin jobs since Brexit are in a similarly awkward position. They’re trying to balance the challenges created by their own government with the opportunities in a country that depends on US multinationals for more than 10% of its jobs and a big chunk of tax receipts. For now, the banks are hopeful their multinational clients will adapt to the trade uncertainty. “It’s not obvious to me that that falls off a cliff” under the threat of tariffs, says Marc Hussey, the Irish-born JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive who returned home to run the bank’s 1,500-strong Dublin business in 2022. Assuming multinationals “shrink overnight” would be an “extreme view,” Hussey added, and he is “not sensing that from any of our clients.” He continues to see growth in the range of businesses he oversees including a global funds administration center, a workplace solutions business that runs employment share programs across the world and the EMEA hub for Chase payments technology. Ireland remains popular in JPMorgan’s head office too — CEO Jamie Dimon will travel to Dublin next month to speak at an event, his fourth such trip in six years. Almost a decade on from the UK’s Brexit vote that cut off London’s banks from a several markets inside the European Union, Ireland has become a big draw for foreign lenders. They now employ close to 15,000 people, according to a report from the Federation of International Banks in Ireland last month, with firms including JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. leading the way to set up major EU businesses in the country. That choice puts them at the eye of the tariffs storm in a market that has long been heavily exposed to US multinationals, prompting recent warnings about the outlook for the economy and the risk to financial stability. As part of the EU, Ireland’s fate is tied to negotiations with Trump ahead of a July 9 deadline, after which nearly all of the bloc’s imports to the US will be hit with a 50% levy. Across the River Liffey from JPMorgan’s offices, Citi’s 2,900 staff are working across an innovation hub, the group’s EU bank headquarters and an international corporate banking businesses. Citi CEO Jane Fraser was in town a few weeks ago to mark the bank’s 60th anniversary in the nation, and hailed Ireland as “a hub for innovation, a magnet for multinationals and a vital part of the world’s economic landscape.” The bank’s new Dublin office, to be opened next year with space for an extra 400 staff, is “a symbol of our long-term investment in Ireland and in Europe,” she added in a LinkedIn post. Hussey is hoping the move increases the chances of a long-promised footbridge that would link JPMorgan on Dublin’s southside to the northside of the Liffey, where Citi’s new office will join the Central Bank of Ireland’s headquarters. Davinia Conlan, Citi’s Ireland head and chair of industry group FIBI, argues that there is “a lot to be positive about from an Ireland domestic economy perspective” and she is hopeful that Citi will ultimately fill its 3,300 capacity in the new site, though she’s not putting any time line on that. “We’re still expecting the economy to, to grow albeit at a slower pace than we would’ve seen previously,” she said. Wish List Ireland also offers companies the benefit of “ease of access” to government, Conlan said. The Department of Finance will soon launch an industry consultation on its next international financial services strategy, a successor to the Ireland for Finance strategy launched in 2020 which covers banks, insurers, funds and other firms that combined employ around 60,000. Regulatory simplification will be high on the industry’s wish list, Conlan and her peers say, with firms set to call on Ireland to remove some “gold-plating” of EU rules and to push the bloc to be more competitive around regulation. The international banks’ federation, FIBI, is preparing a proposal on simplification which will offer examples of areas where regulation can be “more efficient,” Conlan said, declining to offer goldplating examples before that. Investments in infrastructure and housing, including a long promised airport metro, will also be on the list. Fernando Vicario, who heads Bank of America’s Dublin-based EU head office, is hopeful that imminent reform of the EU’s securitization market will offer a further boost for his 1,300-strong team, which has been retaining its earnings to support future growth. “Ireland can be a place where these securitization deals can be packaged out of Ireland into the rest of Europe,” he said, adding that the country already commands a big presence in this market. Vicario does not expect the Irish government to pivot to protectionist sentiment, which has cropped up in some countries in response to Trump’s trade approach. “I learned in Boston that America is Irish,” says Vicario. “In business, people stick to their positions and do business. And we do business with Irish headquartered companies and with Irish branches and subsidiaries of US companies, all day long. I have quite frankly no problem whatsoever with our passport referring to our US origin.” Ireland has shown it has no problems with US companies either: following Fink’s careful diplomacy, BlackRock was last month named a preferred bidder to help manage the country’s multibillion-euro pension program. --With assistance from Leonard Kehnscherper.

David Sorensen claims Israel's true purpose is to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government, orchestrated by Zionist elites in powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. Sorensen alleges Israel intentionally fostered Hamas to justify military expansion, citing Netanyahu's 2019 remarks and suspicious IDF security failures during the October 7 attack as evidence of a staged provocation. He traces Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, accusing them of satanic motives symbolized by occult imagery (e.g., the City of London's dragon crest) and hijacking Christianity to serve political Zionism. Sorensen condemns Christian Zionism as a distortion of scripture, arguing that true Israel is spiritual â not a militarized state. He blames elite-funded doctrines (e.g., Scofield Study Bible) for misleading believers. Despite exposing conflict as manufactured, Sorensen envisions Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation and plans a follow-up documentary. His core message urges unity over violence, encouraging resistance against artificial divisions. The Health Ranger Mike Adams sat down withÂ David Sorensen, a missionary journalist and filmmaker behind the documentary "The Mystery of Israel," on the Health Ranger Report. Their conversation delved intoÂ the hidden agendas behind the Israel-Palestine conflict. Sorensen began by elaboratingÂ a globalist plot to establish Jerusalem as the center of a one-world government.Â The founder ofÂ StopWorldControl.comÂ argues that Israel's geopolitical significance extends far beyond its small geographic footprint. He claims that Zionist elites are orchestrating a plan to centralize control in Jerusalem. Many of these elites helm powerful institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard and global health organizations. "The vast majority of people haven't got the slightest clue about the real agenda with Israel â that it's all about establishing a one-world government from within Jerusalem,"Â Sorensen stated. He emphasized that mainstream narratives suppress this truth, labeling dissenters as "antisemitic" to silence criticism. One of the most explosive claims in Sorensen's documentary is that the Palestinian military group Hamas (formally theÂ Islamic Resistance Movement) was deliberately fostered by Israel to justify military expansion. He cited statements from Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas," the incumbent Israeli leader allegedly said in 2019. "This is part of our strategy." Sorensen also referenced whistleblowers from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who claim that Israel's advanced border security systems inexplicably failed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack. This raises suspicions of a staged provocation, with the missionary journalist arguing that no military commander in his right mind would carry out such an irrational suicide mission â unless they knew retaliation was part of a larger plan. Israel's Rothschild connection and the role of satanic influence Sorensen traced Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, whom he accused of funding the state's creation as part of a satanic agenda. He pointed to the City of London's crest â featuring two dragons â as symbolic of their allegiance to dark forces. (Related:Â The history of the House ofÂ Rothschild.) "They don't even hide their Satanism,"Â he said, referencing biblical descriptions of the dragon as Satan.Â "The Rothschilds are known to be at the heads of Satanism. They are a very satanic family." A significant portion of the interview focused on Christian Zionism â a movement that unconditionally supports Israel based on theological interpretations. Sorensen added that they have hijacked Christianity to turn believers away from Christ and toward a political, militarized Israel. The filmmaker condemned this ideology as a distortion of scriptureÂ â arguing that true Israel is spiritual, not political as God never promised a military state. Christ fulfilled all prophecies, and His kingdom is within each individual. Sorensen blamed the elite-funded Scofield Study Bible for twisting Christian doctrine to justify Zionist expansion. Despite the grim revelations, Sorensen ended on a hopeful note, sharing a vision of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The author and filmmaker mentioned that in a dream, he saw both groups realizing they were the same people who were guilty and needing the forgiveness of God. He added that instead of fighting, they embraced each other which is the message the world needs. Head over to Truth.news for more similar stories.

He cited statements from Israeli officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas," the incumbent Israeli leader allegedly said in 2019. "This is part of our strategy." Sorensen also referenced whistleblowers from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who claim that Israel's advanced border security systems inexplicably failed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack. This raises suspicions of a staged provocation, with the missionary journalist arguing that no military commander in his right mind would carry out such an irrational suicide mission â unless they knew retaliation was part of a larger plan. Israel's Rothschild connection and the role of satanic influence Sorensen traced Israel's origins to the Rothschild family, whom he accused of funding the state's creation as part of a satanic agenda. He pointed to the City of London's crest â featuring two dragons â as symbolic of their allegiance to dark forces. (Related:Â The history of the House ofÂ Rothschild.) "They don't even hide their Satanism,"Â he said, referencing biblical descriptions of the dragon as Satan.Â "The Rothschilds are known to be at the heads of Satanism. They are a very satanic family." A significant portion of the interview focused on Christian Zionism â a movement that unconditionally supports Israel based on theological interpretations. Sorensen added that they have hijacked Christianity to turn believers away from Christ and toward a political, militarized Israel. The filmmaker condemned this ideology as a distortion of scriptureÂ â arguing that true Israel is spiritual, not political as God never promised a military state. Christ fulfilled all prophecies, and His kingdom is within each individual. Sorensen blamed the elite-funded Scofield Study Bible for twisting Christian doctrine to justify Zionist expansion. Despite the grim revelations, Sorensen ended on a hopeful note, sharing a vision of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The author and filmmaker mentioned that in a dream, he saw both groups realizing they were the same people who were guilty and needing the forgiveness of God. He added that instead of fighting, they embraced each other which is the message the world needs. Head over to Truth.news for more similar stories.

Title: Could a nuclear war kill crypto? AI predicts Bitcoin’s fate in doomsday scenario
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/could-a-nuclear-war-kill-crypto-ai-predicts-bitcoins-fate-in-doomsday-scenario/

Polymarket odds of a nuclear bomb being dropped in 2025 was 18% – But can BTC survive? Bitcoin [BTC] has a religious following, especially for those who believe it’s a hedge against inflation and political instability, like the ongoing Israel-Iran war. But, what if it cracks in a nuclear doomsday? Many wealthy individuals, like Mexico’s richest man, Ricardo Salinas, and leaders like U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, have embraced BTC and crypto as a hedge. In fact, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, pitches BTC as a hedge equivalent or better than gold. However, AI predicts that the digital gold may not survive a nuclear apocalypse. For starters, it is crucial to understand the Bitcoin network, miners who secure it, and nodes that run the protocol to ensure transaction reliability. As of mid-2025, the network has 22,129 reachable nodes (including mining nodes) spread across the globe. Source: NewHedge According to public and official data, the U.S. controls 10.2% of BTC nodes, followed by Germany (5.8%) and France (2.6%). All the top three are nuclear powers, while China, per official data, owns only 0.15%. However, nearly 64% of nodes remained unaccounted for or unknown. Per ChatGPT, China may be controlling most of these ‘unknown’ nodes, as most of their operators opted for VPNs and went underground after the state banned BTC mining in 2021. Source: ChatGPT In a major conflict wiping out 60-80% of the internet, Bitcoin active nodes could drop from the current 22K to 1K, leading to transaction failure, alongside the proof of work (PoW) consensus. Most of the U.S. and Germany nodes would be offline for an average war, like between Russia and NATO, per ChatGPT predictions. But P2P connections could be resumed in weeks. However, a worldwide nuclear escalation would drive the network into a ‘critical failure state’, and the consensus program would stop. The above war scales and impact on the Bitcoin network would impact BTC’s value differently. But ChatGPT added that BTC pricing will be modified by other factors like market psychology and sentiment. Source: ChatGPT For a confined conflict, BTC could be viewed as a hedge, like the current Israel-Iran war. It has stayed above $100K despite the war rhetoric from leaders, including the U.S. President Donald Trump. In fact, Bitwise’s Head of Alpha Strategies reinforced this stance and recently stated, “This moment (geopolitical tensions) is why Bitcoin exists.” Meanwhile, other analysts, like QCP Capital, warned that a wider regional war could affect oil supply and global inflation, putting BTC at risk. According to ChatGPT, however, such a regional scale, involving nuclear warheads, would lead to price swings with mixed sentiment. However, in a global and total annihilation scenario, food and barter trade will be more valuable, and the internet and BTC will be dead. This is how ChatGPT charted out the above probabilities on the potential price crash for BTC. Source: ChatGPT For a localized attack, the network would remain steady, and the price could dip about 10%-30%. In fact, this is considered a normal pullback during bull markets. Per current prices, that would imply a drop to $98K-$75K. For a regional nuclear war, BTC price would crash 30%-60%, implying a potential dip to $75K-$42K as most nodes go offline. In continent-wide destruction (2-3 powers annihilated), ChatGPT projected a 60-80% decline. That would be a free fall to $42K-20K. This could be a great discount for survivors if Bitcoin survives and rallies above $100K. However, only 1000 nodes could be online, risking a protocol split or fork. But, as a survivor with no internet access, you’ll likely care about food and shelter if the entire world is nuked. In short, BTC would cease to exist as a market asset and probably tank to zero. Overall, BTC could become worthless if nukes destroy the internet and nodes. But ChatGPT highlighted that it could survive only if there is a backup in satellites with enough running nodes to keep it decentralized and secure before full re-connection later on. That said, as of June 2025, there was only an 18% chance of a nuclear bomb going off in 2025. So, it could be too early to put your nuclear war worries on BTC.

Title: Trump Is ‘Flouting the Law’ in Delaying Enforcement of TikTok Ban, Top Senate Democrat Says

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump on Thursday officially issued his third executive order delaying enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company sells a controlling stake to non-Chinese parties. Democrats said Trump’s action does not have any legal basis. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement after the White House said the president would delay enforcing the TikTok divest-or-ban law: “Once again, the Trump administration is flouting the law and ignoring its own national security findings about the risks posed by a PRC-controlled TikTok,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. Related Stories ‘Harry Potter’ HBO Series Finds Molly Weasley, Draco and Lucius Malfoy and More Hogwarts Students ‘Harry Potter’ Star Nick Frost Disagrees With J.K. Rowling’s Trans Views, Disabled Instagram Comments Amid Backlash to Working With Her: We ‘Don’t Align in Any Way’ Warner continued, “An executive order can’t sidestep the law, but that’s exactly what the president is trying to do.” Popular on Variety Republicans aren’t pleased with Trump’s continuing delays on the TikTok law, either. “That’s not my favorite thing,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) told Axios about Trump’s planned extension in a story published Thursday. “I’m fine with him trying to sell it, that’s fine, but I think at a certain point we’ve got to enforce this law.” Trump on Thursday wrote on Truth Social, “I’ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025). Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The White House had previously said he would issue such an order. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. The Trump administration has been trying to hammer out a deal that would restructure TikTok U.S.’s operations in a way that would comply with the law — while also being an arrangement the Chinese government will approve. On Thursday, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California) criticized Trump’s latest delay on the TikTok ban, writing in a post on X, “The law allows only one single extension, so Trump’s failure to enforce it is illegal.” However, in the same post, Sherman incorrectly claimed that “the Chinese owners of TikToK have announced they are buying ‘Trump Coins’ for $300 million,” which he alleged “is just a $300 million bribe that goes right into his pocket.” The official TikTok Policy account on X called out Sherman’s claim as “patently false and irresponsible.” According to a New York Times story published May 13, a company called GD Culture Group, a “struggling technology company that has ties to China and relies on TikTok,” announced that it secured funding “to buy as much as $300 million of $TRUMP, the so-called memecoin marketed by President Trump.” On a post Thursday on X from @TrumpWarRoom (described as “The official War Room account of President Donald J. Trump’s political operation”) about Trump’s latest deferment of enforcing the ban, users added a Community Note (a crowdsourced fact-checking feature of X) pointing out that the president “has no legal authority to extend the deadline another 90 days.” The Community Note cited the Supreme Court’s ruling in TikTok Inc. v. Garland upholding the law, which says: “The Act permits the President to grant a one-time extension of no more than 90 days with respect to the prohibitions’ 270-day effective date.” Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by China-based ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. TikTok said in a statement Thursday, “We are grateful for President Trump’s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance’s Office.” Warner, in advocating for passage of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill in the Senate in April 2024, said the legislation “goes a long way towards safeguarding our democratic systems from covert foreign influence.” He said Chinese companies like ByteDance “don’t owe their obligation to their customers, or their shareholders, but they owe it to the PRC government.” At a congressional hearing in March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and said there is an “inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Microsoft to lay off thousands in July, but don't worry, AI's getting $80 billion

In context: There's been plenty of talk about machines displacing human workers in the AI Age, mainly focusing on direct replacements – computers taking over tasks like design and programming. Meanwhile, spending on AI infrastructure soars as investment in human skills steadily declines. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft is preparing to lay off thousands of workers next month, with most of the cuts expected to hit the company's sales and customer service divisions. It's a jarring move but not an unfamiliar one in tech. What stands out this time is what Microsoft is doing with the money it's saving: pumping an estimated $80 billion into AI infrastructure over the next fiscal year. That number isn't a typo. As Microsoft reshapes its workforce, it's reshaping its balance sheet, too. It's laying off human employees while building new homes for silicon-based replacements – in hyperscale data centers, GPUs, and power-hungry server farms. Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to AI, but the connection is increasingly difficult to ignore. The company is investing heavily in machine learning capabilities across its entire product line, from Azure to Office. Its partnership with OpenAI and the widespread deployment of Copilot reflect a strategic pivot away from labor-intensive workflows and toward automated solutions. Despite the scale of this shift, Microsoft has offered little public indication that large-scale retraining or internal upskilling efforts are part of its AI strategy. The company clearly has the resources to help employees adapt to an AI-centric future, yet such initiatives are largely absent from its announcements and disclosures. The emphasis so far has been on infrastructure, partnerships, and AI product rollouts – not on preparing its broader workforce for the changes those investments will bring. This approach reflects a broader trend across the tech sector. Companies including Amazon, Duolingo, and Dropbox have all cited AI-driven efficiency gains when announcing workforce reductions. These moves often emphasize shareholder value and operational agility, even as they diminish opportunities for employees to transition into new roles within the organization. Microsoft plans to lay off thousands globally in the coming weeks. While the company has not disclosed exact figures, reports suggest a significant impact on customer-facing teams. These cuts underscore the shift away from labor-intensive roles as Microsoft pivots toward automation and AI-driven services. The contrast is stark: AI receives billions in dedicated capital, while workers get severance packages and uncertain futures. Microsoft isn't just betting on artificial intelligence – it's actively reorganizing its operations around it. This strategy may pay off in the long term, but it highlights a widening gap between investment in automation and support for displaced employees.

Title: Amazon To Cut 1,000 Jobs Due To AI. Now What?

ByEli Amdur ByEli Amdur, Contributor. Giant robot flicking tiny man. Ai technologies and unemployment problem concept. Vector ... More illustration. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it would cut 1,000 jobs due to AI. Is anyone surprised? The monster created by Big Tech has begun rising up to consume its creator. Well, perhaps not totally consume, but the damage done could likely be (a) measurable, (b) a harbinger of things to come at Amazon, and (c) a phenomenon we will see far and wide, not just at Amazon. It’s inescapable for a few reasons. First, according to data from layoffs.fyi, which monitors tech worker layoffs, already this year 141 companies have laid off 62,832 employees. In 2024, it was 152,922 employees from 551 companies and in 2023, it was 264,220 employees from 1,193 companies. Layoffs, we see, are inevitable – especially in tech. At the onset of new technologies or the introduction of new products, hiring takes place with kid-in-a-candy-store concern for consequences. A year later, things look quite different – and that kid is now an obese diabetic. Now, however, we see a direct cause and effect, unmistakenly traceable to AI, because AI has advanced so quickly that it is now capable of doing many of those lower, entry-level jobs we’ve long feared it could do. I am reminded of the classic line from the 1960s comic strip Pogo: “We have met the enemy and it is us.” Make no mistake, though, this is not limited to tech jobs. In May, I posted a column here, “How AI Affects The Socioeconomic Order Of The Workplace” (5/27) and here’s what we saw: Beginner programmers and coders, data analysts, junior paralegals, retail sales associates, content writers, copy editors, graphic artists, and grant writers are among the many who will deal with this reality. There’s more, but space and time have limits here. This phenomenon of jobs being eaten by AI will undoubtedly be seen at all tech companies, as they are the creators of this to begin with. But it will spread elsewhere. Picture lava streaming down an erupting volcano. But there’s a big upside to this. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will create 78 million jobs, even after job losses are factored in. So, working the math and going with aggregated and widely-accepted estimations that for every job killed by AI three or four will be created, we come to this: 78 million is the WEF’s net number, bringing us to 100 million or more, gross. Thise jobs will just not be the vulnerable entry-level jobs we’ve been discussing here. It’s complicated, no? If I were running a large company, I’d ask for a meeting. In the same room, I’d have the president of the local university or community college, my senator or congressperson, and me. I’d have one item on the agenda: those AI skills we’ve been teaching for our graduates to find their first jobs need to be relegated to high school and forever be seen as obsolete. AI will forever do them. Next, define the next level of AI jobs and teach them as the new entry level, while teaching other skills – communication, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. – that our new employees would have been developing on he way up. We are past throwing our hands in the air. This is no longer something new or mysterious. “Success delayed is success denied,” said Ben Franklin. We just simply must take the first step.

Title: The Big Picture: Streaming and Social Media Climb Amid Traditional Media’s Slow-Motion Breakdown

Time Published: 2025-06-19T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
The headlines all point toward the decline of linear and traditional models, with the nagging question of whether new means of distribution can pick up the slack Traditional media is experiencing what often feels like a slow-motion nervous breakdown, which would hardly come as news to anyone operating in the thick of that. Yet occasionally a week comes along with ostensibly distinct stories that help crystallize the larger picture, almost like the cop finally piecing things together at the end of “The Usual Suspects.” In just the last few days, a handful of reports speak to trends that coalesce into a single clarifying moment: Old media is limping along on wobbly legs, if not its death bed yet, and efforts to save it are merely prolonging the inevitable. A shift in consumption patterns for entertainment, news and information has hamstrung many long-established means of disseminating content, while pushing newer forms to the forefront. Clocking each of these developments as they fly by — sometimes while on the move ourselves, increasingly via our phones — the connections aren’t always obvious. So let’s pause for a breath and take inventory of this week’s media news, and the changing of the guard that it reveals. Part of that shift has been driven by YouTube, and as if on cue: Shorter version: Teens and young adults (especially) are spending less time watching movies and TV shows, while allocating more to snippets of video and getting their news from TikTok, not those stodgy cable networks watched by their parents and grandparents. But wait, there’s more. Netflix unveiled a groundbreaking deal Wednesday to carry the output from French broadcaster TF1, an agreement TF1 Group CEO Rodolphe Belmer described in its announcement as becoming necessary “as viewing habits shift toward on-demand consumption and audience fragmentation increases” — a trend that has crossed international borders. Finally, Amazon issued a memo that served as a not-so-subtle warning to its employees about the impact of artificial intelligence, noting there will be layoffs associated with AI picking up tasks performed by actual humans, while offering the only modestly reassuring aside that some new jobs will be created as a byproduct of that shift. So basically, “Get on board, or get out of the way.” Although frankly, a host of recent headlines have made clear AI’s impact remains unpredictable enough that it won’t necessarily spare early adopters either, in the same way monsters in old movies frequently kill the mad scientist that unleashes them first. The main problem, grappled with since the transition from print to online and more recently the great migration to streaming that began with the launch of multiple services (including Disney+ and Apple TV+) in 2019, is the uncertainty about when these lines will intersect — whether newer revenue streams can supplant old ones, such as linear TV, before those models slide off a cliff. The newspaper industry dealt with that game of digital chicken first, as the web gobbled up its classified advertising business and distribution of print editions, falling victim to those forces despite the alarm bells sounded about trading in “print dollars for digital dimes.” Although most legacy publications have managed to survive, with a few notable exceptions like the New York Times, it’s generally in dramatically scaled-down form, both in terms of the size of their staffs and the scope of their ambitions. Step back a little further, and it’s easy to weave more pixels into the picture, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal’s spinoffs of their declining cable assets, and whether the economies of scale associated with mergers and acquisitions can be enough to justify anteing up for an entity whose trend lines point in the wrong direction. In “The Usual Suspects,” the messy cop defends his scattered work area by telling a colleague, “It all makes sense when you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.” In the daily scramble of these jobs, including the race to cover these stories, it can be difficult to take the time to seek perspective or try connecting the dots, making things appear messier, even chaotic. Whether the view is from up close or gains clarity from far away, though, the prospects for traditional media don’t paint a comforting picture.

Title: How Online Businesses Are Winning Customers With AI Agents In 2025

ByAytekin Tank ByAytekin Tank, Contributor. Photo by Christopher Gower on Unsplash If you scroll through Instagram stories these days, you might notice something: photos of vacations, engagements, and kids’ birthdays are giving way to targeted ads. They’re not there just to spam you—they actually work. The old shopping journey looked like this: need → search → buy. Today, that flow has flipped. People often make purchases without ever intending to shop in the first place. Using the latest technologies, brands match products to individuals, and customers end up buying things they didn’t even know they needed, like a lightweight enamel mug for that camping trip you just booked. Now, AI agents are pushing the next big shift in e-commerce. These tools promise to transform the customer journey yet again. Brands that don’t get on board risk losing valuable opportunities (and sales). The fact is: consumer expectations are evolving. By 2030, over 55% of purchases will be influenced by AI-friendly buyers, according to research from Cognizant. As CEO of a company that builds AI agents—and uses them internally—I’ve seen how powerful they can be. Here’s how your business can tap into them to boost sales and level up the customer experience. Many years ago, when I built my first website, adding e-commerce functionality was a Byzantine process. I needed an experienced web developer to help hammer out the details. Today, platforms like Shopify make it easy and affordable for businesses of any size to sell online. And now, AI agents are making customizable storefronts even more accessible. When you install an agent like Juphy, Smartbot, or Shopify Sidekick, it will train itself using your business’s data. You can decide what the agent does and how it interacts with customers. If you want it to handle customer service, you can assign it a support phone number and instruct it to answer calls. If your business serves multiple countries, your agent can translate webpages and offer support in different languages. You can also choose which pop-ups to display to guide users as they browse and shop. What’s more, you can set it all up without writing a single line of code. A growing number of startups are taking the guesswork out of visual design as well. Phot.AI, for example, is an agent platform that independently handles tasks like image editing and design for e-commerce brands. Its agents learn which designs perform best for different product categories and marketplaces, reducing manual effort and costs for business owners by up to 80%. AI agents are like designing the brick-and-mortar store of your dreams, but without needing an architect or interior designer. AI agents make it easier than ever to design and customize your e-commerce site. But what about the experience on the other side of the screen? Research shows that 75% of buyers find online shopping frustrating. If you’ve ever sworn off e-commerce after a botched return or an endless gift search, you’re not alone. Maybe the shoes you ordered for a wedding arrived two sizes too big, and the return process was cumbersome. Or perhaps you set out to buy your nephew a birthday present and got lost down the rabbit hole of Nintendo Switch options. This is where AI-powered assistants come in. Agents can guide shoppers step-by-step, smoothing over the snags that often jam up the purchase journey. They answer questions, like what to buy, when it will arrive, and whether it fits the budget. And over time, they learn a buyer’s preferences: goals, timing, history, and price sensitivity. For instance, if you need that present for your 12-year-old nephew by Friday, an agent will intuit that a digital gift card to his favorite gaming store, delivered instantly, is the best option. Even if the product search has gone off without a snag, one glitch in the process, like a question or concern that pops up and doesn’t receive immediate attention, can mar the entire experience. As Scott Hendrickson, chief revenue officer of the agentic AI merchant network firmly, recently noted, “What consumers really want is for commerce to happen immediately. People’s time has never been more valuable, and they expect things to be frictionless.” Integrating AI agents into your e-commerce site can help transactions become frictionless. Agents are ready to answer questions around the clock, 24/7. An agent can engage in natural, responsive, human-sounding conversations, ensuring potential customers never slip through the cracks due to unanswered calls. And because they are linked directly to the back-end of your business—data, inventory, and more—you can rest assured that the information it provides will be up-to-date. It won’t offer unrealistic shipping timelines, only to frustrate disappointed customers. It won’t suggest products that aren’t in stock. But if a product is out of stock, it will suggest alternatives based on the buyer’s preferences and history. And as your business grows, agents are a cost-effective solution to help manage all of the business parts that grow in tandem, like more products, more customers, and a higher volume of transactions. In short, AI agents help scale your business, ensuring every customer interaction is fast, informed, and friction-free.

Title: Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines. The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc’s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. The company has raised a total of $2 billion, according to PitchBook. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In an General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Microsoft is gearing up for another round of layoffs, with plans to cut thousands of jobs with a specific focus on its sales workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg reports that technology giant Microsoft is preparing to trim its workforce once again, with the latest round of job cuts expected to be announced in early July, following the close of the company’s fiscal year. Sources close to the situation revealed that the layoffs will predominantly impact sales positions, although other teams may also be affected. The exact timing of the announcement could still change. This news comes on the heels of a previous wave of layoffs in May, which involved 6,000 employees losing their jobs, primarily in product and engineering roles. The customer-facing positions, such as sales and marketing, were largely spared during that round of cuts. In April, Microsoft informed employees of its intention to rely more heavily on third-party firms for the sale of software to small and medium-sized businesses, potentially foreshadowing the upcoming reductions in the sales force. As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, spending tens of billions of dollars on servers and data centers, executives have pledged to Wall Street and cautioned employees that the company will maintain a tight grip on spending in other areas. The company has stated that it regularly assesses its organizational structure to ensure it is allocating resources effectively for growth. At the end of June 2024, Microsoft had a total of 228,000 employees, with 45,000 of them working in sales and marketing positions. The company has a history of restructuring teams and announcing other organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. Breitbart News previously reported on a significant layoff in January that impacted the company’s security division: One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 30-year-old Shahad Ishraq, from Germany. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Reading Andy Jassy's new memo on generative AI, I'm not surprised by anything. I worked at Amazon for nearly 3 ½ years and left in late May because of the five-day return-to-office mandate. My commute took an hour and a half each way, so I wanted to move to another job where I could still see my career progressing and do interesting work. The memo feels consistent with what I'd been hearing from management and Jassy while working at Amazon. I think Jassy's comments are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. I initially worried about AI when I wasn't as familiar with the products. However, using AI will give you a better understanding of what it's capable of and what skills you can develop to differentiate yourself. I joined Amazon in 2022 as a systems development engineer, working in Leipzig, Germany. My day-to-day work involved designing and implementing software and performing operational tasks. When AI tools first came out a few years ago, we were told we could use them, but we should be very careful and follow the company's policies on their usage. Amazon is a huge company. Within it, I spotted and heard about different approaches to AI adoption. There seemed to be a bunch of excited early adopters who shared their findings with everyone. There were people like me who followed the first bunch and saw what went well. There were also some skeptics and a small number of engineers who were outright against using AI. For me, the dawn of AI was a bit scary at first. Everyone was saying it would put me out of a job. Unless you test the technology yourself and see what it can do, you'll fear the unknown. AI wasn't part of my job until sometime in 2024. There were also some barriers to using the technology. When I first joined Amazon, ChatGPT wasn't even available, but when it did come out in 2022, we couldn't use it that extensively because of data security issues that come with copying our code into those models. When Anthropic's Claude became available within Amazon Bedrock — the company's internal service for developing generative AI applications — we were able to make more use of AI. In my last few months at Amazon, I started experimenting a lot with approved AI tools, doing extensive tests with them. They don't do everything for me, but I've integrated these tools into my workflow, such as by asking it to create a plan for my tasks or spot differences between documents. I noticed it often fails, and I have to make changes, but overall, it has improved my speed and increased my throughput significantly. Andy Jassy's memo feels very consistent with what I've been told internally before I left Amazon and what the company has communicated publicly. News articles talking about the memo focus on Jassy saying that a lot of jobs will be taken by AI. However, in the same sentence, he also says jobs will be created. I've tried creating production-level applications using AI, and it takes a lot of effort to get these products ready. A company like Amazon can't roll out an application that breaks and causes havoc. They have to have firewalls, checks, and tests. I don't see people going out of jobs in huge numbers soon. Amazon went on a hiring spree during COVID. If we see more layoffs, I think it will be associated with cutting back after that spree, rather than the impacts of AI. AI agents are helping out software engineers a lot, and the amount of work agents do will probably increase gradually. I'm able to get agents working on three different things, while I look into other tasks. But AI hallucinates quite a lot. It does things it's not asked to do. I often have to correct an AI agent producing code. Humans will be required to build guardrails and act as guardrails themselves. Implementing these guardrails will take time, and I think this will slow down the AI agent hype. I think Jassy's comments about AI are to show shareholders he's invested in the technology. Memos have to come out. Jassy has to place a lot of optimism around AI; otherwise, shareholders will think they're not doing anything with AI. My advice to Amazon employees is to start using AI as much as possible to overcome their fear of the unknown. I now work as a software engineer at a utilities company. The more I've been using AI, the more comfortable I feel about myself. I can see what skills I have that I can use to stay relevant. In tech, languages and developments come really fast. My guess is that people will need to use AI to write code and increase their throughput, and pure software engineers will gradually be replaced by people who have both software engineering and AI skills. I'm personally trying to learn these skills because I think they'll become more important. A spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider: "Amazon employees use internal generative AI tools every day to innovate on behalf of our customers. We have safeguards in place for employee use of these technologies, including restrictions on sharing confidential information with third-party generative AI services."

Title: America Plants The Flag As The Crypto Capital Of The World

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. The US plants the crypto flag America is rapidly emerging as the “crypto capital of the world” since Donald Trump won the presidential election and adopted pro-crypto policies. Such a crypto-friendly ecosystem is propelling American companies to further champion and develop innovative DeFi products and expand their investor base into larger pools of global institutional capital. This week the Senate approved the GENIUS Act, groundbreaking stablecoin legislation, by 68-30 votes, a convincing margin that signals deeper than expected bipartisan support towards good crypto and digital assets legislation and signalling America’s political commitment to digital innovation in the finance sector. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and one of the key sponsors of the bill, said in a statement, “The GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar.” It is considered by many market pundits that U.S. dollar backed stablecoins will defend and even extend the dollar’s dominance just as it is in the spotlight with central bankers from Europe to China expressing their views on new challenges to dollar dominance. The prospect of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations has been mooted, and asset owners outside of the U.S. now publicly admit they have been overweight in their U.S. equity and debt positions for more than a decade of solid U.S. market performance, driven by U.S. technology over the past 20 years like the MAG7. Now, new digital asset innovators are leading the way. Circle’s IPO earlier this month debuted on NYSE at $31 and is now trading at over $200, a breathtaking performance, helping to break trail for crypto companies lining up to IPO including Kraken and Bullish. The crypto treasury playbook, made famous by Michael Saylor at Strategy (MSTR) has also seen a number IPOs including Sol Strategies Inc. (HODL.CN), DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV), Upexi (UPXI), Metaplanet Inc. (MTPLF) and many more. These “pubcos” are a niche class of publicly-traded companies available to all investors which serve as proxies by investing in major tokens like bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force organized its last roundtable on June 9, titled “DeFi and the American Spirit.” The SEC Chairman, Paul S. Atkins’s comments at the event have drawn widespread attention for aligning DeFi’s philosophy with American values. Atkins said, “The American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi movement, and importantly, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet.” He further added, “I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially when intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.” According to Statista, the United States generates the highest revenue in the DeFi market globally, with an annual growth rate of 3.59%. Atkins’s positive sentiment toward DeFi and positioning it at the core of America’s value system will provide a further boost to the industry. Wendy Fu, ceo and co-founder at Momentum and a founding member of the Libra project at Meta said, “The SEC Chair’s statements at the roundtable have provided a much-needed regulatory clarity to DeFi protocols, but this is just the beginning. Atkins’s statements also reflect the SEC’s ‘century-old regulatory frameworks’ are out of sync with current innovations and require further updates to suit DeFi’s needs.” Currently, the SEC’s rules are based on traditional “issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies.” The drafters of such regulations didn’t consider how self-executing software code like DeFi’s smart contracts would eventually displace the intermediaries. Paul Atkins has asked the SEC staff to explore amendments, seek guidance, and frame rules that may be necessary for new companies to comply. This will “eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity.” The SEC’s DeFi roundtable has supercharged the DeFi sector with tokens like Compound (COMP), Uniswap (UNI), and Aave (AAVE) surging in prices. Besides DeFi’s bullish momentum, crypto companies and legacy firms are exploring IPOs and Bitcoin treasuries to diversify their balance sheets and onboard new investors. On March 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump passed an executive order for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile. This gave a massive boost to private companies to establish Bitcoin corporate treasuries (BCTs), functioning as acquisition vehicles and operating companies. But companies must assess whether they want to accumulate USD or BTC to customize their trading and Bitcoin retention approach. Companies holding substantial BTC reserves diversify their offerings, such as Strategy rolling out debt and convertible instruments to address different capital markets investors. A BTC pubco’s goal is to generate a strong derivatives market with sufficient volume to offer low-risk participation for institutional investors. For fixed income and private credit companies, a derivatives market facilitates purchasing debt and capturing delta using short futures and options to offset long exposure. For example, Strategy deployed this combination to ensure a fundraising success with 0% debt. Similarly, companies like Nakamoto raised $710 million for their Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) because the company wants to launch more pubcos globally. Nakamoto follows Strategy’s business plans and has been involved with Metaplanet and other listed companies. This enables Nakamoto to offer efficient centralized services and tap into foreign capital markets that have limitations in accessing other BCTs. Since adopting BCT, Strategy’s stock has gained 2,800% with a market capitalization of almost $102 billion. On the other hand, crypto-native companies like Circle have recently forayed into the public markets, making a strong debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 5, 2025. Circle’s shares jumped 235% on the first trading session as the company’s market performance indicates a growing appetite for stablecoins. Amidst massive investor interest, Circle upsized its IPO to $1.05 billion and sold 34 million shares at $31 each. Naman Kabra, founder and ceo of NodeOps, reacted to the market performance, explaining, “Circle's IPO success shows investors and users care about crypto’s real-world use cases and will actively participate if it makes sense to them. Thus, it’s our responsibility to build robust infrastructure, but abstract the technology away from users, so they can only focus on usability.” Public markets are ready for crypto-native companies demonstrating strong revenue charts, robust compliance, and scalable infrastructure. It’s high time we focus on developing cost-efficient, low-latency infrastructure that suits the needs and demands of investors. No wonder popular crypto exchanges like Kraken are preparing for their IPO in 2026 after the SEC dropped its case against them. But Kraken is already reaching out to retail investors by offering tokenized RWAs to US and non-US investors. Since April 14, 2025, Kraken has enabled exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized stock trading to US clients from select states. But it is now planning to offer tokenized American stocks to non-US customers, thereby opening up investments in traditional assets via tokenization. The RWA tokenization market has grown massively and is projected to reach $30 trillion by 2030. Kraken’s set of microservices aims to take on larger brokerages like Robinhood, as institutional and retail interest continues to surge. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, Ripple and XRP Ledger (XRPL) will also play an important role in tokenizing private equity (PE). The report cites the $1 billion tokenized PE and debt fund launched on XRP Ledger by Aurum Equity Partners to demonstrate how tokenization will improve the efficiency and accessibility of traditional assets. Unique Divine, co-founder and ceo at Nibiru says, “RWA tokenization isn’t simply theoretical. The RWA market has already grown from $8.6 billion in 2024 to over $24 billion in one year, driven by demand for more efficient access to yield-bearing assets. And giant institutions like BlackRock are taking it seriously." The U.S. federal government has already laid the groundwork to develop innovative crypto products with an accommodating and regulatory-friendly approach. With a new Markets Structure Bill in the making, the U.S. is likely to write the playbook for digital assets, and in a shorter period of time than other jurisdictions. Now it’s time for crypto companies to leverage the opportunity and break out of their bubble to bring new investors into the crypto industry and greater market access to products that have shown a firm demand across all segments of the market.

Title: Amazon is apparently forcing some workers to relocate to its main office hubs

Amazon updates its office-working policy once again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is requiring some corporate workers to relocate closer to their managers and teams, targeting cities like Seattle, Arlington and Washington DC (via Bloomberg). The report notes thousands of employees could be forced to move from across various teams, however the company's famously vocal workers are understandably frustrated with the decision. Amazon has been reassessing where employees work for several months, with the company's leader publicly advocating for office-based working. Although relocating isn't always a problem for new starters, many mid-career workers are hesitant to move due to personal and financial challenges – a move would mean uprooting families, children switching schools and partners seeking other jobs. The report suggests that workers have 30 days to decide, followed by a 60-day period to relocate or resign. It also claims that those who refuse to relocate will not be receiving severance packages. Amazon contested this, adding that teammates will receive relocation support, and that timelines for relocations could vary by case. Amazon's relocation trend has already been ongoing for more than a year, with CEO Andy Jassy previously claiming that in-person working boost ad-hoc interactions and, therefore, productivity.

"We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," Jassy said. Amazon now requires workers to come to the office five days per week, but that policy got delayed at the end of 2024 due to a lack of readiness – there simply weren't enough desks. "We hear from the majority of our teammates that they love the energy from being located together, and whenever someone chooses to or is asked to relocate, we work with them to offer support based on their individual circumstances," a company spokesperson stated. Some workers worry that the policy shift could be an effort to push workers away from the company – although thousands lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023, Amazon's layoffs in the years that followed have been relatively small (compared with other giants in the industry). An Amazon spokesperson stressed that the policy is not new, but that it's taking a team-by-team approach to in-office working, and that relative to the number of workers the company has overall, the proportion affected is small.

Title: Microsoft to cut thousands more jobs, mainly in sales

Microsoft is set to cut thousands of jobs, mainly in sales, amid growing fears that AI advances are accelerating the replacement of human roles across the industry, Bloomberg reports. The cuts follow a previous round in May, which saw approximately 6,000 roles eliminated. Microsoft has been ramping up its AI investments to strengthen its position as enterprises across industries rush to integrate the technology into their operations. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend around $80 billion in fiscal 2025, largely on building data centers to support AI training and cloud-based applications. Adding to industry unease, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week that generative AI and AI agents are expected to shrink the company’s corporate workforce over time. AI is being used as an excuse for layoffs this year, but there may be more to it than what meets the eye. “One, we are still rebalancing employee counts from the over-hiring of the past decade,” said Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst of Amalgam Insights. “Tech companies were hiring with the assumption that they would grow at ridiculous rates that have not come to pass. Also, some tech companies think they can simply get rid of salespeople, especially in cash-cow industries where renewals seem to come in with little to no effort. Whether that is actually true or not, we are about to find out.”The job cuts may also signal concerns about the near-term revenue potential of AI, Park said. While Microsoft is under pressure to invest heavily in AI to sustain its stock valuation, it may be turning to short-term operating expense reductions to support its financial performance. “The planned $80 billion investment in AI infrastructure is especially interesting because those numbers assume a massive number of people will adopt Microsoft-related AI products,” Park said. “Are 50 million+ people willing to pay an additional amount on Microsoft products to support AI? That is a massive bet that has been completely unjustified by the current AI market today.”Others point out that the company is betting on a long-term inflection in enterprise workload patterns driven by GenAI, but current adoption patterns remain volatile. “Reports of Microsoft pausing or renegotiating data center leases reflect a prudent but necessary response to these uncertainties,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “If workloads fail to scale or regulatory barriers increase, Microsoft, and by extension, other hyperscalers, could face underutilized infrastructure, prompting pricing recalibrations or service tier stratification.” The focus on sales roles in the planned cuts is notable, with analysts saying it reflects a broader shift in how enterprise sales functions are evolving. “The rise of AI copilots, telemetry-rich self-service portals, and data-driven journey mapping is reducing the need for large in-region sales teams,” Gogia said. “Microsoft’s realignment is part of a broader pattern also visible in Amazon, Google, and Salesforce.” However, while AI can personalize interactions at scale, it lacks the relational depth required in strategic deal-making, compliance negotiation, and multi-stakeholder orchestration, Gogia added.

Microsoft is planning to cut thousands of jobs in the next few weeks, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the plans. Details about the layoffs are scarce, but Bloomberg says it will be announced early next month once Microsoft’s fiscal year ends. The cuts will impact multiple departments, but Microsoft's sales team is expected to take the biggest hit. The report arrives just a month after Microsoft removed 6,000 jobs across various departments and seniority levels. It was done to reduce management layers and “best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft said at the time. As of June 2024, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, and 45,000 of them were in sales and marketing. According to Bloomberg, the previous round of layoffs had largely left the sales and marketing teams untouched. In April, however, the company informed employees that it plans to use third-party firms for the marketing of software to small and mid-size customers. This strategy could help Microsoft reduce operational costs by relying on gig workers for short-term campaigns instead of full-time staff. Microsoft has also vowed to invest over $80 billion in data centers for AI development, but it’s unclear if that has anything to do with the back-to-back layoffs. The months ahead may be tough for tech workers, with more layoffs looming across major firms. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just announced that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer. Intel is also planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles.

Title: Canadian Pension Doubles Down on Green Investing With $400 Billion Pledge

(Bloomberg) -- La Caisse, one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, is doubling down on its sustainable investing targets after meeting its goals for this year earlier than expected. The pension fund, whose full name is Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, pledged on Thursday to invest $400 billion by the end of the decade in companies committed to decarbonizing their operations and in climate solutions such as low-carbon technologies. “We are reaffirming our sustainable investing convictions because they are at the heart of our fiduciary responsibility,” Charles Emond, president and chief executive officer of La Caisse, said in a statement. La Caisse is encouraging companies it invests in to adopt “clear and credible” decarbonization plans “with a view to long-term value creation and sound risk management for our depositors,” he said. The decision comes amid a fraught political backdrop for sustainable investing. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has dropped its pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Royal Bank of Canada scrapped its sustainable finance commitments in April, just months after leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. As recently as last week, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, said it will shut several US-based sustainable funds. Political support for fossil fuels in Canada means pension funds “will be challenged in their efforts to make smart investment decisions” that account for risks from oil and gas, Shift, a sustainable investment advocacy group, wrote in its quarterly pension report. Bertrand Millot, the head of sustainability at La Caisse, said in an interview that its strategy is rooted in financial rather than altruistic motivations. “We aren’t doing this to save the planet. We are doing this to make money. That is very, very important,” Millot said. There is reason to be bullish about the long-term value of the energy transition, according to Vinay Shandal, global head of sustainable investing at Boston Consulting Group. That’s because it isn’t only important from a climate perspective; it’s also a driver of energy security, industrial competitiveness and access to critical minerals, he said. La Caisse isn’t alone in Canada in sticking with sustainable investments: Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board said it’s moving ahead with its long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions from its investment activities by 2050. Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System said it’s committed to annual measuring and reporting on its path to net zero by 2050. At British Columbia Investment Management Corp., climate change considerations remain a cornerstone of the investment process, said Jennifer Coulson, BCI’s global head of ESG. “As one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, we continue to leverage our size and ownership rights to actively manage climate-related risks and opportunities in our portfolio, including through engagement, proxy voting, and policy advocacy,” she said.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2025/06/19/the-2025-forbes-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With a remit spanning marketing, communications, insights and product design, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands.

With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With a remit spanning marketing, communications, insights and product design, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation.

She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years.

Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Korber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With a remit spanning marketing, communications, insights and product design, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion.

She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands.

This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale.

At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Korber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round.

Title: Property prices surge for 20th month in a row piling pressure on new buyers

Stock image Property prices rose again in April, pilling more pressure on new buyers trying to secure a home. It was the 20th month in a row of rising home values. Prices were up by 7.5pc in the year to April, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This was compared with a rise of 7.6pc in the year to March. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.2pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.6pc compared with April last year. The median price of home bought in the period across the State was €365,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €185,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to April was A94 in Blackrock, Dublin, with a median price of €750,000. Castlerea, in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In April, 3,748 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These purchases were made up of 2,908 existing dwellings and 840 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,458 first-time buyer purchases in April 2025. In the year to April, 49,352 homes were bought by households at market prices were filed with Revenue. Of these, 18,146 were purchased by first time buyer owner-occupiers. This works out at 37pc of the purchases. Former owner-occupiers purchased 25,907 homes, or 52.5pc of the total. The balance of 5,299 (10.7pc) were acquired by non-occupiers, such as State-supported housing charities and funds. The latest price rises are in the wake of the Central Bank again reducing its forecast of how many houses will be built this year, saying it now expects 32,500 – just 2,000 more than last year. It is the second time this year that the bank has reduced its housing forecast. In March, it lowered the prediction to 35,000 from 37,000. The latest development will heap further pressure on the Government, which has set itself a target of delivering 41,000 homes this year, which now seems unattainable. Even that target is less than what most housing experts say is needed to meet demand and clear the backlog – about 52,000 units a year. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. The banking lobby group said 17pc consumers in Ireland, or almost one in five, report that they were looking to rent or buy. This is according to the February 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey.

Don’t be fooled by the bipartisan buzz — the Genius Act is a Trojan horse for centralized power, digital surveillance, and ESG-backed financial control. America is on the edge of a financial cliff, and Washington’s so-called “solution” is yet another clever ploy that could further centralize power and lead to a reduction in freedom. The latest scheme is a bipartisan bill dubbed the Genius Act. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on Tuesday by a vote of 68-30. The bill now moves on to the House, where its prospects are less clear. It’s time for the right to sound the alarm and reject the Genius Act — at least until it offers protections for individual liberty. Supporters of the law claim it will modernize digital finance by issuing new regulations for stablecoins, shoring up assets currently used by millions of people worldwide. But the legislation comes with serious threats to liberty as well. It could ultimately become a backdoor way to create a digital dollar, one that offers minimal privacy protections and is easily controlled by massive institutions unaccountable to voters. Officially named the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,” the Genius Act aims to bring order and credibility to the booming stablecoin market. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tied to supposedly “stable” assets like the U.S. dollar. USD Coin and Tether — two of the most widely used — circulate more than $200 billion combined. The bill creates a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, allowing them to operate under either state or federal supervision. Lawmakers believe this approach will boost credibility with consumers and financial institutions. The legislation also forces issuers to disclose their reserve assets, submit to public audits, and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. That law requires financial entities to implement know-your-customer protocols and anti-money-laundering measures — rules that many stablecoin issuers currently avoid. Most importantly, the Genius Act would force issuers to back their coins with liquid assets, such as U.S. dollars and Treasury securities. For example, for every USD Coin distributed, the issuer would need to maintain $1 in reserves or Treasury bills of equivalent value, ensuring that users can always exchange their stablecoins for dollars. The Genius Act has drawn broad bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers from both parties praise its regulatory ambitions. But behind the applause lie serious risks. The bill lays the foundation for a programmable digital currency system — one that lacks basic protections for privacy and liberty. By granting stablecoins federal recognition and placing them under strict oversight and reserve rules, the Genius Act effectively turns them into government-blessed digital dollars, even if the federal government doesn’t issue them directly. That might sound like progress — if the bill actually protected consumers. But it doesn’t. The legislation includes no safeguards to prevent stablecoin issuers from linking usage to social credit systems, such as ESG scores, or restricting legal but politically disfavored transactions. These programmable currencies could easily reflect the ideological preferences of their creators. RELATED: A brutal wake-up call from America’s most powerful banker Photo by Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Want to donate to a political cause that a stablecoin company opposes? Expect a digital roadblock. Want to buy red meat, a gas-powered car, or anything else that fails to meet an ESG benchmark? Your money might simply stop working. That’s not science fiction. That’s the likely outcome if Congress fails to add robust consumer protections to the Genius Act. No one needs to use stablecoins — at least not yet. The Genius Act doesn’t eliminate traditional dollars. For now, consumers still have alternatives. But that could change quickly. Stablecoins regulated by the U.S. government offer clear advantages over traditional currency. They move instantly, cost little or nothing to send, and operate around the clock. Because they’re digital, they require no physical infrastructure to create or distribute. In nearly every respect, government-regulated stablecoins outperform paper money. Once the U.S. government legitimizes them and guarantees their safety, adoption will surge. As usage grows, demand for traditional dollars could shrink. The companies issuing stablecoins would gain enormous control over economic life. Financial institutions could even begin phasing out physical currency, leaving those who resist digital money with no practical alternative. That’s why Congress must include strong protections for individual liberty in any bill that accelerates stablecoin adoption. Without those safeguards, Americans may one day wake up to find their economic freedom coded out of existence. One of the primary reasons so many in Washington support the Genius Act is that it would increase demand for Treasury bills, which helps the federal government finance its massive debt. The Genius Act would require stablecoin issuers to back their currencies with cash or U.S. Treasurys. Of the two options, Treasury bills often make more sense for the companies issuing stablecoins. Why? Because Treasury bills pay interest. Washington is drowning in red ink. With over $36 trillion in national debt and counting, the government desperately needs someone to keep buying its IOUs. Stablecoins could offer a trillion-dollar solution. By 2028, the Treasury Department estimates that stablecoin issuers could hold up to $1 trillion in Treasurys, so long as legislation like the Genius Act becomes law. The Genius Act isn’t primarily about innovation. It’s about bailing out a bankrupt government. Even more troubling is who stands to benefit. Major players behind these stablecoins include BlackRock, Fidelity, and other financial giants with deep ties to the globalist ESG agenda and organizations like the World Economic Forum. These aren’t neutral actors. They are ideological enforcers with an appetite for control. Are these the people we want managing the digital currency of the future? Are these the institutions we trust to safeguard our freedoms? It’s time for the right to sound the alarm and reject the Genius Act — at least until it offers protections for individual liberty. If we do not act now, we may soon find ourselves in a nation where every transaction is tracked, every purchase scrutinized, and every dollar you “own” is merely rented from a system that can revoke your access with the flick of a switch.

Title: Microsoft reportedly set to cut thousands of jobs, with sales roles particularly at risk

Microsoft is warming up for more redundancies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is preparing to cut thousands of jobs as part of its ongoing cost-cutting shakeup as the company continues to spend big on AI. A new Bloomberg report says if confirmed, the layoffs could be announced in early July after the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year end on June 30, 2025. Sales teams could be the worst affected, but the redundancies could span other departments as Microsoft looks to reduce employment-related expenses. The company has already cut thousands of workers off in these post-pandemic years. In May 2025, it cut 6,000 of its workers, equating to around 3% of its roughly 228,000 headcount, in an effort to reduce inefficiencies by removing middle management tiers. A further 305 workers lost their jobs this month, with 14,000 roles affected in 2023 and 2024. In April 2025, Microsoft said it would outsource sales to small and mid-sized customers to third-party firms – an indication of the changes believed to be coming as soon as next month. Despite widespread job losses, Microsoft continues to perform well financially. Last quarter, it reported a 13% increase in revenue to $70.1 billion. It currently holds the title of the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.569 trillion. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! At the time, CFO Amy Hood stated that overall company headcount was 2% up year-over-year, but slightly down quarter-over-quarter, suggesting constant fluctuations. TechRadar Pro has asked Microsoft to confirm plans to lay off workers after the current quarter draws to a close, but we did not receive an immediate response. While highly disappointing for the company's workers, Microsoft employees aren't alone in facing job uncertainty. Key rivals like Amazon and Google have also been making regular adjustments to their headcounts to optimize costs and output.

Workplace Savings was launched to help workers build stronger financial resilience by allowing them to contribute to savings directly as they earn. Over half a million UK workers are now using Wagestream's savings product to save for the first time. This easy access product has an industry leading interest rate of 4.33% and is now broadening its scope to allow external deposits for the first time. Clients in the early access programme went live this week, enabling members to transfer in deposits from their linked bank accounts for easy consolidation of their savings. This feature will be made available to all clients from early July. Katie Duxbury, Head of Pay Services & Wellbeing Benefits at BUPA, shared: "Longer term we can see our employees building saving pots and reversing their money story, moving from borrowers to savers with all the positive mental health benefits that financial resilience brings." One in six UK adults have no savings, and a third have £500 or less. With the traditional financial system stacked against 80% of the working world, those on lower incomes are usually the hardest hit. Workplace Savings was created to change that structure. Partnering with Investec, Wagestream is able to offer this market leading product with no minimum deposit or fees to its members, which is usually reserved for high income earners. Employees have the option to save a monthly fixed amount, or they can switch on Save the Pennies, which rounds down each worker's shift pay to the nearest pound, and adds the difference to their savings. Wagestream first launched in 2018, entering the banking movement with a flexible pay solution, which allowed employees to access and withdraw their pay as they earned it. Fast forward seven years, and it has evolved into a holistic financial wellbeing provider – from flexible pay and high interest savings products, to affordable loans, budgeting, coaching and financial education services. Wagestream is at the forefront of this major shift in the employee–employer relationship, as financial services move beyond traditional institutions into the workplace. Peter Briffett, CEO of Wagestream, said: "With the launch of external deposits, we are entering a new era of next generation workplace financial products. This is just the beginning of the revolution, as we continue to impact the lives of millions of people, with fairer financial services." So far, £38 million has been saved by Wagestream members, providing them with more opportunities for growth, freedom and resilience in their day to day lives. Backed by a social charter and the mission to reduce the poverty premium, Wagestream currently serves more than three million members across 2000+ employer brands. This announcement comes on the back of Wagestream recently announcing a £300 million debt financing facility provided by Citi, to expand the Workplace Loans product to its UK member base. World-leading impact investors, Better Society Capital, Social Tech Trust and Fair By Design, along with renowned venture capital investors, Balderton Capital, Northzone, QED, Smash Capital, BlackRock and British Business Bank, have all invested in Wagestream. About Wagestream: Globally, 3 million people now have Wagestream membership through 2,000 brands – across the U.K., Europe and U.S. – making it the world's most widely-used financial wellbeing provider. Offered through employers, the platform attracts more than 12 million monthly visits, helping members to earn, learn, save, spend and borrow on their own terms, all in one smartphone app. Wagestream is a B corporation, built with a social charter to provide fair financial services.

Title: Report: Microsoft to Lay Off Thousand of Employees Early Next Month

Microsoft is reportedly planning to lay off thousands of employees early next month following the closure of its 2025 fiscal year. According to a report from Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter, the layoffs will mostly impact sales team, though the timing of the announcement could still change. In May, Microsoft already laid off 3 percent of its workforce, with the job cuts affecting approximately 6,000 people. In January, the company also laid off employees working on security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming.

"*" indicates required fields Δ It’s not uncommon for Microsoft to axe jobs or sunset unprofitable services at the beginning of a new fiscal year. Currently, the company is also investing heavily in developing its AI infrastructure, and it is on track to spend over $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year. Unfortunately, Microsoft’s recent job cuts in May primarily affected software engineers, as up to 30% of the code for some of the company’s projects is now being written by AI. And the Redmond giant isn’t the only Big Tech company to reduce its workforce amid the ongoing AI boom. In a note to employees shared on Tuesday (via the Wall Street Journal), Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI developments will force the company to adapt its structure in the coming years. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

NEW YORK – Microsoft is planning to axe thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, as part of the company’s latest move to trim its workforce amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence. The cuts are expected to be announced early in July, following the end of Microsoft’s fiscal year, according to people familiar with the matter. The reductions will not exclusively affect sales teams, and the timing could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. The company declined to comment. The terminations would follow a previous round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people and fell hardest on product and engineering positions, largely sparing customer-facing roles like sales and marketing. In April, Microsoft told employees it planned to use third-party firms to handle more sales of software to small and mid-size customers. The tech giant has ramped up its investments in AI, aiming to solidify its leadership as companies across industries accelerate the integration of AI into their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said on June 17 that the roll-out of generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years. Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion (S$102.8 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The company had 228,000 workers at the end of June 2024, 45,000 of them in sales and marketing. Microsoft often restructures teams and announces other changes near the end of its fiscal year, which closes in June.

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is witnessing increased network activity, which is bullish for its native token’s price. On-chain data also shows that whales are actively accumulating XRP, with the addresses holding one million coins recently reaching a new high. In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that the XRP Ledger is showing signs of growth, from both a usage and key stakeholder perspective. The platform revealed that there are now over 2,700 whale and shark wallets holding at least 1 million XRP for the first time in the token’s 12-year history. Additionally, Santiment stated that the number of active XRP addresses has averaged over 295,000 daily over the past week. This is notable as the normal daily average over the past three months was between 35,000 and 40,000. It is worth mentioning that the XRPL recorded some major developments last week. One is the launch of Circle’s USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. This is expected to boost network activity given the increasing demand for stablecoins. Crypto analyst Moon Lambo predicted that this would increase the total value locked (TVL) on the network. He also noted how this was bullish for the XRP price, since users will need the token for every USDC transaction. Furthermore, Ondo Finance launched its tokenized US treasury fund (OUSG) on the XRP Ledger last week, which could have also contributed to the surge in network activity. The BlackRock-backed fund will be mintable and redeemable using the RLUSD stablecoin. Meanwhile, Guggenheim also recently partnered with Ripple to launch the first Digital Commercial Paper on the XRPL. Amid the surge in network activity on the XRPL, crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the XRP price could rally above $4 and even reach as high as $8. He stated that the altcoin is holding a clear breakout and is getting ready for a major bullish continuation. Marks added that the targets are at $4.80 and $8, marking new all-time highs (ATHs) for XRP. Crypto analyst Dark Defender recently alluded to a previous analysis in which he stated that the XRP price could make a decision within two weeks. The analyst is confident that the altcoin could rally to as high as $6 on this Wave 5 impulsive move to the upside. He has also previously predicted that XRP would reach double digits in this market cycle. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the XRP price has again dropped below the $2.25 level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades had warned that the support levels at $2.01, $1.90, and $1.55 could be in play if the $2.25 level holds as resistance. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.16, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just got brutally honest about AI — and other bosses may follow his lead

Time Published: 2025-06-18T22:39:50Z

Amazon's CEO just said the quiet part out loud: AI is coming for plenty of jobs — and other bosses may soon follow his lead. On Tuesday, Andy Jassy said in a memo that employees should figure out "how to get more done with scrappier teams" and that the move toward AI would eventually "reduce our total corporate workforce." Amazon, with about 1.5 million workers, is the second-largest private employer in the US. Workplace commentators told Business Insider that Jassy's candor may prompt other leaders to feel comfortable telling their employees who — or what — will replace them. Marlo Lyons, an author and certified executive coach, said Amazon's directness might encourage other companies to follow suit. "I think if you have a big company that's talking about AI, then it does make it easier for smaller companies to talk about AI — this is basically culture modeling," she told BI. "In some ways, it might scare you, but at the same time, it should make you say, 'OK, at least my company's being honest to me about it,'" Lyons said. Other CEOs have also become increasingly transparent about AI expectations, although few have explicitly said it would reduce their existing workforce. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said in a memo in April that "AI usage is now a baseline expectation," and that before managers make a hire, they must first prove that AI couldn't do the job better. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in December last year that the fintech had stopped hiring because "AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do." Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that AI agents were already beginning to act like junior-level coworkers and may soon be able to deliver business solutions. "It'll send shivers down the backs of employees," said Cary Cooper, professor of organizational psychology and health at Manchester Business School in the UK, of the Jassy memo. "I think it'll open it up for HR to now have discussions with senior management about how we deal with this — the introduction of AI in our business." Cooper warned companies should be specific with staff about which jobs might be affected and what retraining opportunities are available, or risk "regrettable turnover" — losing the talent they most want to keep. Thomas Roulet, professor of organisational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told BI that linking layoffs with AI was not new — even if Jassy's openness felt like a turning point. "Firms do not hesitate to use AI as a reason to downsize, whether it is an excuse or an opportunity," he said. "Very often, they downsize before even thinking what they will replace with AI, due to market pressures." "AI is a great scapegoat for a lot of unpopular strategic choices at the moment," Roulet added. "There is enormous pressure on companies to show that they are able to replace employees with AI tools," Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at The Wharton School, told BI. "But the evidence indicates that it is very difficult to do so." Klarna, for example, made headlines in 2022 when the company laid off 700 employees, mostly customer service agents, in favor of AI. In May, the financial services company had to hire some back to improve its services. In Roulet's view, many companies that have already cut jobs in favor of AI were moving too fast. "Unfortunately, many firms think of workforce reduction and engage with such reductions before they even think about AI replacement," said Roulet. "The reality is that bringing in AI into work takes a lot of learning cycles and trial and error — it does not appear clearly overnight." Jump to

Title: [EU] Ghosts of K’aresh Development Notes

Time Published: 2025-06-18T21:51:24Z
Full Content:
The Ghosts of K’aresh Public Test Realm (PTR) is now available for testing. These changes are for the first week of PTR testing and do not contain the full patch notes for the update. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K’aresh is a fragmented void-touched world just waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. You’ll fight alongside Alleria Windrunner and her mentor Locus-Walker among others to end the clear and present danger he poses. Players will also have the opportunity to explore Tazavesh, The Veiled Market, work toward restoring the ecosphere in eco-domes, go Phase Diving, and more. Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. You’ll forge through the campaign, gather allies, hunt down the mounting threats found in K’aresh, and set the stage to take on Dimensius himself all from this iconic ethereal and broker hub of activity. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps can be used to transform into an energy form much like the ethereals to interact with the world in a new way. You’ll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! Reshii Wraps will upgrade and scale with you and include new visuals as you progress through content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. A massive facility built upon the planet to harvest cosmic energy, players will fight their way in and through this raid dungeon to take on the Shadow Guard Ethereals who have set their efforts toward reviving Dimensius. You’ll join with your allies to ultimately fight Dimensius in a cosmic battle of truly epic proportions to stave off what could be the end of Azeroth as we know it. Raid Bosses Manaforge Omega will be available for testing in a later PTR build. The raid testing schedule can be found here. Season 3 of The War Within brings with it a new dungeon—Eco-Dome Al’dani. This is a three-boss dungeon where you’ll encounter a variety of creatures including devourers who are consuming the life found there. You’ll also face the Wastelanders who have dug in and learn their purpose within the eco-dome. This new dungeon will be available immediately in Normal, Heroic, and Mythic0 (baseline) difficulties. Dungeon Bosses Tazavesh will also return as a full Mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 in the weekly Great Vault. Season 3 dungeons will be available for testing in a later PTR build. The dungeon testing schedule can be found here. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve. Using the Reshii Wraps will unlock unique challenge gateways to bosses or challenge rooms. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died–this feature will be available in a later PTR build. There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season’s Nemesis. Along the Delver’s Journey progression, unlock customizations for your Delver’s Mana Skimmer–the newest Delve mount attainable during Season 3–and two new toys, the Delver’s Mana-Bound Ethergate–opens a portal to return to the Explorers’ League home base in Dornogal, and Etheric Brannmorpher–summons an Ethereal Transmorpher that can change your appearance. The ethereals of K’aresh first witnessed this destructive maw of the void after Dimensius’s attack. They believe Reshanor has manifested as their eternal punishment - for it comes back around to keep eating them and their planet as he grows infinitely bigger over the years. With a new season, also comes a new set of class gear. These new sets will feature set bonuses that will align with your chosen Hero Talents instead of your class or specialization. Head to the FEEDBACK: The War Within Season 3 Class Sets forum thread to read all the new set bonuses and leave feedback after trying them out on the PTR. Setzertauren in Stormwind and Orgrimmar will provide class sets for testing. Several PvP talents will be updated with the content update; players will also be able to undertake a new World Quest to vanquish their foes on Vanquisher’s Wake island. This new point of interest is a perfect spot to hang out for those seeking to go toe-to-toe in some outdoor PvP battles. No quest required for entry. Simply turn on War Mode and enter with caution.

Title: Mutual Fund Giant Wellington Looks to Break Into Business of Buying, Selling PE Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co., which is best-known for traditional stockpicking funds, is plotting a move into the fast-growing business of buying and selling private equity stakes. The money manager is in talks with potential hires to start a so-called secondaries arm to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is working with an executive recruiter and told candidates about its plans, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. A Wellington spokeswoman declined to comment. The firm, which oversees more than $1 trillion of assets, has its roots in managing mutual funds. Like other money managers, it’s increasingly drawn to the $13 trillion private markets industry as the pool of publicly traded US firms shrinks. Traditional asset managers are also grappling with outflows and squeezed margins as clients leave mutual funds for cheaper index products. That shift — and the allure of higher fees — is reshaping managers that are best known for picking stocks and bonds. Wellington, which has a large institutional client base, has been investing in private equity for at least a decade and has also backed unicorns such as WeWork and Airbnb. In recent years, it has made a more aggressive push into private markets. The Boston-based firm hired a team of four fund managers from Pacific Investment Management Co. this year to start a private real estate credit platform as it aims to grow in private credit. By entering the secondaries market, Wellington would provide relief to investors that need cash because of a prolonged lull in deal exits. President Donald Trump’s tariff war has further hobbled dealmaking, forcing yield-starved pensions to offload their stakes to secondhand buyers at discounts for cash. Meanwhile, elite universities are selling private-fund stakes to shore up cash in the face of threats to their tax-exempt status. New buyers are now stepping into the arena, betting that the secondaries industry could top past records. Exchange-traded fund giant BlackRock Inc., which struck deals to buy three private-markets firms in the space of a year, said in a recent report that it predicts that the secondaries market growth will accelerate.

Title: Microsoft planning thousands of job cuts aimed at salespeople

Microsoft is planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, as the tech giant streamlines its workforce amid increased investments in artificial intelligence, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The latest layoffs follow Microsoft's previous round of job cuts in May, which affected about 6000 employees. The tech giant has ramped up its investments in AI, aiming to solidify its leadership as companies across industries accelerate the integration of AI into their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. Earlier this week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that the rollout of generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years. Microsoft has planned a capital expenditure of US$80 billion ($123 billion) this fiscal year, with most of it aimed at expanding data centres to ease capacity bottlenecks for AI services. The layoffs are expected to be announced early next month, following the end of the tech giant's fiscal year, the report said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The job cuts will not exclusively affect the sales teams, and the timing could still change, the report added. Microsoft had 228,000 workers as of June last year.

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, believes that one stock market segment will continue to surprise investors with its upside in the next five years. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says that stocks in the US tech sector will continue to print gains and trade above their fair value in the coming years. According to Ives, the tech sector will witness massive developments in the years ahead, fueled by the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). “My view of tech, if you focus just on valuation, you missed every transformational tech stock in the last 20 years. I believe the market is still massively underestimating what growth is going to look like for the AI revolution in tech… You could say some of these are expensive. You’ve got the next two, three, four, five years, given our view of autonomous robotics, that’s why I think we’re going to be talking about the Nasdaq 20,000, 25,000, over the coming years. And that’s why any type of geopolitical sort of events, we always view as opportunities to own these names cheaper. That’s always been our view in the last 25 years covering tech.” As of Tuesday’s close, the Nasdaq is trading at 21,719 points.

Title: BlackRock’s $2,900,000,000 Tokenized Money Market Fund To Be Used by Crypto.com and Deribit: Report

BlackRock’s multibillion-dollar tokenized money market fund (BUIDL) is reportedly going to be used by the crypto exchange platforms Derebit and Crypto.com. According to a new report from Forbes, both crypto exchanges will accept BUIDL as collateral, meaning that traders can now use the yield-bearing stablecoin as a security deposit to hedge leveraged bets, freeing up more of their capital to be used elsewhere. As stated by Michael Sonnenshein, chief operating officer at Securitize, a partner of BlackRock, “This is a major turning point. We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL – which launched in March 2024 – quickly expanded across multiple blockchains, including layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL), and has $2.9 billion in assets. According to the report, Crypto.com will make BUIDL available for institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, while Derebit, the largest crypto options exchange by volume, which normally takes collateral in the form of Bitcoin (BTC), will make BUIDL available on its spot exchange. The report also notes that BUIDL may soon become available over the top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase, as the firm is currently in the process of acquiring Derebit.

Title: CEOs haven't felt this gloomy about the economy since the pandemic
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/business-roundtable-ceo-economic-outlook-index-5-year-low-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-18T19:00:44Z

CEOs aren't feeling too hot about the economy. The Business Roundtable's CEO Economic Outlook Index dropped by 15 points in the second quarter to 69, marking its lowest level since 2020 and well below its historic average of 83. A total of 169 CEOs participated in the survey, which was conducted between June 2 and June 13. "The quarter's survey results signal that Business Roundtable CEOs are approaching the next six months with caution," Cisco CEO and Business Roundtable chair Chuck Robbins said in a release accompanying the results. The survey assesses three categories: capital spending plans, hiring intentions, and sales expectations. Hiring plans saw the steepest decline this quarter, dropping 19 points. Capital investment plans followed with a 15-point decrease, and sales expectations fell by 11 points. The survey indicates that 41% of CEOs surveyed expect their company to decrease employment in the next six months, compared to 29% last quarter. The percentage of CEOs surveyed who expected hiring to increase in the next six months also dropped quarter over quarter, from 33% to 26%. It's the latest indication of a challenging job market, as many companies have made moves to flatten their org charts and slow hiring. A number of major companies have conducted layoffs this year, including Meta, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Intel. Other companies, like Salesforce, have announced a pause on hiring engineers. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten said the quarterly decline was driven by "broad-based uncertainty," stemming from an "unpredictable trade policy environment." The CEO said expanding tax reform is important but will not solve the issue on its own. "American businesses also need the Administration rapidly to secure deals with our trading partners that open markets, remove harmful tariffs and provide certainty for investment," Bolten said. President Donald Trump's tariff threats have taken consumers and businesses on a roller coaster ride over the last few months. While some tariffs were enacted in April, the bulk of new tariffs have been paused until July to allow time for negotiations. The ups and downs have resulted in sharp stock market swings, led some companies to make tweaks to their supply chains, and impacted retail and food service sales as well as the outlook on home sales. Uncertainty around tariffs has made long-term planning difficult for many companies. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, released this month, indicated that half of the districts saw "slight to moderate" declines in economic activity, while three reported no growth at all. The Trump administration has said that tariff policies are in the best interest of the US, even if they create some short-term pain. While the report paints a largely gloomy picture of CEO sentiment, it's not at levels previously seen during the last recession. The Business Roundtable states that "readings at 50 or above indicate economic expansion," while readings below indicate a recession. In the second quarter of 2020, the economic outlook plummeted to an overall Index of 34.3, and quickly rebounded to 64 in the next quarter. However, the survey adds to a growing chorus of CEOs who are voicing concern for the near future as they navigate a choppy economic environment. Jump to

Tech giants are increasingly focusing on advancing AI and looking for ways the technology can be used to boost efficiency and performance. Due to the rapid expansion and adaptation of the technology, companies are relying more on AI for enhancement and, as a result, putting more heed to automating processes to streamline operations. Many companies, on account of the changing dynamics and agility of the market, have laid off their staff to create more resources and space for artificial intelligence. Now, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, warns its employees about jobs being cut in the coming years due to the growing focus on AI. The tech industry seems to be undergoing a significant shift with companies extensively embracing AI and automation to boost efficiency and streamline their operations. Due to this broader trend in the market, we see many of the roles either turning redundant or being replaced by AI, resulting in many tech giants undergoing some major organizational restructuring. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also seems to be part of the changing trends. In a memo sent to employees, he informed them that the company's corporate headcount is expected to be cut down over the next few years as part of the shifting industry and growing focus on AI advancement across the company. The CEO shared: As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. This is not the first time the company has intended to lay off its staff members. Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees. Recently, the divisions impacted by the job cuts were the devices and service group and the books division. Jassy, while emphasizing that the change is due to a wider adoption of AI and using the technology for further advancement, also took the chance to emphasize the current work the company is doing in this regard. Andy Jassy shared about Amazon's progress in terms of AI, as it has so far developed more than 1,000 AI applications and services. He also took a chance to brag that this is yet only a small fraction of what the company has in store, emphasizing the company's deeper investment in the technology. AI is not only serving to be a tool for advancement and operational efficiency, but also a key driver in the organizational restructuring of many companies today, and we could see even more companies opting in this direction.

Title: Why Hollywood studios are still downsizing
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/18/hollywood-studios-downsizing/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T17:29:32Z

By Samantha Masunaga, Los Angeles Times Hollywood’s workforce just needed to “survive ’til ’25.” That was last year’s hopeful mantra for entertainment industry pros battered by layoffs and limited film and TV production. But now as the year approaches its halfway point, a bleaker saying seems apt: “Exist ’til ’26.” Rosy projections of a robust recovery this year have not materialized. If anything, the downturn, at least in terms of employment at the studios, has continued. In recent weeks, three media and entertainment giants — Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global — have said they will lay off staffers. Disney cut several hundred employees in the U.S. and abroad, while Paramount shed hundreds of its domestic workforce and Warner Bros. eliminated several dozen positions. It is yet another sign that the industry is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic and the dual writers’ and actors’ strikes of 2023, while also trying to navigate the changing media landscape. As people continue to cut the cord and viewership of traditional broadcast television declines — taking with it valuable ad dollars — companies are reallocating resources to their streaming platforms. They’re cutting back on spending after massive investments during the so-called streaming wars. And now, economic uncertainty from President Trump’s tariffs has rattled the markets, creating a difficult overall business environment. “We’re going through this squeezing of our ecosystem in Hollywood,” said J. Christopher Hamilton, a practicing entertainment attorney and a professor at Syracuse University who focuses on the business of media. Companies are “trying to find a new normal, adjust to the financial pressures that the global economy is under and also figure out what is the smartest business model and path forward.” It’s a far cry from the hints of optimism some in the industry had toward the end of last year. With the strikes finally in the rearview mirror, and delayed films debuting in theaters and production slowly coming back, the thought was “we’re out of the strikes, we’ll be able to go back to the market, sell and buy,” Hamilton said. Instead, many of the recent conversations he’s had with clients and media executives have been centered on fear and uncertainty. People will tell him that it’s hard to sell a TV show, or that they don’t know if their job will be around in two weeks. The international market has also become more favorable to local content, meaning U.S.-made shows are now heavily competing with homegrown series. “It’s a horrible time in the business from the content creation, content production standpoint,” Hamilton said. “People don’t want to take risks. They’re fearful of losing their jobs.” The idea of “survive ’til ’25” was always a myth, said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. The issues the industry is facing are long term and disruptive. “The industry is retrenching,” he said. “And there’s going to be a shake-up that lasts for quite a while.” The continued decline of linear TV is one issue nearly all studios are grappling with. Though viewership is down and can drag on a company’s stock price, traditional broadcast TV still makes money, making it important to manage costs and generate profit for as long as possible. That also means job cuts in those areas. Disney’s layoffs hit its film and television marketing teams, television publicity, casting and development as well as corporate financial operations. Warner Bros. cut employees from its cable TV channels. While Paramount did not disclose the departments affected by the layoffs, its co-chief executives acknowledged in a note to staff that the decision came as the company navigates “continued industry-wide linear declines.” Linear TV’s struggles have led media companies to spin off their traditional television assets, including cable networks, into separate entities. Santa Monica-based Lionsgate got the ball rolling in 2023 when it said it would sever its film and TV studio business from its pay cable unit Starz, a transaction that was completed this year. Late last year, Comcast Corp. said it would make a new company consisting of its cable channels, including CNBC, MSNBC and USA Network. Then on Monday, Warner Bros. said it too would split into two publicly traded companies — one entity called Streaming & Studios and a second called Global Networks, that would consist of its cable channels such as CNN, TNT and Discovery. The Warner Bros. split is “an acknowledgment that the idea of building something big enough to compete in the streaming war didn’t work,” said Peter Murrieta, a writer and deputy director of the Sidney Poitier New American Film School at Arizona State University. Moreover, Netflix’s dominance in the streaming space has made many companies reevaluate their plans. “There were already signs pointing to the unsustainability of the number of shows and the number of streamers,” he said. “It’s the aftereffects of trying to compete at the streaming level and thinking that’s the future. Resources were put there, and now they have to retrench.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger has said as much in comments to Wall Street, acknowledging that the House of Mouse pumped out too many shows and movies to compete against Netflix. The company has since pulled back amid Iger’s call to focus on quality over quantity and to reach profitability in its streaming services, which it achieved last year. The company’s latest job postings now include a number of openings for software engineers. The larger economic environment, too, is of concern to those in Hollywood. In addition to industry-specific concerns about artificial intelligence and the decline of traditional TV and cable, the entertainment business is also grappling with domestic and global financial uncertainty. Paramount’s executives cited the “dynamic macro-economic environment” in its note to employees. “Right now, there is an absolute sense of terror among people in the business that they’ll be out of a job, that the old models aren’t working, that they won’t earn what they once did,” said Galloway of Chapman. “They’re not wrong to be afraid. I think they’re wrong to be as afraid as they are because it’s a retrenchment, and it’s a retrenchment following a gigantic expansion.” White-collar jobs in other industries are also being threatened by technological change, greater investment in AI and retrenchments after pandemic-era hiring sprees. Earlier this year, tech companies such as payment firm Square, Meta, Google and Workday said they would lay off employees. But Hollywood has always been a boom-and-bust industry, Galloway said, noting that in times of change, new opportunities always arise. Jobs in virtual production or AI are becoming more numerous. As studios cut back on their staff, they will still need producers to shepherd shows and films, said Susan Sprung, chief executive of the Producers Guild of America trade group. “These companies aren’t getting out of the business of producing great programming, movies and television,” she said. “If you don’t have as large of an executive team that can help supplement that, it makes it even more important that you have good producers working on every one of your projects.” While the current environment is tough, the industry has always been difficult, and people in this business are resourceful and intentional about their work, said Murrieta of Arizona State. Though it is a trying time, he said, “there’s got to be hope.” ©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — China’s largest shipping company is among the firms in talks to invest in a multinational consortium seeking to buy billionaire Li Ka-shing’s global ports, according to people familiar with the matter, in an effort to ease Beijing’s concerns over the controversial deal. China Cosco Shipping Corp. is one of several Chinese state-backed companies in discussions with the consortium led by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. on matters including how they might participate in the port deal, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The buying group also includes US firm BlackRock Inc. and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit. The inclusion of Chinese investors in the consortium emerged as one of the options to advance the ports sale after high-stakes talks in Switzerland last month between Chinese and US officials, some of the people said. Beijing has fiercely opposed the sale — including two ports along the Panama Canal — over concerns it could affect its global shipping and trade ambitions. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the deal as returning the strategic waterway to American influence. Once completed, the agreement to sell the two Panama ports and 41 others around the world is expected to net tycoon Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. more than $19 billion in cash. Talks are ongoing and the details are not yet finalized, the people said. Cosco, CK Hutchison and the Aponte family’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., which controls Terminal Investment, didn’t respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco shares in Hong Kong extended gains to as much as 6% Friday morning, while CK Hutchison erased losses and rose 1.9%. The talks are the latest twist in one of billionaire Li’s most geopolitically challenging deals amid escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies over global trade. The development has raised hopes that it could ease China’s concerns over the proposed transaction, which has been blasted by pro-Beijing newspapers as a betrayal of the nation and kowtowing to US pressure. The country’s market watchdog has vowed to review the sale, and Bloomberg News reported in March that authorities told state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to Li and his family. Despite the progress of the talks, a deal could still falter. A 145-day period for exclusive talks between CK Hutchison and the consortium ends in late July and the parties have already missed an initial goal of signing an agreement on the Panama part of the deal by early April. The current structure of the buyer consortium will give Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock, Bloomberg reported in April. Terminal Investment parent MSC has 28 offices across Greater China. It runs a terminal in China’s eastern city Ningbo and operates dozens of shipping services between the country and the rest of the world. In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this week, the head of the Panama Canal Authority said the consortium’s structure means a concentrated terminal ownership which could threaten the waterway’s competitiveness and neutrality. In response, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it supports Panama in defending its independence and reiterated its opposition to economic bullying. It’s unlikely that MSC will be allowed to take over all of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports due to concerns over market concentration from relevant competition authorities, said Eirik Hooper, a senior associate at maritime research consultancy Drewry. Still, any potential changes won’t affect the dominance for MSC, which will become the world’s largest terminal operator by throughput once the deal is completed, Hooper added. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Circle’s USDC and BlackRock’s BUIDL spearhead collateral innovation in derivatives markets

Innovative collateral use in derivatives markets gains regulatory nod, enhancing risk management and capital yield. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto trading platforms increasingly adopt blockchain-native assets like the USDC stablecoin and tokenized treasuries such as BlackRock’s BUIDL to enhance collateral efficiency in derivatives markets. These instruments offer a blend of stability, yield, and compliance, making them attractive to institutional players seeking capital optimization. On June 18, Coinbase Derivatives revealed that USDC will be accepted as collateral for margined futures, subject to regulatory approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said: “This is the first time we’ll see USDC used as collateral in US futures markets – and we will work closely with the CFTC to make this happen.” The stablecoin’s integration will rely on Coinbase Custody Trust, a Qualified Custodian regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. In a separate development, tokenized treasuries are also gaining traction in the derivatives market. On the same day, Securitize, a digital asset firm, announced that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) can now be used as collateral on Crypto.com and Deribit. The token represents a short-term yield-bearing fund backed by cash and US Treasuries and currently manages $2.9 billion in assets. By accepting BUIDL as margin, these platforms allow institutional traders to earn yield on their capital while deploying it for leveraged positions. These recent developments underline this trend and mark a significant shift toward more capital-efficient and transparent market structures. Coinbase pointed out that assets like USDC offer near-instant settlement and enjoy broad acceptance across centralized and decentralized platforms. Carlos Domingo, Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize, also echoed this view by saying: “Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry’s most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield.” Meanwhile, these moves follow the November 2024 recommendation from CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham, urging firms to explore the use of distributed ledger technology for non-cash collateral. According to her, embracing these new technologies would not compromise market integrity considering there have been “successful and proven commercial use cases for tokenization of assets, such as digital government bond issuances in Europe and Asia, over $1.5 trillion notional volume in institutional repo and payments transactions on enterprise blockchain platforms, and more efficient collateral and treasury management.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

The company also launched its off-road autonomy stack, acquired defence technology firm EpiSci, and introduced new defence products, Axion and Acuity.

BlackRock managing director Samir Menon said: “Our platform has been actively investing in the autonomous driving sector for years, and Applied Intuition has emerged as a key innovation leader. We are proud to back Applied Intuition as they continue their mission to make all vehicles intelligent.” Applied Intuition co-founder and CTO Peter Ludwig said: “The focus of this next phase is to accelerate the rollout of intelligent, software-defined systems across all domains — defence, automotive, trucking, construction, mining, and agriculture. With the continued backing of our investors, we’re just getting started.”

Behemoth’s release to June” before “delay[ing] . . . to fall or later.” On this news, Meta’s stock price fell $19.02 per share, or 2.88%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $640.34 per share on May 16, 2025.

U.S. equities were higher at midday as President Donald Trump again called on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates ahead of today's Fed decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Jabil (JBL) shares kept adding to their all-time highs when UBS increased its price target by a third, noting that soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products is boosting sales for the electronic equipment firm. A higher price target from Guggenheim sent shares of Oracle (ORCL) up. The analysts argued the software maker's revenue will soar in the next two fiscal years. Shares of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) advanced after the Senate passed legislation on stablecoins, and that also lifted shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which just announced its own stablecoin-like digital currency yesterday. Zoetis (ZTS) shares fell on a downgrade from Stifel, which said competition will limit revenue for the manufacturer of drugs and vaccines for animals. Shares of Allstate (ALL) declined when the insurer estimated it had $777 million in catastrophic losses last month. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares dipped after the steelmaker gave weaker-than-anticipated current-quarter profit guidance, although the company did provide a positive outlook for its steel and aluminum operations. Oil futures slid. Gold prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Major cryptocurrencies were mixed, with bitcoin edging higher. TradingView

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Warns Employees that AI Will Reduce Company's Workforce

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in a memo to employees this week that the company expects AI to reduce its workforce in the coming years, affecting both white-collar and warehouse workers. The Washington Post reports that Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, is bracing for a significant shift in its workforce as AI technology advances. In a memo sent to employees on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy warned that the company expects AI to reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years, as the technology brings efficiency gains across various departments. Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. The warning comes amidst growing excitement and concern about the potential of AI to disrupt the job market. Some industry leaders, such as Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, have predicted that unemployment could spike to 20 percent in the next few years due to the rapid development of AI technology. As Breitbart News previously reported, Amodei has dire predictions about the future employment of office workers: The Anthropic CEO said AI companies and the government need to stop “sugar-coating” what will happen next, which he warns could be a mass erasure of jobs in a variety of fields, and the axing of half of all entry-level white collar jobs, which Amodei says will lead to a 10-20 percent spike in unemployment in the next one to five years. “We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,” Amodei said. “I don’t think this is on people’s radar.” “It’s a very strange set of dynamics, where we’re saying: ‘You should be worried about where the technology we’re building is going,’” the Anthropic CEO added, acknowledging that he is building the very technology he suspects will soon and swiftly transform society. While economists have generally found that previous waves of AI and automation technology had little overall effect on employment, the latest advances in AI have prompted suggestions that this pattern may be changing. A recent drop in the number of computer programmers has fueled speculation that AI is already beginning to impact the job market. Amazon, along with other large tech companies, made significant layoffs in 2023 after hiring sprees during the coronavirus pandemic. Since becoming CEO in 2021, Jassy has focused on doing more with less, creating a money-saving metric called “cost to serve” to drive down the company’s expenses in delivering goods and services to customers. In his memo, Jassy encouraged employees to embrace AI and to educate themselves about the technology to remain competitive in the changing landscape. He wrote, “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” The memo also highlighted Amazon’s own AI products, including chatbots for shopping, tools for generative AI ads, and Alexa+, an AI-enhanced version of the company’s virtual assistant Alexa.

Title: Sex Sells: How OnlyFans Turned Fetish-Friendly Celebs and Porn Stars Into a Multibillion-Dollar Juggernaut That Rivals Legacy Studios
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/onlyfans-sale-could-exceed-price-hollywood-studios-1236434430/

By Tatiana Siegel For the same amount of money it takes to buy one of Hollywood’s five remaining major studios, some investor may walk away with the nine-year-old porn-friendly platform OnlyFans. While Skydance’s bid to buy Paramount in a deal valued at $8 billion continues to spark daily headlines, little-known Hollywood player The Forest Road’s efforts to buy OnlyFans for $8 billion is playing out with far less fanfare. That’s a stunning juxtaposition considering the Paramount portfolio consists of CBS, Showtime and the “Godfather” trilogy, while popular content on OnlyFans includes pictures of Carmen Electra’s feet and nudes of “Wizards of Waverly Place” alum Dan Benson. It also signals an economic shift in the entertainment industry. Related Stories ‘The White Lotus’ Creator Mike White and Team Break Down the Finale’s Deadly Piña Colada Scenes — and Why Season 3 Made Him Feel Like a ‘Head Case’ ‘Mountainhead’ Stars Ramy Youssef and Cory Michael Smith Unpack Their Twisted Tech Bromance and Comparisons to Musk, Zuckerberg and ‘Succession’ “The name of the game is streaming and online content, and the OnlyFans $8 billion valuation could exceed the price tag of some legacy Hollywood studios, speaking to a new world for the industry where headwinds abound,” says Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. Popular on Variety But do the numbers add up? Many in Hollywood’s private equity space are skeptical that Forest Road, which is led by Zachary Tarica and reportedly manages $127 million in assets, could raise $8 billion. The Century City-based film financier has occupied a niche space in Hollywood since 2017, backing such films as Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Kindergarten Teacher” for Netflix and Guy Nattiv’s “Skin” for A24. Few outside the AFM set are familiar with the company and its slate of films, which also includes “The Manson Brothers Midnight Zombie Massacre” and “Chronicle of a Serial Killer.” In 2019, Forest Road invested in Yale Productions, which churned out low-budget movies like the 2023 Uma Thurman-Samuel L. Jackson pairing “The Kill Room.” Last month, Yale filed for bankruptcy, listing more than $55 million in liabilities against $18 million in assets. And in 2023, former Disney COO Thomas Staggs and onetime TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer stepped down from the Forest Road board. According to the SEC filing, Forest Road “has expanded its specialty finance platform across blockchain, digital assets, technology, entertainment, real estate, renewable energy tax credit lending, film tax credit administration, and tax credit brokerage.” But a source who has dealings with Forest Road says the company is legit. “They are very much in touch with BlackRock, Ares and these monster funds,” the source says. “They would not have any problem raising huge money on a deal like this.” (In October, Forest Road and Ares Management founders David Kaplan and Bennett Rosenthal bought a Formula E team.) Forest Road did not respond to a request for comment on this story. On the seller side, even less is known about Leonid Radvinsky, the 43-year-old majority owner of OnlyFans. The Soviet-born billionaire, who bought a 75% stake in OnlyFans’ parent company Fenix International in 2018, has reportedly donated millions to causes involving Ukraine and Israel. (Radvinsky has denied that he pledged $11 million to Israel lobbying group AIPAC.) The father of four, who is partly based in Florida, does not do press. OnlyFans declined comment for this story. While a potential Forest Road-OnlyFans transaction is shrouded in mystery, plenty is known about the parade of random celebrities who have migrated to the platform and how they are monetizing their brands. OnlyFans allows content creators to upload videos to their subscribers and takes 20% of their fees. Initially, the content was mostly explicit, earning OnlyFans a reputation as a purveyor of pornography. Bella Thorne was an early adoptee, making $1 million on her first day on the platform, but faced backlash from the sex worker community, which labeled her a “tourist.” More recently, a wide range of notable names have joined. “Harry Potter” alum Jessie Cave, catering to a fetish community, posts videos of and sounds made by her hair. In response to criticism for taking the OnlyFans plunge, Lily Allen wrote in an X post: “Imagine being an artist and having nearly 8 million monthly listeners on Spotify but earning more money from having 1,000 people subscribe to pictures of your feet. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.” Others, like rappers Cardi B and Trey Songz, offer behind-the-scenes content (including adult-oriented material in Songz’s case). At one point, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea was among the top earners, but she has mostly left the platform in favor of Telegram. The two biggest areas of growth for OnlyFans come via the comedy world and sports stars. While Whitney Cummings is the most high-profile comedian on the platform, having debuted a special there, newbies are benefiting most. In 2023, OnlyFans launched the grassroots comedy show “LMAOF,” which highlighted up-and-coming comedians whose humor might be too risqué for mainstream audiences. Some earnings have been wildly exaggerated. Blac Chyna reportedly pulled down $240 million from OnlyFans, but later said the true number was closer to $2 million. Still, there is real money to be made. On June 11, model Sophie Rain, who is believed to be among the highest paid on the platform, posted a screenshot of her earnings from subscriptions alone since she joined in 2023. The figure was more than $76 million. (An OnlyFans source did not dispute that figure.) “The Sopranos” star Drea de Matteo says she staved off foreclosure on her Laurel Canyon home by starting a page and posting racy content. “I got myself out of a lien on my house. I was in foreclosure,” she tells Variety. “But then the men are fickle and they drop off, and, you know, I’m not like super freaking naked all the time. People know that. Like it’s more of a me-and-my-panties vibes. So if you really want to make the big bucks, you gotta go full-on.” Adds de Matteo: “I was a moderate success. But to be totally honest, I wasn’t Bella Thorne. It saved my life, and now I have to think about doing other things because it won’t sustain.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: DeepSeek Inside: Origins, Technology, and Impact

Time Published: 2025-06-18T15:15:39Z
Full Content:
The release of DeepSeek V3 and R1 in January 2025 caused steep declines in the stock prices of companies that provide generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure technology and datacenter services.28 These two large language models (LLMs) came from a little-known Chinese startup with approximately 200 employees versus at least 3,500 for industry-leader OpenAI.2,14 DeepSeek seemed to have developed this powerful technology much more cheaply than previously thought possible. If true, DeepSeek had the potential to disrupt the economics of the entire GenAI ecosystem and the dominance of U.S. companies ranging from OpenAI to Nvidia.5,6 DeepSeek-R1 defines itself as “an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, specifically based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture.”a Here, DeepSeek acknowledges that the transformer researchers (who published their landmark paper while at Google in 2017) and OpenAI developed its basic technology. Nonetheless, V3 and R1 display impressive skills in neural-network system design, engineering, and optimization, and DeepSeek’s publications provide rare insights into how the technology actually works. This column reviews, for the non-expert reader, what we know about DeepSeek’s origins, technology, and impact so far. The parent of DeepSeek is High-Flyer, a quant hedge fund founded in 2015 in the city of Hangzhou, China.b It relies on AI and machine learning (ML) for stock-trading decisions. The cofounder, Liang Wenfeng (born 1985), is a graduate of Zhejiang University. He studied machine vision and started the company with two classmates after researching the topic since 2008. High-Flyer is reported to have 113 employees and $59 million in revenues while managing $8 billion in assets.11,c During 2019–2022, High-Flyer spent approximately $139 million and stockpiled 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs to build a supercomputer. The A100 is lower in performance than the datacenter-standard Nvidia H100 (the U.S. government banned both for export to China in October 2023).9,24,29 In 2021, the Chinese government began a regulatory crackdown on high-frequency speculative stock trading. In response, Liang created a second team of researchers to focus on fundamental AI and ML research. He hired graduates from top Chinese universities and worked closely with Chinese academics. The team evaded government scrutiny because it was separate from the investment group and not focused on consumer AI.9,25 In 2023, High-Flyer spun off this second team as DeepSeek (see the accompanying table). One year later, the new company released products and reports that attracted worldwide attention. (In March 2025, the Chinese government also named DeepSeek a “national treasure” and placed travel restrictions on key employees.26) What made headlines was DeepSeek’s claim, based on a technical report published on its website dated December 27, 2024, that the company spent merely $5.6 million training V3. DeepSeek also claimed V3 approximated or exceeded the performance of other leading LLMs (Qwen 2.5–Alibaba, Llama 3.1–Meta, GPT-4o–OpenAI, Claude 3.5–Anthropic). The cost was so low because V3 required only 2.788 million hours of pre-training and post-training, done on a cluster of 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs (the lower-bandwidth version of H100, permissible for export to China), at an estimated cost of $2/hour. By contrast, to train GPT-4, it is reported that OpenAI used a cluster of 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs and spent at least $100 million.12,29 It had generally been accepted that companies need to spend $100 million to $1 billion to train their LLMs.11 The higher number covers variations, such as the nine different versions of Meta’s Lama 3.d It probably did not cost much to develop R1 once DeepSeek had V3.1 However, DeepSeek has not revealed the separate development costs for R1 or its predecessors and variants. We also do not know how much hardware High-Flyer and DeepSeek had access to in addition to the supercomputer. The research firm SemiAnalysis estimates DeepSeek had access to as many as 50,000 Hopper-class (probably H800) Nvidia GPUs and, for V3/R1, spent more than $500 million on GPU hardware and about $1.3 billion in total development costs.9 These estimates, which seem to be approximate guesses made in hindsight, would be comparable to development costs for the reasoning GPT models from OpenAI and the Llama 3 series from Meta. The December 2024 technical report also states that, “During pre-training, we train [sic] DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens.”8 One token equals approximately four characters or 0.75 English words. Fifteen billion tokens are approximately the amount of high-quality text available on the English-language Internet. It is also the estimate for pre-training tokens Meta used for Llama 3 and twice the estimate for OpenAI’s GPT-4 of 6.5 trillion tokens.10 In other words, training on DeepSeek-V3 reportedly took many fewer hours and much less money than comparable LLMs but covered a similar or much higher level of content. Sasha Rush concludes as well that V3’s performance is comparable to OpenAI GPT-4o but with substantially less training costs, while R1 resembles an open source version of OpenAI-o1, which had been the market leader for reasoning LLMs.22 Reasoning LLMs generate better answers if they run more computations in the inference (question-answering) stage. The reasoning approach works particularly well when there are correct answers the system can check against and provide rewards for, like in mathematical modeling, coding, or logical reasoning.22 DeepSeek built R1 as a reasoning version of V3 and released two smaller versions of R1 based on distillations of the open source Llama 3 (Meta) and Qwen 2.5 (Alibaba).7,21,e V3 consumed the bulk of the engineering work but R1 is important because it showed DeepSeek that “reasoning emerges as a behavior from pure reinforcement learning.”19 Here we see a difference in training strategy. OpenAI built its reasoning models by starting with human-supervised fine-tuning and then using reinforcement learning, followed again by extensive human fine-tuning. By contrast, DeepSeek skipped human pre-training and allowed the model to improve its reasoning capabilities by learning on its own (that is, reinforcement learning with rewards) and then a few hours of human post-training. As it built R1, DeepSeek also enhanced V3 through rounds of reinforcement learning, with rewards and verifications of answers. V3 and R1 used the same training data, and the V3-base model is inside R1. However, R1 benefitted from this “distillation” of learning from V3. Moreover, designing R1 to show the reasoning process made it easier to fine-tune.22 Part of the explanation for the low-cost, high-performance of V3/R1 is DeepSeek’s follower position and access to open source technology.20 But equally important seems to be DeepSeek’s technology and training strategy. Most experts cite the clever architecture and multistage training, with human fine-tuning only in a post-training phase. In particular, three complementary approaches and supporting techniques balanced engineering cost and system performance: Mixture of experts, reinforcement learning, and distillation. Mixture of experts (MoE) and supporting techniques. MoE architectures use several small specialized language models to spread out the data analysis and training load. Different prompts or “weights” call up specialized experts that, of the total parameters available, access only a small subset, such as 37 billion out of 671 billion parameters in R1. Accessing a subset of parameters, called Sparse Neural Network Training, avoids redundant or unnecessary calculations. By contrast, GPT-4 appears as a “dense” neural network with access to 1.8 trillion parameters for every operation.16 The MoE concept is not new but has been difficult to scale.22 The French startup Mistral AI did release in December 2023 the “open-weight” MoE LLM 8x7B, with eight experts (two operational at any given time), each accessing a total of 166 billion parameters and resembling a “scaled-down GPT-4.” Apparently, it was innovative and efficient but did not garner the same attention as the efficient and low-cost DeepSeek V3/R1.13 DeepSeek relied on specific techniques to minimize compute resources needed to share data across the smaller experts. It used parallelization to coordinate the computational tasks running on different clusters of networked computers (GPUs). It used quantization to improve computational efficiency by limiting the precision of calculations (decimal points) to the lowest level necessary for a specific computation.22 Examples would be converting 32-bit floating-point numbers to 16-bit, 8-bit, or even integer (whole-number) formats. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supporting techniques. The RL approach focuses on ML via trial and error with rewards for particular outcomes, in R1’s case, accuracy and format of the answers. OpenAI and other reasoning LLMs also use reinforcement learning and rewards.18 However, OpenAI has relied heavily on supervised training by human experts that requires enormous amounts of data and time for pre-labeling the data sets and feeding the system questions and correct answers.16 DeepSeek says it used human supervision only in post-training to fine-tune its models and spent very few hours.8 In general, the analogy would be to train a computer to play chess by giving it the rules on how to move pieces and then letting the machine learn mostly by playing matches rather than pretraining with insights from a human grandmaster.11 Other techniques complemented RL. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning divides a large, complex problem into intermediate steps that are easier to analyze and refine.17 DeepSeek used RL and CoT training to turn V3 from a relatively simple LLM into the more sophisticated reasoning R1 by asking it to show the steps used to analyze and answer questions.21 Another complementary technique is group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Many LLMs incorporate a slow and expensive training approach with a “policy model” (rules or guidelines) to decide on actions and then a separate “critic model” to evaluate those actions. GRPO skips the critic model step by taking groups of scores (data from several actions) and learning by comparing the scores.29 In the R1 white paper, DeepSeek reported: “we use DeepSeek-V3-Bases as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning … We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems.”7 DeepSeek also used multi-token prediction (MTP) during V3 pretraining to improve data efficiency, noting: “Instead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next two tokens through the MTP technique … which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks.”8 Distillation. This approach uses a large “teacher” model to transfer knowledge to train or fine-tune a smaller “student” model. The smaller model requires much less memory and compute time to operate, and can be faster during the inference stage. For example, the teacher model can transfer prediction outputs that serve as instructions for how to answer specific types of questions, saving the student model from the extensive training and computations normally required to arrive at those instructions.17 There have been suggestions that DeepSeek distilled outputs or acquired proprietary data from OpenAI models, but there is no evidence of this.22,23 DeepSeek used a distillation of R1 for post-training of V3 to add some reasoning capability and it used V3 to help train R1.8 DeepSeek also experimented with small versions of R1 trained on distillations of the open source Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3. These distilled versions performed better than a preliminary model (DeepSeek-R1-Zero), despite being much smaller, though they did not perform as well as R1.19 The DeepSeek team offered two conclusions regarding this combination of distillation and reinforcement learning as well as the limitations of their approach: “First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL … require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.”7 DeepSeek optimized V3 and R1 for different tasks. V3 does very well on standard benchmarking tests for logic problems and code writing. R1 is better at deeper reasoning and math.12,16 Both V3 and R1 are said to be comparable or better than LLMs from Anthropic (Claude) and xAI (Grok), though still behind Google (Gemini).11 Chatbot Arena at University of California Berkeley publishes a ranking where R1 came in third, matching the performance of ChatGPT-4o.3 The cost to access V3 and R1 application programming interfaces (APIs) is so low that DeepSeek has disrupted the economics of the LLM API market.4 In early 2025, DeepSeek priced V3 at $0.07 per million input tokens and $0.11 per million output tokens, and R1 at $0.55 for input and $2.19 per million output tokens. By contrast, OpenAI priced GPT-4o at $15 per million input and $60 per million output tokens (prices that were approximately half of what OpenAI had charged earlier).29 Price-performance has made DeepSeek very popular among open source developers and all major cloud service providers support access. In China, car manufacturers, local governments, hospitals, state-owned enterprises, and private companies have embedded DeepSeek into their applications. Tencent has incorporated DeepSeek into its search engine for WeChat and the Chinese version Weixin. Baidu uses DeepSeek in its search engine. Other major companies such as Huawei, NetEase, Bytedance/TikTok are also users.15 In the U.S., AMD has integrated DeepSeek-V3 into its Instinct MI300X GPUs to optimize AI inference and GPU performance.28 However, some countries (the U.S., Australia, South Korea, India, Italy, and Taiwan) have warned about Chinese ownership or prohibited usage on government devices.27 There has been concern that DeepSeek’s low prices could commoditize GenAI technology and lead to steep drops in company sales. But another potential outcome is Jevons Paradox—the observation that improvements in efficiency and lower prices do not necessarily lead to falling revenues.3 If demand is sensitive to price, then usage and sales could increase dramatically as more people access the less expensive product or service. So far, Jevons Paradox seems to be holding up: Demand for GenAI software and GPU hardware continues to rise. Reasoning LLMs are improving and likely to find many more applications. Debates continue around the significance of DeepSeek’s innovations. Dario Amodei, cofounder of Anthropic and former VP of Research at OpenAI, describes DeepSeek’s achievement as mainly an important advance in engineering efficiency. He sees V3/R1 as part of a shift already underway from a focus during 2020–2023 on expensive and time-consuming pretraining, running software on ever-more-powerful and expensive hardware, to more economical machine-based reinforcement learning, sometimes with less than state-of-the-art hardware.1 However we view DeepSeek, it seems noteworthy that a Chinese startup, operating under American export constraints, has demonstrated clever ways to balance cost and performance in LLM development. DeepSeek’s open source code and sharing of detailed information has already made GenAI technology more accessible and understandable.

Title: A Chinese herbal-medicine stock with no revenue has surged 60,000% this year. 5 things to know about the company's mysterious spike.

Full Content:
Shares of a little-known Chinese herbal medicine company have surged this year, with a fresh rally seeing the price quadruple in less than a week. It's been a head-scratching move, since the company is unprofitable, and shares have moved on seemingly no news. Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, saw its US-listed stock soar 398% over the first two days of the week. But that move pales in comparison to the year-to-date increase, which amounted to roughly 60,000% through Tuesday's close. The company, which offers a proprietary oral formula it says can help treat disorders like ADHD and autism, has not generated any revenue, according to a regulatory filing from October. Over the last two fiscal years, the company said it lost a combined $10.4 million. So, what on earth is going on with this stock? Here's what to know. Regencell, which trades under the ticker "RGC" on the Nasdaq, soared 283% on Monday after its 38-for-1 stock split went into effect. The company originally announced the stock split on June 2. While stock splits don't generate any value for the company — with overall market cap staying unchanged — they are often viewed as a bullish driver, since a lower per-share price can make a stock more appealing to retail investors. Regencell finished Monday with a market cap of $30 billion, which swelled further to $39 billion at Tuesday's close. That made it — at least temporarily — worth more than more well-known companies like Lululemon, Kraft Heinz, and Reddit. The rapid rise of Regencell stock was bound to catch the eye of the retail crowd, but even the enduringly bullish cohort is incredulous about what might be going on. Though Regencell is still less talked about than flagship stocks like Tesla and Apple, users on Reddit were quick to identify the surge this week, with some speculating that Regencell was the market's newest "meme stock." "Regencell is doing some weird stuff again," one user wrote on the subreddit r/shortsqueeze. "I'm trying to decide if I should pull out before a possible crash," another user, who said they were a longtime investor, said on the r/pennystocks subreddit. "I was gambling. Didn't have a clue what this company is," another user wrote on a separate thread on r/shortsqueeze about Regencell this month. "I've been watching it go the last two weeks and keep telling myself that it will crash as soon as I buy back in." Regencell stock was also surging around the time Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his anti-vaccine push, with the Health and Human Services Secretary removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week, an independent panel that helps shape vaccination policies in the US. Regencell says it has a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, a liquid-based oral formula it says can help treat ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder. The formula, which is meant to be taken twice a day and aims to treat the "fundamental cause" of neurocognitive disorders, contains "only natural ingredients," the firm says. Its website lists various herbs with qualities that can help with blood circulation, digestion, "detoxication," and other functions. "We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," the firm said in its October filing. The company only has a small number of shares available to trade, one factor that can explain the large swings in its stock. Out of its 500 million shares, just 30 million are available for public trading. That's a far lower percentage than the average for the more widely traded stocks that populate major indexes. Most of the company is owned by Regencell's CEO, Yat-Gai Au. He owned 86% of the company, or a $426 million stake in the first quarter, according to holdings data. His net worth has surged to as much as $33 billion this week, according to Bloomberg, vaulting him into the ranks of the world's richest people. Regencell's second-largest holder, Digital Mobile Venture, owned 7.6% of the company at the end of the first quarter, or around $37.5 million. RBC, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley also owned miniscule amounts of the stock. Initial public offerings from Chinese or Hong Kong-based firms have been in the spotlight recently. A report from The Wall Street Journal this week said that more than 20 China-based companies and 17 Hong Kong-based companies that went public on the Nasdaq since 2020 have lost 50% of their value or more in a single trading day over the last two years. In 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a warning about a "heightened threat of fraud" related to small-cap companies that had recently gone public on US exchanges. Many of the companies associated with fraud had operators based in China or broker-dealers based in Hong Kong, the regulator said. In many cases, the broker-dealers were allocated 90% or more of the public float, Finra said, meaning they held most of the IPO shares. The small remaining float leaves stocks vulnerable to market manipulation, it said, referring to such companies as "ramp-and-dump schemes." Jump to

BlackRock buys 6,088 BTC, triggering major short liquidations and fueling Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. BlackRock just bought 6,088 Bitcoin [BTC], worth nearly $638.5 million—one of the largest single BTC acquisitions this quarter. Naturally, this injected a fresh wave of institutional conviction into the market. Of course, the ripple effect wasn’t limited to sentiment alone. On-chain data suggests this move triggered a domino of trading activity, forcing speculators to rapidly recalibrate. Following the purchase, short Bitcoin liquidations surged. It was the second-biggest jump after the 9th of June, when liquidations reached a high on a price breakout. Back then, BTC’s breakout triggered mass exits from bearish positions. This time, the pattern repeated. As shorts unwound, the upward pressure kicked in fast. Bitcoin’s price responded with an immediate spike, showing bulls were quick to reclaim control. Moreover, if BlackRock’s allocation inspires follow-on institutional buying, a cascade of liquidations could fuel another leg up. Source: CryptoQuant Despite the price rally, Bitcoin’s Exchange Outflows have shrunk in the last week. Fewer withdrawals of BTC generally mean that traders and investors alike, with BlackRock leading, are purchasing and holding onto assets, looking to further increase their value. That said, should outflows start climbing again, it could confirm another round of accumulation and signal bullish continuation. For now, the market sits on edge, waiting for either a cooling or an ignition. Source: CryptoQuant BlackRock’s timing is crucial. It comes against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and growing concerns regarding fiat stability. Traditionally, gold was always the go-to hedge during such times. However, today, Bitcoin appears to be increasingly getting popular as a virtual hedge. BlackRock’s move mirrors the institutions’ attitudes towards Bitcoin are shifting. It is no longer seen as a mere speculative asset—it is being increasingly woven into broader macro strategies.

Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

The discrepancy between the predicted and actual input, known as the prediction error, is used to update the brain’s internal models. This process is thought to occur through canonical circuits, hierarchically organized neural networks where top–down predictions and bottom–up prediction errors create a feedback loop that allows the brain to refine its models. Recent work suggested that positive prediction errors, occurring when the actual input exceeds the predicted input, and negative prediction errors, occurring when the actual input is less than the predicted input, are calculated in separate populations of neurons within these canonical circuits [6–9]. While extensive research has investigated positive prediction errors using the oddball paradigm and its variations [10–18] these studies face significant limitations. Specifically, oddball responses consist of more than just positive prediction errors. First, they also contain sensory signals, which are often hard to disentangle. Additionally, a deviant stimulus also represents the omission of the standard stimulus, thereby generating a negative prediction error, which further complicates the interpretation. In contrast, responses to omitted expected stimuli do not contain sensory input and could directly represent negative error signals, potentially offering a crucial step in elucidating the computation of prediction errors. Omission responses have been observed in human studies [19–24] and more recently in single neurons within the visual and auditory cortices [7,9,25–28]. However, omission responses could arise from processes other than predictive coding and may not necessarily represent negative prediction errors. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the information encoded in these responses to confirm their functional role and investigate how they might arise from the interactions between prediction and sensory signals, an area that remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigated how neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond to the omission of expected auditory stimuli while manipulating their predictability. We use high-resolution extracellular recordings to simultaneously record activity from a large population of neurons across multiple cortical layers, while presenting tone sequences where the probability of tone presentations was systematically varied. We identified a subset of auditory neurons that exhibit two key characteristics of negative prediction-error encoding. First, the neurons displayed omission responses whose intensity was directly correlated with the statistical likelihood of specific omitted tones, demonstrating a quantitative representation of the prediction error. Second, these neurons exhibited omission responses that built up from trial to trial, reflecting predictions established by the accumulation of evidence through repeated exposure to the stimuli. These neurons, which we named “Probability Encoding Omission Neurons” (PEONs), were primarily found in the granular and supragranular layers of the auditory cortex and were distributed across different auditory fields including primary auditory cortex (A1), ventral auditory field (VAF), and anterior auditory field (AAF), with a significantly higher proportion observed in A1. Interestingly, while PEONs showed selective responses to omissions, they responded broadly to tones, highlighting an asymmetry between the processing of top–down predictions and bottom–up sensory signals. To explain these dynamics, we propose a novel circuit model that includes separate negative and positive error calculations within narrowly tuned auditory streams, with prediction error neurons laterally interconnected between adjacent streams. This architecture not only accounts for the observed asymmetry and probability encoding in sensory processing but also demonstrates how lateral connections can enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction-encoding, a concept supported by the free energy principle [1,3]. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of negative prediction error neurons in the auditory cortex and propose a circuit-level hypothesis for how these errors might be computed and integrated within cortical microcircuits. In this study, we focused on the right auditory cortex of Urethane-anesthetized rats, utilizing extracellular recordings to monitor responses to auditory stimuli. Across 18 electrode penetrations involving 10 rats, we successfully captured the activity of 990 single units. For each rat, we first used a surface microelectrode array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (Fig 1A) to map the various parts of the auditory cortex (Fig 1B) [29–31]. We then used a Neuropixels electrode array to record different layers of the chosen area for each penetration (Fig 1C).

The same representation is used as in panel E. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g001 To explore the neural response to auditory stimuli and their omission, we devised eight experimental conditions (Fig 1D). Each condition featured an oddball sequence of two tones with distinct probabilities, along with a consistent occurrence of tone omissions at a rate of 5%. To create varied prediction contents while maintaining a fixed omission rate, we utilized two tones and controlled their relative predictability. We selected two distinct pure tones (denoted as Tones A and B), one octave apart, that consistently elicited responses from most neurons for each penetration (see details in “Methods”). The sequences were systematically designed but presented in a random order. Each sequence comprised 1,000 stimulus items, including omissions, and featured Tones A and B at varying probabilities to achieve distinct levels of predictability. The specific ratios of Tones A and B were carefully controlled as follows: 95% Tone A and 0% Tone B (exclusively Tone A), 90% and 5%, 85% and 10%, and 75% and 20%. This pattern continued, adjusting further to 20% and 75%, 10% and 85%, 5% and 90%, until reaching 0% and 95% (exclusively Tone B). We observed diverse patterns of neural responses to omissions. Fig 1E and 1F illustrate responses from three exemplary neurons to tone omissions during two distinct tone sequences: one with 95% Tone A and 5% omissions, and the other with 95% Tone B and 5% omissions. Some neurons exhibited strong responses when either tone was presented but did not respond to their omission (Fig 1E), and some neurons displayed selective responses to the absence of specific tones, with the intensity and nature of these responses varying depending on which tone was omitted (Fig 1F). To determine whether omission responses encode negative prediction errors, we investigated how neurons’ responses to omissions were modulated by the predictability of the omitted stimuli. For neurons encoding negative prediction errors, their response should correlate with the content of the prediction. In our experimental design, the content is determined by the probabilities of the two tones, which is equivalent to the probability of one tone, since their total is fixed at 95%. Therefore, we first evaluated which neurons’ omission response correlated with the probability of tone presentation. The omission response was defined as the neuron’s mean firing rate during a 5–120 ms window after the omission, with a local baseline subtracted on a per-trial basis. This baseline was calculated as the mean firing rate from –24 to 5 ms relative to the expected tone onset, capturing the neuron’s state just before the tone was omitted [32]. We then computed the Spearman’s correlation between each neuron’s average omission response under each condition and the corresponding probability of tone presentation (either Tone A or B). For each neuron, the tone whose omission response increased with higher probability was designated the “omission preferred” (OP) tone, while the other was termed the “omission non-preferred” (ONP) tone. Under this definition, the correlation coefficients measured against the OP tone were all positive, unlike those measured against the ONP tone, which would be negative. Next, we examined whether distinct groups exist based on how strongly each neuron’s omission response correlated with predictability of the OP tone. To achieve this, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients and used an unbiased elbow analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters (see details in “Methods”). The elbow analysis revealed that it is optimal to cluster the data into two distinct neuronal subpopulations (see the elbow analysis in S1 Fig): one comprising 771 neurons with little or no modulation of omission responses by tone probability (mean Spearman’s ρ = 0.048), and a second comprising 219 neurons exhibiting a robust positive correlation (mean ρ = 0.18) (Fig 2A).

The p-value shown below reflects the result of a bootstrap analysis comparing the observed PEON count in each area to a simulated null distribution; the asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g002 Fig 2B illustrates the omission responses of two example neurons across eight different conditions. These range from scenarios with 0% OP tone (95% ONP and 5% omission) to scenarios with 95% OP tone (0% ONP and 5% omission). The peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), aligned to the expected onset of the omitted tone, have been baseline-subtracted to isolate the omission response. Neuron 1 (from Cluster 1 in Fig 2A) exhibited only a weak correlation (Spearman’s ρ = 0.12), while Neuron 2 (from Cluster 2) showed a pronounced increase in omission response as the probability of the OP tone increased (rho = 0.36). To further examine these PEONs without introducing double-dipping biases, we conducted a split-data analysis by dividing trials into two independent subsets (odd and even trials, denoted as ODD and EVEN trials) to ensure the robustness of our analyses. All PEONs were identified using only one half (e.g., ODD) and subsequently tested on the complementary half (e.g., EVEN), ensuring that selection and evaluation were fully independent. Using the ODD trials, we identified 123 PEONs according to two criteria: (1) a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between their omission responses and the probability of the corresponding OP tone, as verified by Spearman’s correlation test; and (2) a significant omission response (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon sign‐rank test) to this OP tone in the four conditions where it was presented as standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), when the OP tone is most predictable and omission responses should be greatest (see details in “Methods”). We refer to these PEONs as PEONODD. To confirm the reliability of our selection criteria and ensure that the identified neurons were not specific to one trial subset, we applied the same classification procedure to the EVEN trials, identifying a separate group of PEONs referred to as PEONEVEN. For additional comparison, maximizing statistical power and evaluating probability encoding without trial-based data splitting, we identified PEONALL, a group classified using all available trials. Out of a total of 990 neurons, we identified 123 (13%) PEONODD, 60 neurons (6%) showed correlation with probability but no omission response, and 807 neurons (82%) showed no correlation (Fig 2C, top). On the other hand, when using the EVEN trials, 145 neurons were classified as PEONEVEN, 69 showed correlation but no response, and 776 showed no correlation. Although the precise numbers varied slightly between subsets, the classification proportions were broadly similar, supporting the robustness of the procedure. To assess consistency more directly, we quantified the overlap between the two independently identified PEON subsets. A total of 61 neurons were classified as PEONs in both ODD and EVEN trial sets, significantly exceeding the overlap expected by chance (expected: 18 neurons; hypergeometric test, p << 0.001). This result supports the stability of the classification approach, even when applied to trial-split subsets with reduced statistical power. For comparison, when using all trials without splitting, 200 neurons were classified as PEONALL, 70 showed correlation but no response, and 720 showed no correlation. Pie charts for both PEONEVEN and PEONALL classifications are shown in S2 Fig. Fig 2D presents a box plot that aggregates the omission response of all PEONODD on EVEN trials. To quantify the relationship between omission response and OP tone probability, we performed a direct Spearman’s correlation analysis using all individual neuron data points, which revealed a significant positive relationship (Spearman’s ρ = 0.34, p = 1.6 × 10−27, n = 984, representing 123 neurons × 8 probability conditions). The strength of this relationship indicates that neural responses systematically increase as the probability of the OP tone increases, providing strong evidence that these neurons encode stimulus probability. This significant relationship confirmed the robustness of the probability-encoding property, which is likewise replicated in the analysis of PEONEVEN on ODD trials and PEONALL using all trials (see S2 Fig). From here onward, we present the results from the PEONODD group. Equivalent analyses for PEONEVEN and PEONALL are provided in the S2–S5 Figs to further support the robustness and generalizability of our findings. To investigate the anatomical basis of predictive coding in the auditory system, we analyzed the laminar and areal distribution of PEONODD. We used current source density (CSD) analysis of local field potential (LFP) responses to determine cortical layer depths and categorized neurons into layers based on established criteria (see “Methods”). Fig 2E illustrates the distribution of these neurons across cortical depths, demonstrating that PEONODD are distributed across all cortical layers, with a higher proportion found in the supragranular (16.2%) and granular (13.4%) layers compared to the infragranular layers (9.8%). A similar distribution was also discovered from PEONEVEN and PEONALL (see S3 Fig). To assess whether these distributions differed significantly from a random distribution, we performed a two-sided bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. The analysis revealed a marginal trend in the supragranular layer (p = 0.058) and a significant difference in the infragranular layer (p = 0.029), whereas the granular layer did not show a significant deviation (p = 0.62). Further examination of these results indicated that PEONs were present at a lower-than-expected rate in the infragranular layer. We similarly examined neuron distribution across different auditory fields, summarized in Fig 2F, using bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. This analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of PEONs in A1 (p = 0.0036), whereas VAF (p = 0.9442) and AAF (p = 0.9926) did not show significant deviations from the distribution expected under the null hypothesis. Further examination suggested that PEONs were present at a higher-than-expected rate specifically in A1 relative to the other auditory fields. To confirm that PEONs encode negative prediction errors, it is essential to show that their responses to omissions increase over time as predictions are gradually formed, reflecting a growing discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcomes. We analyzed PEONODD from EVEN trials and focused on omissions of the OP tone in sequences where it was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), and therefore expected to evoke the largest omission responses. We grouped these responses by their sequence position and computed the mean firing rate (±standard error) for each bin. This grouping tests whether the omission response increases as more tones precede the omission, which is the expected pattern if these neurons are indeed signaling a negative prediction error that strengthens with increasing prediction. Our analysis revealed a notable pattern: the magnitude of the PEONs response to these omissions progressively increased throughout the sequence, achieving a steady state or plateau after approximately 400 standards were presented (Fig 3A). The dynamics of the trial-by-trial omission response were fitted by a logistic growth curve, expressed as: (A) Firing rate of PEONODD for omission events (on EVEN trials) in the four conditions where the OP tone was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%), grouped by sequence position. The x-axis represents the bin center (i.e., its sequence position), and the y-axis represents the firing rate in spikes per second. The black dots indicate the mean firing rate across all PEONODD for each bin, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), showing variability across neurons. The blue line represents the logistic growth curve fit to the data, illustrating how omission responses evolve over successive standards. Data were averaged across sequences where the OP tone was the standard (95%, 90%, 85%, and 75%). (B) Firing rate of PEONODD in response to the presentation of tones across the first 50 trials.

The black dots indicate the mean firing rate across all PEONODD for each trial, and the error bars represent SEM, showing variability across neurons. The blue line represents the exponential decay model’s fit to the data, indicating a rapid decline in response intensity over the initial trials as the neurons adapt to the repeated tone presentations.

The logistic function depicts a saturating increase in response magnitude. Here, an R2 value of 0.51 indicates the model’s moderate success in capturing the variability in responses. To demonstrate that the observed increase in omission response was not caused by gradual changes in network activation over time, we also examined how PEONs responded to standard tones over the first 50 trials (Fig 3B). The results indicated a rapid decline in response intensity over successive trials. This decay was fitted using an exponential decay model: where is the firing rate at trial . An R2 value of 0.75, indicating a substantial fit to the data. As expected, this encapsulates the phenomenon of stimulus-specific adaptation or a decrease in positive prediction error, where the response to an expected stimulus diminishes rapidly. These trends were consistent also for PEONEVEN during ODD trials and PEONALL over all trials (see S4 Fig). Finally, we investigated whether PEONs are exclusively responsive to omissions or if they also react to tone stimuli. The population responses of PEONODD from EVEN trials revealed a pronounced asymmetry in omission and tone responses (Fig 4A, top). Omission responses showed tone selectivity based on probability: as described before for PEONODD, the response strength systematically increased with the probability of the OP tone. In contrast, tone-evoked responses for both OP and ONP tones exhibited an inverse relationship with probability. Specifically, the response to the OP tone (blue line) decreased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = –0.19, p = 2.1 × 10−8, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), showing adaptation to the increasingly standard OP tone (Fig 4A, bottom). Similarly, the response to the ONP tone (orange line) increased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = 0.20, p = 6.7 × 10−9, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), which means it also shows an inverse relationship with probability, but with respect to the ONP tone’s own decreasing probability, reflecting deviant detection of the increasingly rare ONP tone. In essence, PEONs selectively signal negative prediction errors only for OP tone omissions, while their responses to both tones exhibit symmetrical adaptation to the standard tone and deviant detection of the deviant tone, without tone-specific selectivity in the direction of probability modulation.

These neurons were divided into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g004 When examining individual neurons, we found that, as expected from the definition of PEONs, their omission responses were highly selective. A substantial proportion of PEONs detected the absence of one tone while responding to both. This is illustrated in Fig 4B, which shows the responses on EVEN trials of an example PEONODD. This neuron’s omission response (left column) increased with OP probability, exhibiting robust firing at high probabilities (90%–95%). Despite its selective omission response, it showed significant responses to both OP tone (center column) and ONP tone (right column), especially when the tone probabilities were low (5%–10%). To ensure that the selectivity observed in omission responses is not merely due to residual effects from the previous trial’s tone responses—such as lingering activity or altered baseline activity—we verified that omission selectivity is independent of tone selectivity. To do this, we measured the omission selectivity index (OSI) and the tone selectivity index (TSI) for each PEON (see details in “Methods”). The results showed no significant correlation between OSI and TSI across the PEON population (Spearman’s ρ = –0.03, p = 0.78, n = 123 neurons). This lack of correlation indicates that a PEON’s preference for a specific tone (e.g., Tone A over Tone B) does not predict its preference for the omission of that tone. Therefore, omission selectivity was not a residual effect from the previous trials. To quantify this selectivity across the population, we examined how many PEONs exhibited significant omission responses under different conditions. Out of 123 PEONODD, 90 demonstrated significant OP-omission responses in EVEN trials (with an additional 5 showing significant responses only to ONP omissions). Of these 90 neurons with OP omission responses, 59 (66%) were selective for OP omissions, whereas 31 (34%) were non-selective, exhibiting significant omission responses for both tones (Fig 4C, left). To further characterize the omission-selective group, we examined their responses to tone presentations to determine whether they responded exclusively to one tone or to both (Fig 4C, right), 41 (or 69%) exhibited significant responses to both the OP and ONP tones across experimental conditions (see details in “Methods”). Additionally, 3 PEONs responded exclusively to the OP tone, 9 solely to the ONP tone, and 6 did not significantly respond to either tone. Similar trends in tone responses were observed when validating PEONEVEN validated on ODD trials and in PEONALL (see S5 Fig). In both cases, most omission-selective neurons responded to both tones, while smaller subsets responded exclusively to one tone or to neither. This consistency across datasets further supports the robustness of the omission response selectivity and its relationship to tone-evoked activity. In summary, these characteristic responses—observed in a considerable subpopulation of individual PEONs, which are selective for omissions but broadly responsive to tones—mirror the population responses and indicate an intriguing functional asymmetry. This raises the question of how computational principles and circuitry give rise to this phenomenon. To further understand how PEONs, which we presume to be negative prediction-error neurons, can display this observed asymmetry in top–down and bottom–up processing, we developed a neural circuit model consisting of multiple streams within a “predictive-coding module” (Fig 5A). This model was based on the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes a circuit module that integrates negative prediction error computation [6]. (A) Basic circuit module showing interconnections between neurons.

(E) Distance-dependent properties of lateral connections, showing delay and weight as a function of the distance between streams (see more details in “Methods”). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g005 Each predictive-coding module includes six leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons divided into two streams: one stream calculates the positive prediction error and upregulates the prediction, while the other stream calculates the negative prediction error and downregulates the prediction. A sensory neuron (denoted as I) receives the sensory signal and propagates the information in a bottom–up manner. In contrast, a prediction neuron (P) receives the prediction signal and propagates the information in a top–down manner. A positive prediction-error neuron (PE+) receives excitatory synaptic input from the sensory neuron and is suppressed by the prediction neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I+). Conversely, a negative prediction-error neuron (PE–) receives excitatory synaptic input from the prediction neuron and is suppressed by the sensory neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I–). All synaptic connections are static synapses that include three variables: synaptic weight, time constant, and synaptic delay (see details in “Methods”). The activity of PE+ enhances the prediction signal through excitatory analog feedback, while the activity of PE– suppresses the prediction signal via inhibitory analog feedback. In our simulation, the sensory signal was designed to replicate the experiment, featuring an analog pulse stimulus with an intensity of S_strength (ranging between 0 and 1) and a duration of 20 ms, delivered with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 150 ms (see Fig 5B, top). Conversely, the prediction signal was modeled as a similar analog pulse as the sensory signal, but varied in intensity (P_strength), which could be enhanced by excitatory feedback from PE+ or diminished by inhibitory feedback from PE– (Fig 5B, bottom). It is important to recognize that our model assumes the temporal profile of the prediction signal is learned through a separate mechanism, while the predictive-coding module adjusts only the signal’s magnitude based on prediction error. Predictive coding modules from different streams, each processing a specific frequency according to a tonotopic organization, are interconnected through lateral excitatory synaptic connections. These connections run from PE+ of one module to PE– of another (as illustrated between streams A and B in Fig 5C). Intuitively, this setup enables PEONs, represented as PE–, in one stream to respond to stimuli in another stream, endowing them with a broader bottom–up receptive field. Moreover, this configuration allows an unexpected stimulus in one stream to inhibit the predictive signal in other streams. For example, as shown in Fig 5C, if the sensory signal in Stream B is unexpected, PE+ in Stream B will activate, causing PE– in Stream A to also activate through the lateral connection. This activation will then suppress the predictive signal in Stream A. Thus, when an unexpected Tone B is detected, indicating that Tone A (or other tones) is unlikely, the prediction for Tone A (or other tones) is consequently reduced. Conversely, since the absence of an expected Tone B does not necessarily suggest the presence of Tone A (or other tones), our model does not include lateral connections running from PE– to PE+. Our comprehensive model includes five streams: Stream 2 is tuned to detect the OP tone (Tone A), while Stream 4 detects the ONP tone (Tone B) (see Fig 5D). The model incorporates a simple receptive field structure for sensory signals. Specifically, Stream 2 receives Tone A at full strength (S_strength = 1), whereas the adjacent Streams 1 and 3 receive Tone A at half strength (S_strength = 0.5). Similarly, Stream 4 receives Tone B at full strength, and the adjacent Streams 3 and 5 receive Tone B at half strength. Additionally, the model features lateral excitatory connections between streams that are distance-specific (Fig 5E). The synaptic delay between any two streams is proportional to their spatial separation, and the synaptic weight decreases with the inverse square of their distance (see more details in “Methods”). We conducted multiple simulations using the model, each featuring unique probability combinations of tones A and B, along with a consistent 5% omission rate, mirroring the conditions of our rodent experiments. Each simulation included 500 stimuli—either tone A, B, or an omission (O)—across a total of 75 s. Importantly, every simulation began with no initial predictions across all streams (P_strength = 0). Here, we demonstrate the model’s responses using the example where the sensory inputs consist of 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, randomly ordered as shown in Fig 6A. The spiking activities of Neurons I, P, PE+, and PE− across the five streams are illustrated in Fig 6B. Notably, Neuron P began firing after a few seconds, particularly in Streams 1–3, which are responsive to Tone A. This activity indicated that the prediction for Tone A was beginning to be established. Consequently, the positive prediction error, reflected by PE+’s spiking activity, began to diminish. Additionally, the spiking activity of PE−, primarily associated with the omission of Tone A, was also observed in Streams 4 and 5. This was largely due to lateral connections from PE+ in Streams 1–3. The prediction signals across the five streams, detailed in Fig 6C, show that P_strength increased and plateaued in Streams 1–3, caused by PE+’s firing, with Stream 2 displaying the highest value.

Our goal was to reproduce the experimentally observed asymmetry: selective responses to omissions of the preferred tone, but broad responses to both tones. The raster plots of this PEON, presented in Fig 6D for a simulation containing 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, characterize responses to different stimuli: Tones A, B, and omissions O. The PSTH reveals that while the PEON consistently responded to omissions, it did not respond to Tone A (in later trials), which was anticipated. Importantly, the PEON did respond to Tone B, a response enabled by lateral connections. In Fig 6E, we present raster plots from a different simulation with 5% A, 90% B, and 5% O. Similar to the previous simulation, the PEON in Stream 2 responded to Tone B via lateral connections. It also reacted to Tone A, facilitated by the lateral connections from nearby Streams 1 and 3, where PE+ was activated by the deviant Tone A. Notably, there was no response to omissions, as the prediction in Stream A was not effectively established due to the minimal occurrence of only 5% A. In conclusion, the PEON in Stream 2 demonstrated the asymmetry of receptive fields in bottom–up sensory and top–down predictive processing, reflecting the findings in the rodent experiment. Note that this asymmetry requires that the weights of the lateral excitatory connections from nearby neurons (as shown in Fig 5E) exceed the inhibitory weights within the module (see S1 Table). This setup ensures that sensory inputs from the neighboring streams can overcome inhibition to elicit a response on PEONs. When the number of lateral neighbor neurons increases (there are only two in our model), reduced excitatory weights can remain effective. Furthermore, we believe these lateral connections could be activity-dependent (e.g., via spike-timing-dependent plasticity) and further refined through self-organization. However, this lies beyond the scope of our current study. To assess the validity of the proposed model with lateral connections (the model labeled “Lateral PE+ to PE–”), we evaluated two alternative models and compared their predictions against the experimental data. The alternatives included: a model with lateral connections from Neuron I to PE– across different streams (termed “Lateral I to PE–”, depicted in Fig 7A), and a model with no lateral connections at all (referred to as “No lateral”). For each model, we measured the responses of the PEON in Stream 2 to Tones A, B, and omission O under different probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)): from 0% (95% B and 5%O) to 95% (0% B and 5%O). The results are shown in Fig 7B, together with the correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A).

(B) Evaluation of alternative models: Lateral PE+ to PE–, Lateral I to PE–, and No Lateral.

Top panels show the firing rates of PEON in Stream 2 in response to Tone A (red), Tone B (blue), and omissions (O, gray) across varying probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)). Bottom panels display correlations between firing rates and probabilities for Tones A, B, and omissions for each model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g007 In our proposed model, the PEON’s response to omission significantly correlated with Prob(A) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.79, p = 2.1 × 10−108, n = 500 trials; see “Methods” for further details), indicating that the PEON did encode the probability of the stimulus within its stream. For Tone A, the PEON exhibited reduced responses as Prob(A) increased, demonstrating a significant negative correlation between firing rate and Prob(A) (r = –0.73, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). This occurred because PE+ in nearby Streams 1 and 3 detected less surprise at higher Prob(A) values, leading to less activation of the PEON in Stream 2 through lateral connections (as also noted in Fig 5E). Conversely, for Tone B, the PEON’s response positively correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10-250, n = 4,750 trials). At higher Prob(A) values, Tone B emerged as the deviant tone. This led to an enhanced detection of surprise by PE+ near Stream 4 for Tone B, which subsequently activated the PEON in Stream 2 more strongly through lateral connections. In the alternative “Lateral I to PE–” model, the PEON’s response to omission was also correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 500 trials). For Tone A, unlike the proposed model, the PEON in Stream 2 did not exhibit decreased responses at high Prob(A) values. This occurred because the PEON directly received sensory input from Neuron I, which remained unchanged across different Prob(A) settings. Despite this, a positive correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A) was observed (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 4,750 trials). This was due to slightly increased responses from Neuron I in nearby Streams 1 and 3, which were caused by an elevated membrane potential resulting from frequent stimulation by Tone A. Conversely, for Tone B, the opposite effect occurred: Neuron I near Stream 4 showed an increase in membrane potential due to frequent stimulation of Tone B at low Prob(A) levels. Therefore, despite only minor changes in firing rate across different Prob(A) values, a negative correlation was observed (r = –0.42, p = 3.5 × 10−204, n = 4,750 trials). In the alternative “No lateral” model, the PEON’s response to omission correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.38, p = 9.2e−19, n = 500 trials), as this encoding occurs within the stream without the need for lateral connections. For Tone A, the PEON displayed no responses, which was anticipated since it could only react to an omission in the absence of lateral connections. For Tone B, the PEON exhibited similar responses as to omissions, since in Stream 2, any stimulation differing from Tone A was treated as an omission. Consequently, a similar positive correlation was observed (r = 0.58, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). To validate these models, each demonstrating unique encoding characteristics, we compared them to data from our rodent experiment. In our analysis, Tones A and B corresponded to the OP and ONP Tones, respectively. The correlation patterns we observed in our experimental data (see Fig 4A) align closely with the predictions of our proposed model. The positive correlation for omission responses, negative correlation for responses to OP tone, and positive correlation for responses to ONP tone are all successfully captured by the model with lateral PE+ to PE− connections. These results support the proposed model with its lateral connections facilitating positive prediction errors, distinguishing it from the alternative models. The models discussed so far have not taken into account that the strength of sensory signals could diminish due to frequent exposure to a specific stimulus. To address this, we analyzed responses from neurons in the thalamus (n = 130 neurons) across various probabilities of the OP Tone (see S6A Fig and “Methods” for details). Accordingly, we modeled the sensory signal strength, S_strength, as a function of Prob(A) (S6B Fig) and conducted simulations. By simulating various levels of sensory adaptation (see “Methods”), our results reaffirmed that only the proposed model successfully replicated the probability encoding characteristics observed in the rodent data (S6C Fig). Our next step was to explore the potential computational benefits of the proposed lateral connections, particularly in terms of enhancing prediction encoding. How do these connections influence prediction signals? Without lateral connections, not only would Stream 2 predict Tone A, but also the neighboring streams (e.g., Stream 1), due to their broad sensory receptive fields receiving half-strength sensory signals. However, with lateral connections, these predictions are reduced not only by the omission of Tone A but also by the presence of Tone B. Particularly, we theorized that this additional reduction would suppress the already low prediction signals in the neighboring streams. This leads to a scenario where the prediction signal is predominantly strong in Stream 2, thus resulting in a more precise encoding of Prob(A) across streams. To test this, we first assessed the steady value of P_strength after the prediction signal stabilized across various stimulation sequences (as in Fig 6C). These sequences varied Prob(A) from 0% to 95%, with increments of 1%. In Fig 8A, we plotted the time courses of P_strength for each 75-s simulation under different Prob(A) settings, focusing on Stream 2, where our target PEON was situated, and the adjacent Stream 1. For comparison, the time courses for Streams 1 and 2 in the model without lateral connections (“No lateral”) are shown in Fig 8B. The steady value of P_strength was determined by averaging values over the last 50 s (from 25 to 75 s). It was plotted as a function of Prob(A) for both models, with and without lateral connections, across Streams 1 and 2 (as shown in Fig 8C). In both streams, P_strength increased as Prob(A) rose. However, the increase was less pronounced in the model with lateral connections, especially at lower Prob(A) values. We further analyzed the contrast in P_strength between Streams 1 and 2 by calculating the decibel value (logarithmic ratio of P_strength in Stream 2 to that in Stream 1). This contrast was significantly greater in the model with lateral connections compared to the model without, particularly when Prob(A) was less than 0.5 (Fig 8D). This suggested that the lateral connections enhance the contrast of prediction signals across streams.

This is supported by the observation that P_strength was generally lower with lateral connections (as shown in Fig 8C). To investigate this further, we measured P_strength across Prob(A) for all streams in both models (Fig 8E) and then calculated the average P_strength across streams for each Prob(A) setting (Fig 8F). The findings suggest that with lateral connections, the network requires less “energy” or smaller prediction signals to effectively encode sequences, particularly in less predictable scenarios where the occurrences of Tones A and B are equal, such as Prob(A) = 0.5. This demonstrates a more efficient encoding strategy. Conversely, without lateral connections, the network expends more energy to manage more unpredictable sequences. This study aimed to understand how negative prediction-error neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond. We combined electrophysiological recordings with computational modeling to demonstrate an asymmetry in prediction-error signaling, which we attribute to “lateral prediction suppression” where positive and negative prediction errors interact through lateral connections to enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding. Omission paradigms are a powerful tool for isolating negative prediction-error signals, as they eliminate the confounding influence of sensory input present in positive prediction error paradigms (e.g., oddball sequences). In human studies using EEG and MEG, mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to unexpected omissions in tone sequences have been reported, which are interpreted as evidence for predictive coding mechanisms [17,20,22–24,33]. More recently, single-neuron recordings in animals have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying these auditory prediction errors. Studies have reported omission-responsive neurons in the auditory cortex of both awake and anesthetized rodents. One study found that 35.6% of neurons in awake animals and 19.5% of neurons in anesthetized rats and mice exhibited significant responses to the omission of expected tones [34,35]. Another study, using more complex stimuli involving the omission of expected gaps within auditory sequences, also demonstrated robust omission responses in unanesthetized rats [25]. Alongside these auditory findings, multiple studies in mouse visual cortex have documented sensorimotor prediction-error signals, specifically negative prediction errors, in response to unexpected reductions in expected sensory input [7,36,37]. These studies demonstrate that neurons in V1 exhibit negative mismatch responses when expected visual flow is weakened or omitted during locomotion. A molecularly distinct population of neurons in V1 has been identified that selectively responds to unexpected omissions of predicted visual stimuli [9] Extending this sensorimotor framework to the auditory system, a recent study showed that neurons in the auditory cortex responded to unexpected reductions in movement-contingent sound within a virtual reality environment, signaling a negative prediction error [28]. Building upon this foundation, our study’s conceptual advance stems from our paradigm design that systematically varies tone probabilities while maintaining consistent omission rates, allowing us to characterize negative prediction error as a continuous, probability-encoding mechanism rather than simply a binary deviance detector. This approach also reveals the dynamic nature of these prediction signals, which develop gradually through repeated exposure to statistical patterns in the environment. The subsequent sections will explore how these findings, along with our observations of asymmetry in predictive processing, led us to develop a circuit-level model that offers a new perspective on information flow in predictive coding networks. Our model builds upon the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes predictive coding as a canonical cortical computation [6]. Their model emphasizes hierarchical processing with distinct neuron populations computing positive and negative prediction errors. Consistent with this framework, our findings provide evidence for both types of prediction error in the rat auditory cortex. While we focused on characterizing negative prediction errors in PEONs, we also observed oddball responses in the broader population of non-PEON neurons (S7 Fig), with enhanced responses to unexpected tones. Since such responses have been interpreted as positive prediction-error signals in previous studies, we infer that at least some of these neurons encode positive prediction error [16,18,38–41]. More importantly, our model additionally describes how predictive coding modules, which process bidirectional information, interact both vertically and horizontally across sensory streams. This provides a means for prediction errors to integrate across bottom–up receptive fields. Moreover, we hypothesize that there is also a receptive field for top–down signaling. Traditionally, a neuron’s receptive field is defined by the range of external stimuli that can directly evoke its activity, a concept rooted in bottom–up sensory processing. However, neurons like PEONs are influenced not only by bottom–up sensory input but also by prediction signals generated in other brain areas. Therefore, their effective response properties – what we might term their “predictive field” – are shaped also by the specificity of the prediction. We believe that the asymmetry between the bottom–up receptive field and the top–down predictive field provides a means to integrate predictions and prediction errors, and that it could be inverted (i.e., a larger predictive field than receptive field) at other hierarchical levels. Our circuit model proposes that unexpected stimuli in one frequency stream inhibit predictive signals in adjacent streams via lateral prediction suppression. This enhances the contrast between the predicted frequency and others, sharpening the prediction signal and facilitating more efficient updates to the internal model, conceptually analogous to lateral inhibition in sensory systems, which serves to enhance the contrast of bottom–up sensory input [42]. That is, the lateral prediction suppression we propose for the top–down predictive field is functionally analogous to lateral inhibition in the bottom–up receptive field. Biological evidence strongly supports the existence of excitatory lateral connections between adjacent frequency channels in A1. These connections play a crucial role in spectral integration and the processing of complex auditory stimuli [43–45]. Anatomical studies have revealed that pyramidal neurons in A1 exhibit long-range horizontal collaterals that form connections across different frequency representations, often aligning with isofrequency bands [46,47]. Physiological investigations have demonstrated that these intracortical pathways contribute significantly to the breadth of subthreshold frequency receptive fields, which can span up to five octaves [48,49]. The strength and probability of these connections are distance-dependent, with stronger and more probable connections between neurons tuned to close frequencies, weakening as the frequency distance increases [50,51]. This organized network of lateral connections facilitates the integration of spectral information across different frequency channels, supporting complex auditory processing and cortical plasticity in A1. Similar patterns of lateral connectivity have been observed in other sensory modalities, such as orientation-specific connections in visual cortex [52] and whisker-related connections in somatosensory barrel cortex [53], suggesting a common organizational principle across different sensory areas. The development of these lateral connections might involve both innate and learned components. While the basic framework of these connections may be genetically predetermined, their refinement occurs during early postnatal development through experience-dependent plasticity [54]. This developmental process allows for the fine-tuning of these connections based on sensory experience, optimizing the auditory cortex for processing the specific acoustic environment encountered during critical periods of development. In our model, the one-way excitation from PE+ to PE− neurons allows for rapid recalibration of expectations across streams. This asymmetry enables efficient updating of predictions based on positive surprises while avoiding false alarms from mere absences. Integration across frequency channels enables complex interactions, with sequences of tones providing predictive information about subsequent tones. Naturalistic sounds like tone clouds can activate multiple streams simultaneously, leveraging the network’s capacity for sophisticated auditory processing [55]. Building upon these anatomical and functional observations of lateral connectivity, we can consider how our proposed circuit model might be interpreted through theoretical principles. The free energy principle [1,56] potentially offers an elegant explanatory framework for understanding why these lateral connections may have evolved. Could the lateral prediction suppression we observed be more than just a convenient circuit mechanism? When viewed through the lens of free energy minimization, these connections might represent an optimal solution for efficient predictive processing. In S1 Text, we provide a mathematical treatment that suggests when a simplified form of the free energy principle is applied to a two-tone paradigm similar to our experimental design, lateral interactions between prediction errors across different streams emerge naturally from the formalism. In our mathematical exploration, we considered a simplified generative model where auditory tones at different frequencies are represented as hidden variables with linear relationships to sensory inputs. By deriving the update rules for prediction signals under free energy minimization, we found that the resulting equations comprise three key components: updates based on prediction errors within the same frequency stream, lateral interactions of prediction errors across different frequency streams, and a temporal decay term. Notably, the lateral interaction term emerges from the correlation structure of sensory inputs across different frequencies—a statistical regularity well-documented in natural auditory environments [57]. These theoretical derivations align remarkably well with our proposed circuit model, where lateral connections between PE+ and PE− neurons across different frequency streams play a crucial role in shaping prediction signals. This theoretical perspective raises intriguing possibilities about why the brain might implement the asymmetric receptive fields we observed. The efficient coding strategy—where unexpected stimuli in one frequency channel not only signal prediction errors within that channel but also laterally modulate predictions in neighboring channels—could represent an evolutionarily advantageous solution for minimizing computational costs while maximizing predictive accuracy. Such a theoretical framing might also explain the directionality of lateral connections we proposed, flowing primarily from positive to negative prediction error neurons rather than bidirectionally. While experimental validation of these theoretical predictions remains a challenge for future work, the mathematical alignment between our empirical findings and free energy principles suggests that lateral prediction suppression could be a fundamental computational motif in predictive processing, potentially extending beyond the auditory system to other sensory modalities. Our finding that PEONs are more prevalent in granular and supragranular layers aligns with current views on the laminar organization of predictive coding circuits [4]. These layers are thought to be primary sites for prediction error computation and integration of top–down predictions with bottom–up sensory input. The relative scarcity of PEONs in infragranular layers suggests these neurons may be less involved in generating feedback predictions to earlier processing stages. Regarding their distribution across different auditory fields (A1, VAF, AAF), while PEONs were present in all areas examined, they showed a significantly higher proportion in A1 compared to VAF and AAF (based on bootstrap analysis). This potential enrichment in A1 might suggest functional specializations within primary auditory cortex related to negative prediction error signals, although the presence of PEONs across fields still supports the idea that predictive coding is a widespread cortical computation [6]. However, this raises questions about potential functional specializations not captured by our current paradigm. A notable feature of the PEON omission responses is their shape; rather than exhibiting a sharp, transient peak as seen in typical tone responses, they often display a more gradual onset and prolonged duration [27,32,34] compared to both typical auditory evoked responses and the idealized, instantaneous prediction-error signals assumed in simplified predictive coding models, including our own. While our model effectively captures the probability encoding and asymmetry of PEON responses, it does not explicitly model the detailed temporal dynamics. Functionally, a more gradual negative prediction-error signal might help prevent drastic responses to slightly delayed expected input—contrasting with the rapid responses needed for unexpected stimuli. Furthermore, the negative prediction-error signal could reflect a prediction not only about the content (i.e., the tone) but also about its timing. In other words, the prediction signal could be gradually ramped up according to a hazard function, modeling how the brain adjusts its anticipation of an event as time passes [58–61], and the negative prediction-error signal could follow a similar pattern. We suspect that this ramp-up response involves a recurrent cortical circuit normally inhibited by sensory input; when the input is omitted and disinhibition occurs, the negative prediction-error signal gradually increases. Future computational modeling that explicitly incorporates recurrent connectivity and temporal integration mechanisms will be crucial for elucidating the precise neural mechanisms underlying this observed latency. A notable limitation of our study is the absence of explicit “prediction neurons” in both our experimental findings and computational model. While we identified neurons responding to prediction errors, we did not find neurons directly representing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Predictive signals might be generated in higher-order auditory areas, non-auditory regions providing top–down input, or encoded in a distributed manner across neuronal populations. Further computational modeling of distributed prediction encoding could help guide future experiments by suggesting specific patterns or population-level dynamics to look for in neural data. It is important to consider whether the observed omission responses might themselves be a prediction signal, rather than solely a prediction error. However, several aspects of the PEON activity argue against this interpretation. First, a prediction signal should precede the expected time of the stimulus, while PEON omission responses occur after the expected tone onset. Second, prediction signals should appear consistently across all trials, regardless of whether the stimulus is presented or omitted. Instead, we observe that PEONs exhibit markedly different activity patterns between presentation and omission trials—in some cases showing smaller responses when tones are presented compared to when they are omitted. Thus, the PEON activity pattern is more consistent with a negative prediction-error signal, reflecting the mismatch between expectation and reality, rather than just the expectation itself. Future research should address the limitations of our study, such as the potential effects of anesthesia on neural responses, by comparing findings with those from awake and behaving animals. Additionally, employing more complex stimuli and varying spectral distances between tones could further probe the limits of the proposed lateral prediction suppression mechanism. Another important direction is identifying the specific neuronal populations involved in prediction-error signaling. While our study focused on firing rate dynamics, different neuronal subtypes may play distinct roles in encoding positive and negative prediction errors. Techniques such as optogenetic tagging, juxtacellular recording, or genetic labeling could help determine whether PEONs correspond primarily to excitatory pyramidal neurons or specific subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, providing critical insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying predictive processing in the auditory cortex. All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines established by the Japanese Physiological Society for the care and use of animals in physiological studies. The experimental protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo (JA21-9). The study involved 10 male Wistar rats, aged 11–12 weeks, and weighing between 250 and 350 gms. The animals were housed in a carefully controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle, ensuring optimal conditions for their well-being. Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the study. To minimize animal suffering, all surgical procedures were conducted under appropriate anesthesia. Upon completion of the experiments, the animals were humanely euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (160 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), following established guidelines for the humane termination of animal studies. The rats were anesthetized using urethane, with an initial dose of 1.5 g/kg administered intraperitoneally and supplementary doses of 0.5 g/kg provided as needed to ensure stable and deep anesthesia. This depth of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of corneal and pedal reflexes. The animals were secured using a custom-made head-holding apparatus. Atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the onset of the procedure to reduce bronchial secretion viscosity. Local anesthetic xylocaine (0.3–0.5 ml) was applied at the incision site before making the skin incision. A needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously into the right forepaw to serve as ground. A small craniotomy was performed near the bregma landmark to place a reference electrode, ensuring electrical contact with the dura. A larger craniotomy was performed over the right auditory cortex (4.0 mm posterior and 6.0 mm lateral to bregma), and the right temporal muscle, cranium, and dura covering the auditory cortex were surgically removed. The exposed cortical surface was kept moist with saline to prevent drying. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid drainage was conducted to minimize cerebral edema. Throughout the experiment, an adequate and stable level of anesthesia was ensured by monitoring the animals’ respiratory rate, heart rate, and hind-paw withdrawal reflexes. Neuronal activity was recorded using both a custom-designed surface microelectrode array [62] and a Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array (IMEC, Belgium) [63]. To record neuronal activity epipially over the auditory cortex, a surface array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) comprising 64 platinum electrodes was employed. Each electrode had a diameter of 100 μm and a center-to-center distance of 500 μm, covering an area of 4.5 × 3.0 mm. The array featured 0.3-mm diameter holes between the electrodes to allow the insertion of a Neuropixels array. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded using amplifiers with a gain of 1,000, a digital filter bandpass of 0.3–500 Hz, and a sampling frequency of 1 kHz, employing the Cerebus Data Acquisition System (Blackrock Microsystems LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). We mapped the click-evoked responses to pinpoint the location of the auditory cortex (AC). A click was defined as a monophasic positive wave lasting 20 ms. 60 clicks were administered at a rate of 1 Hz, and LFPs were recorded. The peak amplitude of the middle-latency auditory-evoked potential (P1) within the first 50 ms following the stimulus onset was measured from the grand averaged LFP. To identify three subfields within the AC—A1, AAF, and VAF—we analyzed the spatial distribution of the P1 response. For recording neuronal activity across different cortical layers, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array [63]. The array features 384 active recording sites (out of 960 sites total) located at the bottom approximately 4 mm of an approximately 10 mm shank (70 µm wide, 24 µm thick, 20 µm electrode spacing), with the reference and ground, shorted together. The probe’s ground and reference pads were soldered to a pin, which was then connected to a skull screw on the animal. Recordings were made in internal reference mode. Data acquisition for the Neuropixels arrays was performed using Neuropixels version 1.0 acquisition hardware, specifically the National Instruments PXIe-1071 chassis and PXI-6133 I/O module for recording analog and digital inputs (Neuropixels version 1.0, IMEC, Belgium). The signal was collected from the most distal 384 recording sites (bank 0) at a 30 kHz sampling rate. Raw voltage traces from the Neuropixels arrays were filtered, amplified, multiplexed, and digitized on-probe. Data acquisition and initial processing were managed using Open Ephys software (www.open-ephys.org). Spike sorting was conducted using Kilosort 3 [64], and further manual curation was performed with Phy software (https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This process involved removing artifacts, merging duplicate clusters, and discarding units with insufficient refractory periods, intermingled waveforms, or unstable firing patterns. Only well-isolated neurons meeting strict inclusion criteria were retained for analysis. The cortical depth of the recording site, estimated via CSD analysis, had to be within 0 µm to +1,800 µm from the pial surface. The lower bound of 1,800 µm was chosen to confine recordings to the auditory cortex, preventing the inclusion of neurons from subcortical areas or unintended regions. Additionally, neurons had to fire at least 200 spikes per session to ensure sufficient statistical power, while those exhibiting strong drift in firing rate or waveform shape were excluded to maintain stationarity. To assess the frequency-tuning properties of all recorded neurons, we measured the frequency response area (FRA) at each recording site. The auditory stimuli consisted of pure tone bursts with a 5-ms rise/fall time and a 20-ms steady-state duration. The tones covered a wide range of frequencies, spanning 18 distinct values from 1.6 to 64 kHz, and were presented at seven different sound pressure levels, ranging from 20 to 80 dB SPL in 10-dB steps. In total, 126 unique tone bursts were used to characterize the FRA. The stimuli were delivered in a pseudorandom sequence with an inter-tone interval of 600 ms, and each tone was repeated 20 times. FRA maps were generated for each neuron based on their responses to the presented tones. After examining the FRA maps, we selected two tones that were one octave apart and elicited robust responses from most recorded neurons. These two tones were then used as the stimuli for the subsequent experiments investigating the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions using an intensity well above the threshold of a typical neuron. To investigate the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions, we designed eight experimental conditions, each employing an oddball paradigm with two distinct tones and a fixed 5% probability of tone omissions. The stimuli were the two sinusoidal tones chosen before with a duration of 50 ms, including 5-ms rise and fall ramps. These tones were arranged in sequences of 1,000 stimuli, with an SOA of 150 ms. In the first condition, one tone (Tone A) comprised 95% of the sequence, while the other tone (Tone B) was absent. Across the subsequent conditions, the proportion of Tone B gradually increased by 5% increments, while the proportion of Tone A decreased accordingly. This resulted in the following sequences: This design allowed us to systematically manipulate the relative probabilities of the two tones while maintaining a consistent rate of omissions. By progressively shifting the balance between the tones across conditions, we could examine how the neural responses to tone omissions were influenced by the statistical context provided by the sequence. Omission response was defined as the firing rate measured in a 5–120 ms post‐omission window, with a local baseline subtracted on a per‐trial basis. The baseline was computed as the mean firing rate within a −24 ms to +5 ms window relative to the expected tone onset, a period that closely reflects the neuron’s state immediately prior to the omitted tone and controls for transient adaptations or fluctuations that might occur mid‐sequence. The computed baseline was then subtracted from the mean firing rate obtained during the post‐omission period, yielding a final omission response value that was typically around zero when the neuron exhibited no net change in firing rate. Although we corrected responses using this immediate pre‐omission baseline, we also examined pre‐sequence spontaneous firing rates and observed no correlation between those rates and omission responses (see S8 Fig). This methodology is consistent with established work [32], which demonstrated robust omission responses using a similar immediate reference period. To examine the presence of distinct groups based on the strength of the correlation between each neuron’s omission response and predictability of OP tone, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients. Thus, neurons encoding predictability exhibited either strong positive or strong negative correlations. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method, which identifies the “knee point” in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The knee point suggests the optimal number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model’s fit to the data (see S1 Fig). The k-means clustering analysis was performed using the k-means function in MATLAB with 10 replicates for each cluster number. The WCSS was calculated for each cluster number, and the optimal number of clusters was determined by finding the knee point in the WCSS plot. The clustering results were then visualized using histograms to display the distribution of correlation coefficients within each cluster. To mitigate potential biases such as double dipping—where the same data are used both to select and evaluate effects—and to ensure the robustness of our probability encoding analysis, we employed a split‐half approach. For each probability condition, the 50 omission trials were divided into two equal halves—an odd‐indexed “training set” and an even‐indexed “testing set,” with each set providing 25 omission trials per condition. Using only the training set, we computed Spearman’s rank correlation between each neuron’s omission response and the probability condition. Neurons with a significant correlation (p < 0.05) were provisionally labeled as “correlated,” and the OP tone for each neuron was defined based on the direction of the correlation in the training data. From this subset of correlated neurons, we then pooled the training‐set trials in the conditions where the OP was standard (75%–95%) and applied a one‐sample Wilcoxon sign‐rank test (p < 0.05) to determine whether their omission response was significantly above zero. Because the omission response is computed as the firing rate minus a local baseline, testing against zero effectively assesses whether post-omission activity exceeds the neuron’s immediate pre-omission baseline. Only neurons that exhibited both a significant correlation and a robust omission response were designated as PEONs in the training set. All subsequent population plots—such as boxplots or group correlations—were generated solely from the testing set, ensuring that any observed trends were unbiased by the training‐set selection process. Complementary analyses were also carried out using even‐indexed trials for training (with odd‐indexed trials for testing) as well as a non‐split method utilizing all trials; these additional analyses, presented in the in S2–S5 Figs, confirm that our main conclusions do not depend on the specific trial split. To ensure that neuronal responses across different tone probability conditions were not biased by differences in statistical power due to varying trial counts, we implemented a standardized subsampling procedure. For each neuron, within each condition, we limited the analysis of tones to 50 trials per stimulus type to prevent conditions with more trials from exerting disproportionate influence. If more than 50 trials were available, we selected every k-th trial, where k was chosen to achieve 50 trials (e.g., for 100 trials, k = 2; for 200 trials, k = 4, etc.). This ensured that all conditions were analyzed with equal statistical power. For analyses comparing tone responses with the split-half approach used for PEON identification and characterization (see “PEON Identification” section), an additional subsampling step was performed. After the initial reduction to 50 trials per condition, the remaining trials were further divided into ODD and EVEN subsets, with each subset matched to the corresponding half used for omission responses. For each PEON and each repetition, omission responses were extracted from the four conditions in which the OP tone was presented as the standard (i.e., 75%, 85%, 90%, and 95% OP tone). The omission responses were binned based on their sequence position, and for each bin the mean firing rate and standard error were computed, yielding a two-dimensional response matrix that captures the temporal evolution of omission responses. The mean omission response was then modeled with a logistic growth function using MATLAB’s nlinfit function. The model was defined as: FR(n) = a/[1 + exp(–b × (n – c))], where n represents the bin center corresponding to the sequence position, and a, b, and c are free parameters estimated from the data. The goodness-of-fit was assessed by calculating the R-squared value based on the residual and total sums of squares. To control for non-specific drift in neural activity, responses to standard tones during the first 50 trials were similarly analyzed. These responses were fitted with an exponential decay function of the form: FR(n) = d + e × exp(–f × n), where n denotes the trial number, and d, e, and f are free parameters. The fit quality was evaluated using the R-squared metric. To determine the laminar distribution of neurons, we adapted the methodology from Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. We used CSD analysis on local field potentials recorded with Neuropixels electrodes to identify cortical layer boundaries. The earliest clear current sink, typically corresponding to the border between layers 3 and 4, was used as a key marker. Individual neuron depths were estimated based on their distance from the probe tip, as determined by spike sorting. Neurons were then classified into supragranular (Layers 1–3), granular (Layer 4), and infragranular (Layers 5–6) layers. Cortical thickness and layer boundaries were set according to Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. To assess the relationship between tone-evoked selectivity and omission selectivity, we computed selectivity indexes – TSI and OSI for each neuron. TSI was calculated as: and represent the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to the and tones, respectively, averaged across the seven probability conditions in which each tone was presented. OSI was calculated as: and denote the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to omissions occurring in the 4 sequences where the and tones were standard, respectively. To test whether a neuron’s tone selectivity predicted its omission selectivity, we computed Spearman’s correlation between TSI and OSI. We constructed a circuit of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons following with membrane time constant and membrane resistance . When , neurons emitted a spike () and were reset to for a refractory period of 2 ms. Synaptic currents and were modeled with instantaneous rise and exponential decay, and equivalently for , with time constants and . Spikes from presynaptic neurons were delivered with a synapse-specific delay and weight as detailed in S1 Table within each stream module. Lateral connections between streams and delivered spikes with delay and weight . Sensory stimulation was presented through the input neuron I by setting its to a constant (target stream) or (adjacent streams) for 20 ms. Similarly, prediction signals were fed to the P neuron by setting with identical timing. P_strength was initialized to 0 and updated by spikes in prediction neurons as follows: and clipped to ensure at all times. Both and were raised to their respective values for 20 ms at the start of each trial, then reset to for the remaining 130 ms. The model was written in Brian2 [65], which allowed calculating exact solutions for the internal neurons of the circuit (PE+, PE–, I+, I–). The remaining neurons (P and I), synapses and P_strength were integrated with a time step of 0.1 ms by forward Euler integration. Simulations were run over 500 trials. To model sensory adaptation, we adjusted the input by using an adaptation factor a, which is greater than zero, and a base firing factor b, which is between 0 and 1. The input strength for the A and B streams under different values of Prob(A) was adjusted as follows: Examples of S_strengthA versus Prob(A) are shown in S6 Fig, with 12 combinations of a (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and b (0.1, 0.3, 0.5). (A) The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for classifying neurons based on the correlation between omission response and OP tone probability. The x-axis represents the number of clusters, while the y-axis represents the WCSS, which measures clustering compactness. A sharp inflection point, or “elbow,” is observed at k = 2, indicating that a two-cluster solution best balances model complexity and explained variance.

Full Content:
Neonatal sepsis (NNS) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO’s recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX’s full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya’s goal of Universal Health Coverage.

Neonatal sepsis (NNS) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality during the first month of life [1]. One of the primary contributors to NNS is the development of omphalitis, which is the infection of the umbilical stump [2]. This infection often arises as a result of improper and/or inadequate umbilical cord care practices, which can ultimately lead to neonatal mortality in up to 15% of cases [1]. While this is relatively uncommon in developed nations, it is a significant contributor to neonatal mortality in developing nations [1], such as Kenya. Due to this burden of NNS secondary to omphalitis, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided context-specific recommendations for newborns in settings where: (1) harmful traditional substances are prevalent and (2) the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) exceeds 30 in 1000 live births [3]. This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis of individual patient data, involving 177 neonates from five trials with a total of 129,391 newborns [3]. CHX for cord care has been shown to reduce NMR by up to 23% and prevents infection by 38–68% [4]. Furthermore, observational studies from low-income countries suggest that replacing harmful traditional cord care practices with antiseptics could save many newborn lives use [5,6]. However, this recommendation remains tentative due to the lack of data on sepsis and an inadequately described search strategy in the systemic review cited [5,6]. Moreover, the exclusion of observational studies from low-income settings (due to the absence of randomized controlled trials) limits its relevance for LMICs. The recommendation of dry cord care for LMICs that otherwise meet the criteria is therefore questionable, especially since the Cochrane review itself found no significant difference in infection rates between placebo and antiseptic use [5,7]. Kenya has a 29.3% prevalence of NNS [8], and the incidence rate of omphalitis is estimated at between 20–77 of every 1000 live births of newborns delivered within healthcare facilities [9]. The incidence rate of omphalitis is purported to be higher in at-home births [9]. The NMR has been documented 21 deaths per 1,000 live births, accounting for 66% of infant deaths and 51% of under-5 deaths [10]. However, this NMR varies widely between the counties of Kenya. A 2018 study conducted in Machakos County revealed that, of all the admissions in the newborn unit, 34% constituted cases of NNS and were associated with 15% of the deaths reported [9]. WHO’s recommendation for the contextual use of CHX for cord care is a transition from the previous recommendation of the use of surgical spirit [11], a recommendation which was also reflected in Kenya’s 2009 National Guidelines for Quality Perinatal Care [12]. Surgical spirit is no longer recommended for umbilical cord care due to its limited efficacy in preventing infections, potential to irritate newborn skin, and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives like CHX [11,13–15]. In 2016, however, the Government of Kenya recommended the use of CHX in all births to ensure equal standards in healthcare provision for all citizens of the country [16], therefore adopting the new WHO guidelines nation-wide [17]. Since Kenya’s adoption of the WHO recommendation on the use of CHX in all neonates in 2016, the implementation has been set to take three phases: (1) preparation, (2) planning, and (3) execution. Expounded, this process includes the alignment of policy, developing guidelines, introducing the product, training of service providers, generating demand for the product, and finally, monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A 2016 study by Muriuki et al. found that HCWs in rural Kenya widely accepted the use of CHX for umbilical cord care, citing benefits such as faster healing, reduced infections, ease of use, and positive community feedback [18]. For successful scale-up, they emphasized the need for community sensitization, proper training, consistent supply, clear guidelines, and inclusive service delivery approaches [18]. However, a 2021 cross-sectional study at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital found that while most mothers received some education on CHX use, both mothers and HCWs demonstrated poor understanding of its proper application [9]. Different counties are expected to have achieved different levels of adoption given that healthcare in Kenya is devolved to the county level with the national level providing policy guidance. Given that Kenya has a goal to further increase the uptake of CHX treatment to above 80% in all health care facilities by 2026 [4], the adoption of CHX for cord care has yet to undergo M&E through the perspectives of HCWs. The CHX uptake in Kiambu county is 40.1% [18], and therefore, understanding HCW experiences with cord care practices in the county would be essential to shape health policy and highlighting gaps in its implementation. The study adopted an exploratory qualitative design using key informant interviews (KIIs) guided by semi-structured question guides, and which were conducted between 6th October 2022–9th November 2022. The data was collected from six health facilities in Kiambu County. This study was carried out in Kiambu County, Kenya, which has a population of over 2.4 million people. The location coordinates are 10 10’S 36050’E, and it neighbors six other counties, namely Nairobi City and Kajiado Counties to the South, Machakos to the East, Murang’a to the North East, Nyandarua to the North west, and Nakuru County to the West [19]. The county is 60% urban and 40% rural due to its proximity to the capital city Nairobi. The county has 505 health facilities, comprising 108 public, 64 faith-based, and 333 privately owned facilities. In Kenya’s health system, Level 1 refers to community-based services (e.g., health promotion and preventive care), Level 2 to dispensaries, Level 3 to health centers, Level 4 to sub-county hospitals, and Level 5 to county referral hospitals. Maternity services are typically offered at Level 3 (health centers) and above, including private and faith-based hospitals. Therefore, this study gathered insights from HCWs working in Level 3, 4, and 5 public facilities, as well as private hospitals. One of the Level 5 hospitals (Thika Level 5 Hospital) in this study also functions as a teaching hospital for medical and nursing students. CHX for newborn umbilical cord care is available in two formulations: gel and solution [20]. Both forms are recommended by the WHO and are included in the Kenya Essential Medicines List as well as in postnatal care guidelines [20–22]. In line with this, Kenya’s Ministry of Health (MoH) endorses the availability and use of both CHX formulations [20]. The choice between the dosage formulations used depends on what is acceptable to mothers, caregivers, HCWs and availability [23]. According to the national guidelines, immediately post-delivery, a HCW should apply CHX to the newborn’s umbilical cord using sterile gloves. The antiseptic is applied to the base, stump, and tip of the cord [20]. For gel formulations, the HCW uses their index finger to spread it; for the solution, the dropper is used to apply CHX directly. The CHX is not cleaned off after application. In the postnatal period, CHX should be applied once daily until the seventh day or until the cord naturally detaches: whichever happens first. Mothers and/or caregivers are instructed on how to apply CHX at home following the same procedures, but in lieu of sterile gloves, they are advised to thoroughly wash their hands before each application. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), now defunct, but which was active during the period of the study, had a program called Linda Mama that covered the costs of antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) for all pregnant women [24]. However, it notably excluded the cost of CHX, and currently, there is no government-sponsored program providing CHX free of charge to mothers during the postnatal period. The study population consisted of over 2,600 HCWs providing health services in Kiambu County during the study period. No formal sample size was calculated and we applied the information saturation principle [25]. Two providers were targeted in every unit (with a target of 30 HCWs) during the study’s formulation, however some units were understaffed during the study and hence only had one HCW interviewed. The cadre and respective facility of the sample are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326506.t001 Inclusion criteria - HCWs who had direct interactions with neonates or were involved in providing or handling CHX cord antiseptic during the study period, and who had at least 6 months of experience with cord care. Exclusion criteria - HCWs who were not directly involved in newborn care or who declined to provide informed consent and who had less than 6 months of experience with cord care. A total of 38 KIIs were conducted between 6th October 2022 and 9th November 2022. All interviews were conducted by two members of the study team, JMG and BNO, both holding Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degrees. JMG serves as the Kiambu county pharmacist and holds a PhD in pharmacy, while BNO is a researcher with experience in qualitative data analysis. Both researchers received training prior to data collection to ensure consistency and quality. The interviews were conducted in English, but participants were allowed to respond in either English or Kiswahili. BNO, who is bilingual and fluent in both written and spoken English and Standard Kiswahili, translated the KIIs, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim directly from Kiswahili into English when applicable. Each participant was assigned a unique index number (1–38), and quotations are referenced using the format: HospitalName_Cadre_IndexNumber. Kobo Toolbox software was used to collect and manage data, with all data coded to conceal the participants’ identities. To ensure data security, electronic data collected via KoboCollect were encrypted and password-protected on the devices. After transfer, data files were securely stored on password-protected computers and backed up on a secure cloud platform with restricted access. NVivo project files were similarly protected to maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the analysis process. Interview transcripts were imported into NVivo software to assist in the classification, sorting, and coding of data into central themes and subthemes. The coding process followed a two-cycle approach. In the first cycle, value coding was used to capture participants’ attitudes and values, reflecting their perceptions and experiences. The second cycle involved focused and pattern coding. Focused coding developed specific categories without focusing on their properties, while pattern coding grouped similar codes into meaningful units for theme identification [26–28]. NVivo’s platform played a crucial role in facilitating this multi-level coding process, ensuring consistency in the analysis framework by identifying recurring patterns and connections. The research questions and interview guide informed the coding frame, allowing for accurate classification of notable data segments to reveal dominant themes. The integration of value, focused, and pattern coding in both cycles ensured a comprehensive and structured analysis of the interview data [26–28].BNO, JMG, and PKJ also independently reviewed the transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data and identify initial codes. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion to ensure consistency and reliability. Upon arrival at the various study sites, verbal consent was initially sought from the manager of each facility unit, followed by written consent from the hospital medical superintendent. Prior to the initiation of data collection, participants were informed about the study’s objectives and their role as respondents. They were assured that participation was entirely voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw at any time. All data collected by the researchers were treated as confidential and utilized exclusively for this study. Access to the materials was restricted to the investigators, and stringent data management protocols were implemented to uphold the confidentiality of the study subjects. Approval was obtained at various administrative levels, including county and sub-county authorities before the study commenced. Ethical clearance was secured from the University of Nairobi/Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Review Committee [P470/05/2022], County Government of Kiambu Department of Health Services, Kiambu County [KIAMBU/HRDU/22/09/14/RA_GITHINJI], and a research license was obtained from the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation [NACOSTI/P/22/20446]. A total of 38 HCWs were interviewed, as depicted in Table 1. The mean age of respondents was 35.6 years (Range: 23–57 years). The HCWs interviewed had a mean of 9.4 years of professional experience, with a median of 7.5 years, a mode of 7 years, and a range spanning from 0.5 to 30 years. In terms of time spent at their current stations, the average was 4.4 years, with a median of 3 years, a mode of 1 year, and a range from the minimum of 0.5 years to 22 years. Participants had an average practice duration of 9 years. The transcripts drawn from recordings of KIIs held with selected HCWs were analyzed, and themes emerged as 33 files with 52 references. Some themes mirrored the guiding questions in the semi-structured questionnaire, as shown in the coding tree as Fig 1. The numbers in brackets indicates the total number of individual references that mention that specific code within the files.

National policy recommendation We sought to understand the general cord care practices in various health facilities across Kiambu County by interviewing HCWs. According to MoH guidelines, the use of CHX for cord care has been officially recommended, with the directive being disseminated from the central government to the county level. This was confirmed by a participant from Nazareth Hospital, who stated, “first of all, we have the policy that is an order that came from Kiambu County from the Ministry of Health that chlorhexidine should be used” (Nazareth_Pharmacist_25). The majority of participants acknowledged the existence of the MoH guidelines recommending CHX for cord care, confirmed that this policy had been communicated to health facilities and gave a description of the same policy in their responses. “So after birth, when you cut the cord, immediately we use the chlorhexidine, and after, we use it once a day, once a day after delivery until now the mothers goes home and you instruct them to use it until the cord dries off and falls off.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “…the next thing is to maintain hygiene of the cord, and this is done by applying an antiseptic. Commonly we use chlorhexidine, either the gel or the solution.” (Kiambu_ Paediatrician_36) “...The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX]...” (Thika_Midwife_13) 2. Facility-level departures from national recommendations HCWs mentioned that surgical spirit remained the predominant choice in practice, indicating a reluctance to fully transition from previous guidelines. In fact, almost half (41.7%) of participants reported having prior experience with surgical spirit before being required to switch to CHX, which was a new product in their facilities. Some facilities reported not using CHX at all, relying solely on surgical spirit for cord care. This variation in practice highlights the need for further investigation into the slow adoption of CHX in these settings, despite the existence of formal guidelines. Furthermore, despite clear directives, Thika Level 5 Hospital actively deviated from the National Guidelines, opting instead to follow its own facility-based protocol of dry cord care. “Here in our health facility... We discussed with our pediatrician and we just decided to leave the cord just like that. Don’t put anything, don’t put water, don’t put the spirit, and don’t put chlorhexidine, as long as you keep it clean. And we have not had any case of sepsis... The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX].” But then we are agreed for us, we don’t use it here, we have not been using it, and we have not had any cases of neonatal sepsis.” (Thika_Midwife_13) “So the current cord care practice in Thika Level 5 I would say, predominantly because that’s where I practice is dry cord care. I hardly do surgical spirit or chlorhexidine or any other medication directly with the cord.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_12) “And what I’ve noted, there is less uptake of chlorhexidine use for cord care compared to the surgical spirit.... the pediatrician and also other practitioners [are] persistent on the use of surgical spirit as opposed to chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “So currently, in Kiambu County, there are different things that are being done … some places and institutions that are using chlorhexidine for cord care. Then a number of institutions are using surgical spirit. There are some people who even believe on doing nothing to cord care. There are people who are using normal saline for cord care.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_37) “…I just know most of the time, they don’t even use that chlorhexidine. They use surgical spirit.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_18) 3. Mothers’ use of blended and traditional cord care methods A minor theme emerged in which some HCWs reported that mothers used multiple cord care methods, often influenced by either their past experiences or family advice, or both. For example, if surgical spirit had been ineffective with their first baby, they would switch to CHX for subsequent children, and vice versa. In some cases, mothers who delivered during the era of previous guidelines recommending surgical spirit continued to favour it. Other practices included the use of saliva, a traditional method still common in our context. “There is the use of … saliva, especially for the traditional mothers” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) “One challenge is that mothers out there, they have other methods of doing cord care. When you teach them how to do it, they go at home and they’re taught by other relatives how to do it … Like they will buy spirit because the other baby they used spirit, or they will use another thing like savlon that’s hindering proper use of the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “some mothers are resistant to change, especially those who delivered much earlier and chlorhexidine was not there before. So if they used spirit, they still want to use spirit … or even using saliva or cow dung.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “The common challenge that we face is that mothers believe in the use of some traditional methods like use of saliva.” (Ruiru_Midwife_6) The preferences that HCWs had for CHX in cord care were varied, largely shaped by their clinical and anecdotal experiences with different methods. Approximately half of the HCWs who expressed satisfaction with CHX did so primarily due to its perceived effectiveness in preventing omphalitis and NNS. This ultimately reduced the need for additional healthcare visits for both mothers and newborns. Many HCWs in favor of CHX also highlighted that it promoted quicker stump healing compared to other methods, provided that mothers followed proper instructions, maintained good hygiene, and began cord care immediately or shortly after birth. Additionally, CHX was praised for being easy to use, contributing to its widespread adoption and positive outcomes. “So far, the outcomes have been good. We have had limited cases of sepsis after the use of chlorhexidine.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “… those who practice, okay, cord care with chlorhexidine as they are instructed, the outcome is good.” (Kihara_Midwife_16) “The use of chlorhexidine for cord care has made work easier in Kiambu since it’s easy to use and its availability, its efficacy being high has made it easier for us to manage the newborns and their mothers are even happy with the healing process using chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) “The effectiveness of cord care is better compared with [traditional or surgical spirit] methods … in comparison with the mothers that have been using the surgical spirit and the cord care, during the postnatal checkup one week post-delivery, the mothers who have been using the chlorhexidine, the cords are healed faster compared with other methods.” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) 1. Systemic barriers One of the most significant barriers to the adoption and provision of CHX for cord care was its inconsistent availability in government health facilities. This challenge of access was twofold: not only was there a shortage of government-supplied CHX to health facilities, and when it was available, its cost often priced consumers out of the market. Many mothers at the facility found the cost of CHX prohibitive. As a result, HCWs recommended more affordable alternatives, which hindered CHX’s widespread adoption and led mothers to choose cheaper options like surgical spirit. “…And then the erratic supplies for the county, particularly because of those financial constraints the counties have been having have made it easy for us to try out other things because in the absence of chlorhexidine, what else was being done to allow cords to heal... the supplies and the county, it’s quite irregular. The stock-outs are very, very, very common because of the budgetary constraints in the county.” (Thika_ Paediatrician _12) “The first challenge is limited resources from the county. That is, when receiving our delivery from KEMSA, we might also be able to receive chlorhexidine. Another challenge is from the patients. Once the drug is prescribed, some patients may not be able to purchase from the pharmacies outside.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_24) “The challenges of provision of chlorhexidine gel, first of all, I’d say it’s not readily available. As in, even if I sent a mother outside here to buy, I don’t think it’s as available as there rest. Secondly, the cost. It’s a challenge because the mothers are not able to afford it” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) 2. Perceived product-specific disadvantages Some HCWs associated CHX use with delayed cord healing, sepsis, and prolonged cord detachment. In a few instances, they reported that neonates had returned to the hospital with infections after its use. Concerns also emerged over the varying CHX formulations, which caused confusion, particularly due to its resemblance to tetracycline eye ointment and challenges in proper application. The drop formulation was especially scrutinized, with some HCWs believing it contributed to sepsis and soft tissue burns. Their perceptions of CHX's effectiveness were largely shaped by mothers’ feedback. These second-hand accounts reinforced the belief that CHX was less effective than other cord care methods, ultimately influencing its use within health facilities. “…The [CHX] drops, the mothers are coming back with septic cords. I don’t know whether it’s the hygiene at home or what. I don’t get. But when we get a mother that comes and then we take the history, they say they bought the drops. But with the gel, no, not much sepsis. But with the drops, there is.” (Kiambu_Midwife_35) “Now, the problem with the gel was that either it was too thick and it kept leaving the cord moist, and so it would take longer for the cord to drop off … So, a lot of children would come with delayed cord dropping.” (Thika_Paediatrician_12) “Initially, we used to use the chlorhexidine gel, which was a bit difficult to use because it required one to wash their hands or change their gloves, apply the gel on their finger, and then spread the gel on the cord and surrounding skin. The gel could also be confused with tetracycline eye ointment because of the kind of packaging it came in. However, with the solution, it's much easier to use because all one needs to do is to drop a few drops on the umbilical cord and leave the baby's cord to dry. The packaging is also very different from the tetracycline eye ointment, so confusion is reduced.” (Kiambu_Paediatrician_36) 3. Inconsistent use instructions The data corpus revealed a significant knowledge gap among HCWs and mothers regarding the use of CHX for cord care, with some indicating that it should be applied once a day but others recommending it twice a day. HCWs often demonstrated preferences for alternative practices, reflecting a reluctance towards the adoption of CHX. These gaps were primarily due to insufficient HCW training on CHX application, leading to a lack of awareness among mothers about proper usage. “… the mothers need an education. There are mothers who will not want to use chlorhexidine gel because of mythical thoughts or superstition, or that’s not what they were taught by their mothers to use. So, sensitization is needed … we need to sensitize the healthcare workers because sometimes we have found mothers who have not used chlorhexidine gel because the physician who was working with the mother did not believe in the working of chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) 4. Inertia Among HCWs, the knowledge gap regarding CHX use is further complicated by resistance to switch from surgical spirit, which many have successfully used in the past. This resistance is often rooted in personal experiences with both products. HCWs tend to favor surgical spirit, largely due to their familiarity with it and the perceived shortcomings of CHX. “I think the fact that most of the healthcare workers were used to surgical spirit, the switch to chlorhexidine and the fact that it takes time, the cord takes time to heal, I think most people are still reluctant to start mothers on the gel. They’ll prefer surgical spirit.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) HCWs underscored the need for increased awareness and education among both HCWs and patients, citing persistent knowledge gaps regarding CHX’s benefits and proper usage. Many recommended improving accessibility by including CHX in maternity packages or ensuring its consistent availability in hospital pharmacies, thereby enabling timely application immediately after delivery, which is a critical factor for its efficacy. Affordability also emerged as a central concern, with suggestions to reduce the cost of CHX and incorporate it into health insurance schemes such as (formerly) Linda Mama to alleviate the financial burden on mothers. Furthermore, HCWs advocated for comprehensive training programs targeting midwives, doctors, and pediatricians to deepen their understanding of CHX. Such training would enable healthcare providers to more effectively counsel patients, thereby promoting greater uptake of CHX in cord care practices. “Yes. So number one, it’s the cost. It is readily available to them considering that it is covered by NHIF, number one...” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “Suggest that the hospital should source for more of the drug to ensure that it’s constantly available for use to increase its uptake. Interviewer: If it was available, do you think everybody would use. Interviewee: Yeah.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “I think we need proper training for the staff, especially in maternity, even for us working in the postnatal clinics, because I understand the gel should be started immediately after birth.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) “The other one is educating, first of all, the healthcare worker on how to use it so that the healthcare worker is empowered to also educate the mothers on how to use it.” (Thika_Pharmacist_11) IEC materials depicting the application of CHX were found to be largely unavailable and inadequate in healthcare facilities. A significant majority of respondents (86.1%) reported that these materials were inaccessible in most hospital units, resulting in ineffective promotion of CHX utilization. In cases where materials did exist, they were often not suitable for illiterate women, who frequently resorted to traditional methods of cord care. To address this gap, HCWs suggested developing more inclusive IEC materials, such as pictorials and patient-friendly infographics, to ensure that all mothers could benefit from the health education provided. These materials included charts, pictograms, and illustrations that use inclusive language. using accessible language. These patient-friendly IEC materials should be strategically placed in locations such as antenatal clinics and labor wards, so that mothers are informed about the importance of CHX and can prepare to obtain it before delivery. HCWs also recommended tailoring resources specifically for their needs, including physical charts as reminders at workstations, along with Continuous Medical Education (CME) sessions and training programs. Observations made by the participants included the following: “But in the facility in Githunguri, I’ve not seen any [IECs]. And I think CME is about the chlorhexidine would really help in creating awareness… everywhere, in every ward, in the postnatal rooms, and in labor ward, and also here in antenatal.” (Githunguri_PNC-nurse_29) “On the issue of IEC materials, they’re not available in our facility. If they can be effective and brought down to the facilities, I would recommend they be more pictorial. By a glance, someone is able to know what it is and how it can be used and the readings big enough to be legible.” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) “The IEC material would help the staff here be at least more conversant for those who are not conversant with chlorhexidine gel, its use, its application, the period which the patient is supposed to use... Through the information the staff acquire, they’ll be able to make more informed decisions of even escalating the matter to facilitate the increase of the supply of the chlorhexidine gel in the facility and also acts a refresher …as opposed to other previous methods that were used of cord care…The IECs are not available at the facility at the moment...” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “For the charts, they should be bigger, and they should provide more charts so that we can put maybe in the wards and to educate the mothers. And for those mothers who are illiterate who cannot read, the wordings are many than the pictures. The pictures are better illustrating of how to use the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) This study explored the experiences of HCWs in Kiambu County regarding newborn cord care and revealed significant deviations from Kenya’s national guidelines which recommends the blanket use of CHX for all neonates nationwide. Despite the increasing adoption of CHX, with 41.7% of HCWs reported transitioning from surgical spirit, outdated and potentially harmful practices such as the use of surgical or methylated spirit persisted in our set-up. One facility in our study, Thika Level 5 Hospital, adopted its own facility-based practice of dry cord care. Our findings suggests that the national policy on CHX has not been fully implemented or embraced in practice, underscoring the need for strengthened policy adherence and education. The participants in this study reported diverse experiences with the use of CHX for cord care. Key concerns included the cost of CHX products, delayed healing, and varying perceptions of its effectiveness. The cost of CHX, which was quoted between Ksh. 120–200 (USD 0.93 to 1.55), was perceived as expensive by some clients, particularly when compared to more affordable alternatives such as methylated spirit (Ksh. 50, USD 0.34) or dry cord care, which incurs no cost. This contrasts with the findings of Opanga et al., who reported that CHX gel was available at less than Ksh 40 in private facilities and pharmacies, and was free in public hospitals, yet with only a minimal uptake of 1.3% [29]. Another study conducted in rural Bungoma county found that CHX was provided free of charge to mothers after delivery, but noted that improper use and misunderstandings regarding its application negatively impacted uptake, along with echoing concerns about delayed cord separation [30]. The variations in participants’ experiences with CHX use in Kiambu County may reflect the unique socio-economic and health system dynamics of a peri-urban area situated near the capital city. While Kiambu’s proximity to Nairobi may suggest better access to health information and services, it also presents a complex interplay between urban and rural health-seeking behaviours. Unlike rural Bungoma, where CHX was provided free and uptake issues were mainly due to poor understanding or instructions, Kiambu residents may encounter CHX more frequently through private pharmacies or clinics where it is sold at significantly higher prices, making it prohibitive to lower-income households despite theoretical availability. Furthermore, price discrepancies between public and private sectors may indicate a lack of standardized pricing or public awareness about where to obtain CHX for free. This is supported by the findings of Opanga et al., which noted low uptake despite free availability in public hospitals [29]. This demonstrates a disconnect between policy and implementation, possibly fueled by inadequate dissemination of information, lack of health worker engagement, or supply chain challenges in public facilities. Despite these challenges, our results also highlighted positive feedback from HCWs, particularly around the ease of use, prevention of sepsis, and faster cord separation, suggests potential benefits. This echoes a participant in Opanga et al.‘s study who reported early cord separation, with the cord drying and detaching after just three days, highlighting the promise of CHX in improving neonatal outcomes when used appropriately [29]. The majority of HCWs interviewed indicated challenges in the provision of CHX due to systemic challenges of unavailability. The inclusion of CHX in the Kenya Essential Medicines List was intended to enhance its availability in the public sector, and this highlights a gap in enforcement of this directive in our context [22]. The overarching goal of healthcare systems is to ensure that all patients have consistent access to a comprehensive range of suitable, high-quality, and affordable essential medicines, as emphasized by the WHO [31]. Essential medicines are critical components of healthcare, recognized alongside clean water, safe food supply, and adequate housing as fundamental necessities; their absence constitutes a failure to uphold universal human rights [32,31]. However, essential medicines frequently experience stock-outs in developing countries [32,31]. In Kenya, where health services are devolved (the national government “shares” government functions with smaller county governments), the impact of these stock-outs varies across the different counties. To mitigate the occurrence of stock-outs for essential medications on the package list, it is crucial for public sector facilities to ensure timely payments to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) for their orders [33,34]. Conversely, non-public facilities report infrequent stock-outs due to differing and strengthened procurement processes. Stock-outs were also identified as a significant concern by Ambale et al. at Kangundo Hospital [16]. Consequently, participants reported a lack of sustained experience with the products, which undermined their confidence in persuading mothers to purchase them upon leaving the healthcare facilities. Furthermore, to achieve optimal coverage, particularly for economically disadvantaged families, subsidization may be necessary [35]. The aforementioned issue raises a critical discussion about the disconnect between policy and implementation under Kenya’s devolved health system. It highlights that simply listing a drug as essential is not enough without effective supply chain management, accountability structures, and financing mechanisms at the county level. The situation in Kiambu highlights how inconsistent availability of essential medicines like CHX undermines provider confidence, policy adherence, and public trust, all of which contribute to missed opportunities for preventing neonatal infections and deaths. Moreover, the inequity between public and non-public facilities, where the latter have more consistent procurement systems, underscores the urgency of reforming public sector logistics and financing flows: particularly timely disbursement of funds to suppliers. Without these structural changes, the promise of universal health coverage and improved neonatal outcomes will remain unrealized. This discussion also sets the stage for recommending policy enforcement mechanisms, decentralized budgeting reforms, and stronger accountability for county health departments, as essential steps toward resolving persistent stock-outs of life-saving commodities. HCWs reported inadequate training in CHX cord care, leading to significant knowledge gaps and unfamiliarity with recommended guidelines. This resulted in variations in the reported frequency of CHX application. This finding aligns with another Kenyan study, which linked the lack of training and clear instructions to the ineffectiveness of CHX gel [16]. To address research-driven shifts, standardized guidelines for CHX use are essential. Ongoing medical education for all cord care personnel is crucial. Participants also emphasized the need for increased media publicity to enhance consumer knowledge, in line with the sensitization efforts recommended by Opanga et al. [29]. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 89.2% of births in Kiambu County occurred in hospitals, with 98% of these deliveries attended by medical professionals [36]. This rate is notably higher than the 54% and 64% reported in Pemba (Tanzania) and Zambia, respectively [37,38]. However, having a medically assisted delivery does not necessarily guarantee a reduced risk of infection, as many medical centers in our context fail to meet minimal infection prevention standards [39]. Furthermore, potentially hazardous procedures that raise concerns in home delivery settings are often performed on women and infants before they are discharged within hours of birth [15]. While Kiambu’s high institutional delivery rate might suggest optimal conditions for newborn cord care, this can create a false sense of security if not paired with stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. It challenges the assumption that health facility births inherently reduce neonatal infections and points to the critical role of CHX as a safeguard, even within supposedly safer environments. This further reinforces the WHO’s position on universal CHX application, emphasizing that the presence of a skilled birth attendant does not automatically equate to safe neonatal outcomes: especially in under-resourced or overstretched facilities. Integrating CHX as a routine part of postnatal care, regardless of delivery setting, can act as a simple, cost-effective buffer against systemic IPC failures, especially in high-volume facilities that discharge mothers and newborns within hours of delivery. Most HCWs in our study suggested several strategies to enhance the uptake of CHX. IEC is crucial for ensuring correct usage, infection control, patient safety, and adherence to best practices. Participants emphasized the importance of recommending CHX to mothers and providing education on its proper use. These sentiments are echoed in the existing literature as this resistance to CHX has been previously described in similar settings [13,30,40–42]. Both the quantity and quality of IEC materials on CHX need improvement. Visual aids and illustrations should be prioritized over text to enhance mothers’ understanding of proper CHX use. Our study found that, while most health facilities had some IEC materials on CHX, these resources were limited and lacked engaging illustrations to support learning. This finding aligns with those of the Bungoma County study [30], and further highlights a pressing need to improve these materials for HCWs. While participants rightly identified the aforementioned methods as key to increasing CHX uptake, these strategies cannot succeed without a robust and context-sensitive health communication framework. The limited, often text-heavy IEC materials reported in this study reveal a missed opportunity to engage mothers, many of whom may have low health literacy or limited formal education, in ways that resonate with their daily realities. This challenge calls for a shift from generic IEC content to co-designed, visual, and language-appropriate tools that accommodate all literacy levels. Devolution in Kenya offers both a challenge and an opportunity: counties like Kiambu can tailor CHX strategies to their unique population needs, but this must be done in alignment with national guidelines and messaging, to ensure consistency and avoid confusion. This requires capacity-building for local health workers, investment in community engagement strategies, and partnerships with trusted media outlets to amplify accurate, culturally resonant messages on CHX use. Ultimately, the effectiveness of CHX as a public health intervention depends not just on availability, but on how well it is communicated, understood, and trusted at the community level. The mixed perceptions, inconsistent use of CHX for cord care and the use of alternative cord care methods in Kiambu County reveal a deeper systemic issue that extends beyond individual preferences: it points to critical gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health communication. The fact that one of the facilities included in our study practice cord care contrary to national guidelines is particularly concerning and highlights a lack of oversight and accountability in guideline implementation. To ensure CHX fulfills its potential as a low-cost, high-impact intervention for preventing neonatal infections, there is an urgent need for policy action at both county and national levels. This includes: (1) strengthening the enforcement of national neonatal care protocols across all facilities, (2) ensuring uninterrupted availability of CHX through timely procurement and subsidization, and (3) developing and disseminating culturally appropriate, visually driven IEC materials to improve community understanding and uptake. As Kenya advances toward Universal Health Coverage, it is imperative that essential medicines like CHX are not only listed on paper but made reliably available and appropriately used at the point of care. A unified, well-supported CHX strategy will not only align with WHO recommendations but also directly contribute to reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality: especially among the most vulnerable populations. This must begin with aligning policy intent with health system practice.

For starters, the real AI magic isn’t in chatbots like ChatGPT. That’s surface-level stuff. It’s in applications, like the FedEx (FDX) Surround system, which uses AI to monitor and shift, if necessary, time-sensitive shipments.

STK also holds Visa (V) and fuel-cell-maker Bloom Energy (BE). Let’s call those “tech-adjacent.” STK sells call options on part of its portfolio, which generates extra income to support its 6.3% dividend.

Moreover, portfolio manager Paul Wick has 38 years of experience and it shows: In the last five years STK’s total return has outpaced the NASDAQ, which we all know has been on a tear: STK Total Returns One thing to remember is that STK is on investors’ radar, so it trades at a premium to NAV. But that premium is well below the peaks it’s hit in recent years, making STK something of a bargain in disguise. That premium could turn some folks who don’t know STK’s history away, providing an opportunity to step in. The Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX), as the name says, holds NASDAQ stocks. But unlike index funds, it pays a big dividend: 8.5%. Like STK, QQQX fuels its payout, in part, through option sales. QQQX’s portfolio of NASDAQ stocks includes the tech kingpins, plus firms like travel site operator Booking Holdings (BKG) that also benefit from “growth without hiring.” The fund’s 5.7% discount gives us another tailwind as it narrows and (likely, in my view) flips to a premium—something it’s long overdue for: QQQX Discount NAV Now let’s add more “tech-adjacent” holdings with … The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV) rounds out our trio with a focus on innovators from across the economy—particularly finance stocks—set to cash in as they integrate AI into their businesses.

GDV yields 6.5% and is the steadiest payer of the bunch, with a payout that hasn’t been cut since the 2009 financial crisis. The fund’s discount has been stuck in double digits in recent years, but it has been narrowing lately. I expect that discount to keep shrinking as AI optimizes sectors like finance.

The largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can now be used as collateral on two of the most active crypto trading platforms, Crypto.com and Deribit, issuer Securitize said in a Wednesday press release. The listings allow institutional traders to post BUIDL tokens as margin for leveraged trades on those two exchanges, while also earning yield on the underlying token. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing about 400% in the past year to over $7 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show. These tokens let investors earn a yield on their idle cash, just like a money market fund, but without leaving the blockchain environment. They are also increasingly being used as collateral for trading. With $2.9 billion in assets, BUIDL is the largest of the tokenized Treasury funds and is backed by a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries. "Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry’s most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement. "The [BUIDL] fund is evolving from a yield-bearing token into a core component of crypto market infrastructure."

Title: Globalist Finance-Capital Can’t Get Enough of War. “NATO’s Quest for War”. Ret Admiral Cem Gürdeniz

While the Ukraine War continues, Israel attacked Iran on June 13, 2025, citing the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) decision against Iran, which was taken with a small margin of votes, in a conjuncture where the US declared that the Nuclear Talks with Iran in Oman would continue. On the other hand, it has been revealed that the United States, although it knew that this attack would take place and supported it, gave the wrong messages to Iran under the guise of diplomacy and created a suitable smoke screen environment for Israel to provide tactical and even strategic surprises. Thus, while the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the biggest genocide in recent history in Gaza, continues a new and bigger front has been opened in West Asia. Although the ostensibly main reason is geopolitical, economic reasons are at least as important and even its twin brother. Throughout history, finance-capital has been on the side of wars, not peace. Because they work with the goal of constantly expanding earnings. Factories, arms manufacturers, banks want access to new markets, new sources of raw materials. Lenin described this feature of finance capital as the stage of “imperialism”. Finance capital has adopted the principle of waging wars for the world, colonies, raw material resources and new markets. Thus, from the hegemons with which they have a symbiotic relationship, they direct their surplus production to underdeveloped states through both borrowing and investments, and demand military intervention when necessary. This situation is carried out in harmony with the achievement of geopolitical goals of the hegemons. As long as geopolitics and finance-capital vision work in harmony, the hegemon continues to impose its global will. .

(VOA/Screengrab) . On the other hand, the world of finance and capital uses war as a means of overcoming the economic crises it faces. While wars overshadow economic crises, they serve as a new revival for the economy. For example, the United States survived the Great Depression of 1929 with the Second World War. The military industry is also one of the leading elements of finance capital, which wants war. Because as well as being a very lucrative sector, it also makes a great contribution to employment. Therefore, it is always essential for finance capital to always create enemies by maintaining the constant threat environment and to increase defense expenditures regularly. The hegemonic order of the United States functioned in this way, especially after the end of the Second World War. The state structure under the command of finance capital of the USA, which initially used the blood of its own children in Korea and Vietnam, abolished the compulsory military service system after 1973 and the majority started to use the cheap blood of other nations and organizations through proxy wars. Human life has no value for finance capital. The important thing in the plunder of weak countries is the multiplication of profits. It is not worth it if millions die for the gain to multiply. Today, the U.S. supports constant wars to keep Eurasia fragmented, to dominate the rimland geopolitics, to weaken the international transportation corridors led by China and Russia, and to break the influence of organizations such as BRICS and the SCO, in order to maintain its hegemony jointly with finance capital. Although Trump said during the election under the MAGA Slogan, that they would abandon these goals and withdraw into themselves and strengthen their economies primarily as a production and trade power, he has surrendered today. In 2024, the total economic size of the world was 110 trillion dollars at current prices. In response to this value created by real economies, as of 2024, the total contract value of interest-rate derivatives (IRS), currency derivatives and commodity/share-based derivatives of the finance-capital world was 730 trillion dollars. The owners of this value, which is based on 40 times the tangible assets and seven times the real economy, are the global finance capital oligarchy. The vast majority of these large assets are owned and controlled by American banks, huge financial firms such as the American BlackRock, the Soros Foundation, companies such as Rothschild & Co, the Edmond de Rothschild Group, techno-feudal SpaceX, Palantir and London-based (City), etc. As in the past, giant firms and multinational corporations that control finance capital can exert great pressure on governments. War or peace is decided by this structure, not democratically elected governments. Worse still, this structure, which advocates free elections under the discourse of democracy, decides who will come to power in which country. It can influence elections with its monetary power. He can buy politicians. He can make a coup. The vast majority of this structure is made up of people of Jewish origin who have been influential in the financial world for centuries, or groups such as Zionist loyalists or neoconservatives. The hard power of this structure consists of the American, British and Israeli armed forces and intelligence agencies, which are unconditionally linked to each other at the highest level. In the second layer, the extremist NATO structure with a gradual neocon tandem under the control of NATO Secretaries General (France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, 3 Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland) and in the Indo-Pacific area, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand takes place. Political pillars include EU governing bodies, American neocons belonging to the majority democratic party and partly republicans, Zionists and evangelicals as inseparable and indispensable allies of finance capital. Although Trump and the “America First” or MAGA group drew new road maps outside of finance-capital interests to recover the US economy, which had declined in production with a debt stock of 36 trillion dollars when they came to power, they could not impose their own will. They could not stop the Ukraine-Russia war or the genocide in Gaza. On the contrary, they encouraged Israel to attack Iran in a fierce manner. They retreated in all areas. Trump has done almost the opposite of what he said in his campaign promises. This situation is similar to the fact that all three presidents (JFK, LBJ, and Nixon) who came with the promise of ending the Vietnam War had to continue the war. Finance capital plays a major role in the election of elected presidents in the United States. As long as they serve their interests, they don’t cause problems. But anything can happen when presidents take a course that goes against the interests of finance capital and, most importantly, the interests of Israel. Because finance capital has infinite dollar power in its hands. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his support, saying “Long live Israel, long live America” shortly after the June 13, 2025 Iran attack that will determine his political future. Trump also said that if Iran attacks American targets in the region, the United States will protect itself. Although US Secretary of State Rubio said that Washington was completely outside this process, it later turned out that Trump was aware of every stage. In fact, with his rhetoric of peace and negotiations, Trump has made a kind of mask for Israel’s attacks. It is known that Israel has been with Iran from the ammunition it uses to intelligence, air refueling and air/missile defense system support. In fact, it turned out that he had sent 300 Hellfire missiles to Israel weeks ago. On the other hand, Trump’s refusal to visit Israel during his visit to the Gulf countries in mid-May 2025 was considered a serious pressure message to Netanyahu. However, Trump paid the price for this move against the Zionists, who play a decisive role in American politics, with the riots that broke out in the country. Trump’s pressure on Netanyahu seems to have been lifted by the anti-ICE riots that began in Los Angeles and AIPAC’s financial influence in Congress. Trump failed to show the same resistance to Netanyahu as Obama, whom he criticized so much, in attacking Iran. It can be said that the Epstein files may have an impact as well as the role of pro-Israel financiers who provided Trump with large financial aid in this process. This shows that Trump is not as powerful in US politics as he claims. We can already say that in the new election cycle, the voters whom Trump promised to end the wars will abandon him. In fact, Israel has made a huge deal of a bid on Trump and the MAGA group. . California National Guard in front of protestors. (Public Domain) . Whether Trump wants it or not, he has become a slave to neocon and Zionist politics. From now on, Iran’s counterattacks and the intensity and tempo of the escalation will also affect Trump’s political future. If Iran attacks U.S. targets and there are U.S. casualties, that would put a strain on Trump and the MAGA group. If Iran retaliates and there are American casualties, Trump could suffer serious reputational damage in the process. Finance-capital does not care about this situation. A new president is found who will respond to his wishes. If the war turns into a protracted war of attrition, we can imagine that finance capital will be able to launch separatist movements and uprisings in Balochistan, Khuzestan and the Kurdish regions of Iran in coordination with MI6, the CIA and the Mossad, as long as the number of lost lives in Israel does not increase. On the other hand, what will happen after this attack is also very important for the future of the Iranian regime. Because, as always, Netanyahu is calling on the Iranian people to rise up in his speech. The Iranian people have not responded to these invitations in the past. On the contrary, hostility towards America and Israel has increased. This time, the attacks on nuclear facilities are in fact an attack on the reputation of the regime and the Iranian people. After the assassinations in the past, this time with the effect of killing many high-level people, this situation may strengthen the bond with the Iranian regime, on the contrary. Therefore, with the support of the people, the Iranian regime will be able to evaluate this attack as an existential attack and increase the escalation and spread the war. Moreover, the Iranian regime will be able to mobilize all its efforts towards the production of nuclear weapons from now on in order to survive. On the other hand, due to the Gaza genocide, Israel’s reputation and credibility in the international arena has been completely destroyed, except for the United States and a few European countries. There is no longer a state that values the unilateral legitimacy of the attacks of an aggressive and lawless state like Israel. The attitude of Russia, China and the Global South towards Israeli aggression will also be decisive in determining the future. . Fire after Israeli attack on 15 June 2025 (Licensed under CC BY 4.0) . Regional and global geopolitical dynamics are now turned upside down. Israel’s attack on Iran does not only affect the Middle East; it will affect continental balances, US-Russia-China relations and the “global race between the great powers”. This Israeli attack will prevent the United States from gathering energy against Russia and China. If Israel and the U.S. fail to achieve their political and military goals after this attack, and if the Iran-US conflict begins, China and Russia’s access to their geopolitical goals will accelerate. A build-up in the region to protect Israel would upset the balance of power in the Pacific theater of operations by the United States. This creates a huge vacuum for Europe and especially for NATO. This attack has opened Pandora’s box. The future of the Khamenei, Netanyahu and Trump regimes is now entirely dependent on Tehran’s decisions. If the escalation increases and the war spreads, Israel and the United States will be affected. If Iran backs down, the regime will collapse. NATO, under the command of Finance Capital, sees the continuation of wars as an existential necessity. NATO’s function came to an end in 1900 when the Berlin Wall fell and Germany was reunited. However, the opposite happened, NATO expanded. The number of members has increased from 16 states to 32 states today. Image: Mark Rutte (Screenshot von der NATO-Plattform) Since taking office on October 1, 2024, NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been making extraordinary efforts to ensure that NATO is not left without enemies. Even the fact that Russia has been turned into NATO’s worst enemy today does not satisfy him. Its main goal is to drag NATO and Russia into the Third World War, in which nuclear weapons will also be used. It continues all kinds of propaganda activities to increase the defense budgets of Canada and European NATO states without limits and almost foolishly making fools of its opponents. Last week at Chatham House, the Pax Britannica’s repository of imperialist minds and ideas, in the presence of British Prime Minister Starmer, the number one Russophobe and warmonger, he said: “NATO’s economic size is 25 times greater than Russia’s… 50 Trillion dollars. Russia’s economy is 2 trillion dollars… However, with this economic size, Russia produces 4 times the ammunition produced by NATO. If we want to keep our people safe, we have to increase our defense spending to 5% of our national income. You can choose not to do that, but in that case, you’d better start learning Russian.” The salaried officer of NATO does not get up to speed and adds. “It is restructuring Russia’s military and producing weapons much faster than expected… Russia could be ready to use military force against Nato within 5 years.” Rutte’s apparent goal is to persuade the 32 participating NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-25. Will it succeed? Hardly. The arguments of Rutte and his fellow London Financial Oligarchy and American neocon representatives will only be welcomed by the governments of states such as France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the three Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which serve the interests of a handful of western oligarchs and neo-oligarchs rather than the interests of their own people. For the last three years, Rutte has been clinging to the propaganda of the US, the EU and the Zionist-controlled collective western media. It is almost peddling a third world war over the fear that Russia, which was deliberately antagonized by NATO’s unlimited expansion after 1999 and forced to make a move over Ukraine, would invade Europe. He is begging for the prolongation of the war in Ukraine. For the past 80 years, Europe has imported prosperity to its people under the security umbrella of the United States. Rutte wants shock treatment to change the 80-year-old habit and for Europe to stand on its own two feet without the United States. He says: “Every ally must do its part, because the United States has borne more than that burden. Europe and Canada will contribute more, while the United States will remain steadfast in its commitment to NATO. Russia is reorganizing its army with Chinese technology and producing weapons much faster than expected. Russia produces ammunition in three months as NATO produces in a year. This year, it is expected to produce 1500 tanks, 3 thousand armored vehicles and 200 Iskander missiles. Russia may be ready to use military force against NATO in 5 years. Let’s not kid ourselves, we are all on the eastern front now. The new generation of Russian missiles is traveling well above the speed of sound. Distances between European capitals are now measured in mere minutes. There is no distinction between east and west, there is only NATO… A 400 percent increase in air and missile defense is required. We see how Russia is spreading fear from the sky in Ukraine. Our armies need thousands of armored vehicles, tanks and millions of artillery shells. We must double our supporting capacities such as logistics, procurement, transport and health support. The Allies will invest in more warships and aircraft. For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” And where are these weapons mostly going to be bought? From the USA, of course. According to representatives of Finance Capital, NATO, which won the Cold War under the leadership of the United States, can do whatever it wants in the European security architecture. According to them, if the Soviets were destroyed without a single shot being fired, this should have continued and Russia should have collapsed as well. The goal was to force Russia into a Yugoslavia-like disintegration and integrate these parts into the western-centered economic and political structures of finance capital. However, this plan did not succeed. Because it is not easy to dismantle a nuclear state. North Korea is standing ground. Rutte’s biggest mistake is that he is making the capability comparison based on national income. The comparison should be made directly on the basis of combat capability. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, which started with a special military operation (SMO) in 2022, opened a new window to the collective west. Cheap blood had been found. Through the Ukrainian regime, Ukrainians would serve US/EU geopolitics and finance capital. The US/EU has poured a huge number of weapons and financial aid into Ukraine. Up to a million Ukrainians have died. Although the war appears to be between Russia and Ukraine, in reality it is still partly between NATO and Russia. What I mean by partial NATO is that the war is being waged without full NATO consensus with the will of the governments in the London financial oligarchy and the US neo/Ziocon sphere of influence, such as the UK, the USA, Italy, France, Germany, Romania, Poland, the three Baltic Republics. Like former NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, Rutte is doing all kinds of stunts for the continuation of the war, even though he does not have the mandate and does not have the authority, and continues to reflect the will of the elite decision-making states within NATO, even though there are no NAC decisions. Turkey maintains its active neutrality thanks to the geopolitical leverage provided by the Montreux Convention on the Straits. However, no one should doubt that collective West is making every effort to remove this lever thanks to the mandate lovers among us. In the words of former secretary general Stoltenberg, NATO provides security for one billion. So the remaining seven billion doesn’t matter. For example, you will not hear any criticism from Rutte against Israel about the genocide in Gaza. Nor can you hear any criticism of last week’s denial of freedom of navigation in the international waters of the Eastern Mediterranean by the Israeli Navy with the argument of a preemptive blockade. In reality, NATO is protecting the interests of the 1% US/EU elite, not the one billion. Because this elite controls financial funds, stock markets and money markets seven times (670 trillion dollars) of the total global national income, that is, 107 trillion dollars. NATO is the instrument of this wheel to create and sustain wars. It needs constant threats. What Rutte says: “For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” Yes, wars are the lifeblood of the military industrial structure. According to Rutte and his ilk, someone must die so that the factories can work. At the end of the wars, cheap raw material resources should be placed at the disposal of finance capital. It seems that a President like Trump, who came to power by challenging this structure with the slogan of MAGA, is not able to stop wars. The endless wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan are obvious. Wars don’t end when presidents say it’s okay. The oligarchic global finance ends with the decision of the capital structure and the war finance and industry. One façade closes, the other opens. In history, there have been states that have challenged the will of finance capital and hegemony. The best example is the Turkish War of Independence and India’s independence under the leadership of Gandhi. Today, the balances are changing rapidly. Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Iran have formed a front of resistance against this impudence, especially in recent years. In the meantime, Trump’s rhetoric and actions about Canada and Denmark (Greenland) cause serious fractures within NATO. However, I think that finance capital will avoid such statements, which will create a fracture within NATO with the discipline of Trump through the Los Angeles uprising, especially in the post-Israel-Iran war period. The US neo/ziocons who serve Israeli geopolitics and global finance capital interests have defeated Trump and the MAGA Group for today. Trump, is now a slave to Israel and neocon interests. After September 11, 2001, Israel and all the states around it was rendered no longer a threat to it. But Iran is different. First of all, it is not like the Arabs. It won’t be an easy bite. Turkey, on the other hand, is the target of the neocon and finance capital world with its obstacles to the establishment of a Kurdish state in the south, our military presence in the TRNC and Cyprus, the sovereign rights provided to us by the Montreux Convention in the Black Sea and the Blue Homeland theses. Today, if the financial capital world controlled by Israel, the US and the EU succeeds in regime change in Iran, they will undoubtedly turn to Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean with this energy and high morale. After the collapse of the Syrian regime, which was the most important buffer state between Turkey and Israel, Turkey became a neighbor of Israel (and therefore the American neocons and ziocons). This is not only a geographical rupture, but a strategic one. This situation shows that Turkey’s southern security doctrine has collapsed. Unfortunately, the interests of the United States and Israel have been served in this process. Israel attacked Iran on June 13 with 200 warplanes. Many of these planes used Syrian airspace. We have contributed to this situation. If Israel enters a confrontation with Turkey tomorrow, it will use Syrian airspace to access Turkey without hindrance. As Israel did to Iran, “pre-emptive strike” or “regime weakening” scenarios can be devised against Turkey. I hope that the politicians in power and the opposition, who supported the collapse of the regime and a functioning state in Syria for sectarian reasons alone , are learning from this picture. The support of the same political group for the Annan Plan in 2004, which will bring the end of the TRNC and our military presence on the island, is also in mind. Israel’s June 13, 2025 attack dramatically affected the geopolitics of the region and the diplomatic and military balances. In this confusion, we need to determine our geopolitical position very clearly. The future of the Iranian regime has become completely dependent on Iran’s actions. If tensions escalate and escalate into a full-scale war, the U.S. and Israel will be shaken, and if Iran withdraws, the regime will collapse. Turkey must clearly determine where it stands in this mess. It should not be forgotten that the collapse of Iran is much more than a regime change. This is the collapse of a regional resistance, that is, the disappearance of the last of Turkey’s geopolitical buffers after Syria. If Iran falls, there will be no defensive line around Turkey, consisting of independent blocs. Syria has already collapsed; Iraq is de facto divided. The message that Turkey will be next in line after Iran is no longer a conspiracy, but a clear expression of the dynamics in the region itself. This is an attack not only on Iran, but also on the independent defense reflexes of finance capital in the face of neocon hegemony. If Iran is a target today, tomorrow Turkey’s geopolitical interests and all its strategic programs and efforts will be turned into legitimate targets. The vacuum created by the collapse of Iran will be filled by new proxies of Israel and the United States. If Turkey remains passive in this process, it will face a hostile generation around itself. Passive diplomacy and the “wait-and-see” reflex produce active siege. Turkey may enter the “next country” pot after the collapse of Iran. “The “Iran Operation” is a message directed at all countries in the region that have independent defense doctrines. If Iran fails to respond, it will collapse. If Turkey does not prepare, it will be next. Turkey should be able to transform its national power into strategic influence. Turkey should not fall into the position of a weak country, especially in the field of Strategy. Israel may have lost its legitimacy, but it is actually establishing influence through its active strategy and ability to move. Turkey should increase its technological, diplomatic and military preparations to transform its power into strategic effectiveness. First of all, internal peace and stability must be established immediately. Internal political settling of scores must be put aside. Under the discourse of Turkey without terrorism, all kinds of initiatives and discourses that will harm the constitutional amendment and the spirit of Lausanne should be avoided. A Monaco Model integration model should be adopted with the TRNC as soon as possible, and naval and air bases should be established on the island quickly. A new army should be established for Southeastern Anatolia, Iraq and Syria, and preventive measures should be taken if necessary against any attempt by the YPG/PYD and similar formations in Syria against an independent Kurdish state. Restrictive measures against the US, EU and Israeli influence agents in Turkey should be taken immediately. In this context, measures should be taken and control measures should be taken in advance to implement the destruction tactics applied in Russia and Iran through drones secretly smuggled into the country by trucks, in areas close to critical bases, factories, strategic locations and command and control centers in Turkey. Our last word: “Think and practice like Atatürk.” Let’s not forget that 100 years ago, the biggest owner of finance capital and hegemony was spoiled by the British; The Turks were the only nation that could slap in the face in Kut Ül Amare, in the War of Independence and in Lausanne and was never a colony. We succeeded 100 years ago and we will succeed again. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

June 18, 2025 08:38 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK,, June 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue.

Title: Diamond Comics' Claim AENT Poached Staff "Fails As A Matter Of Law"

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, AENT, diamond AENT says that Ad Populum's claim against them for poaching staff from Diamond and breaking NDAs "fails as a matter of law" Once upon a time, Diamond Comic Distributors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and held an auction to divide its assets. Alliance Entertainment (AENT) won that auction, with Universal Distribution and Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop coming second as joint bidders. The courts (eventually) declared AENT the winner, but they suddenly pulled out, citing that they had been misled. So the back-up bidders won the auction, with Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop taking Diamond Comic Distributors while Universal got other associated companies. AENT then sued Diamond, alleging fraud over contracts. Then Ad Populum sued AENT, alleging the breaking of NDAs and non-hiring agreements, after AENT hired seven senior former employees of Diamond. Those staff members were: Now, AENT is making the case with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore that Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop has no legal standing to enforce the NDA, as it was not a party to the agreement nor assigned its rights. And claims that the NDA was signed between AENT, Diamond, and Diamond's bankruptcy lawyer, Raymond James. AENT notes that a cease-and-desist letter sent on the 2nd of June, seen below, came from Diamond, not Ad Populum/Sparkle Pop. They state that "prior to the Auction, AENT entered into the NDA with Raymond James, on behalf of itself and DCD. The NDA was entered into because AENT 'requested certain information (oral, written, electronic or otherwise) relating to or concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.' The NDA recognized that AENT signed the agreement 'for the benefit of [DCD] and Raymond James and their respective successors and assigns.' The Complaint does not allege that DCD or Raymond James assigned the NDA to Sparkle Pop. Nor did the Debtors assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as part of the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." They also note that Ad Populum's own evidence proves that AENT did not solicit Diamond's former employees and that Diamond's "internal records reveal that most of the employees in question were terminated as part of a mass-layoff on May 16, 2025, or were seeking alterative employment opportunities months before they resigned, as employee morale tanked and instability permeated." AENT Bruce Ogilvie makes a declaration, which is included in the filing under oath, backing much of this up, saying "Prior to the Auction, AENT entered into a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement with Raymond James & Associates, Inc, on behalf of itself and Debtor DCD. Importantly, Ad Populum is not a party to the NDA. When I signed the NDA on behalf of AENT, it was an agreement between AENT and DCD and its subsidiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries. Further, the Debtors did not assign any rights under the NDA to Sparkle Pop as partof the sale transaction. In fact, the asset purchase agreement between the Debtors and Sparkle Pop expressly states that no contracts are being assigned to Sparkle Pop." "Indeed, counsel for Debtors sent my attorneys a letter, dated June 2, 2025, incorrectly claiming certain alleged breaches of the NDA by AENT caused by AENT's employment of certain former employees of DCD. AENT denies such allegations and maintains that its actions did not violate the NDA or interfere with the business of any party, including Sparkle Pop. It is noteworthy that the letter did not come from Sparkle Pop, but rather DCD and its related Debtors—the only parties to and intended beneficiaries of the NDA." The legal response is summed up, saying "the Complaint and the Motion… fail as a matter of law." There's more, much more to come, of course. Including how my work for Bleeding Cool is being cited in this case. Well, you know how I like to make everything about me, right? But for now, that cease and desist letter. You can use these Diamond, AENT, and Ad Populum tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool. Here's a timeline if you want to catch up… Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Morris Kandinov is investigating Treace Medical Concepts regarding possible breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of law on behalf of shareholders.

On May 7, 2024, after market hours, when the company issued a press release reporting, among other things, that it lowered its full-year 2024 revenue guidance from between $220 million and $225 million to between $201 million and $211 million. During the associated earnings call the same day, defendants revealed competition from minimally invasive osteotomy and Lapiplasty “knockoffs” created headwinds for Lapiplasty growth. On this news, the company’s stock price fell $6.95, or nearly 63%, to close at $4.17 per share on May 8, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: Amazon to Cut More Jobs as It Expands Use of AI Agents

After eliminating nearly 27,000 jobs in 2023, Amazon is preparing for another round of layoffs. This time, the job cuts stem from the rapid growth and efficiency of AI. "As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees. The memo didn't specify the departments that would be impacted, but it highlighted AI agents as key to the company's future. They can engage in deep research, write code, and "change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers," Jassy said. Currently, Amazon has over 1,000 generative AI services and apps in progress. In the future, the company hopes to use agents that can act as "teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work," Jassy added. The Amazon executive didn't provide a timeline for the layoffs. He, however, stated that efficiency gains from AI will reduce the company's total corporate workforce in the next few years. Jobs of some warehouse workers and delivery agents may also be at risk. The company started testing humanoid robots at a Seattle warehouse in 2023. These robots could move, grasp, and handle items just like human workers. More recently, the e-commerce giant was rumored to be testing similar robots for doorstep delivery. The robots are expected to hop on the back of a Rivian van and step out to drop off packages. The Prime Air drone service, on the other hand, has already begun delivering iPhones, Galaxy phones, AirPods, and more in less than 60 minutes in eligible areas. In April, Duolingo had also announced AI-driven job cuts. CEO Luis von Ahn wanted to make the language learning platform an AI-first company and gradually stop using contractors for work AI can handle. However, after facing backlash from users, von Ahn backtracked on his plans, stating, "I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do." Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Amazon CEO says AI set to take jobs due to "efficiency" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has announced advancements in AI, and the technology's integration across many of the company's operations, will likely reduce the firm's headcount over the next five years due to efficiency gains. In a letter to workers, CEO Andy Jassy boasted that more than 1,000 AI services and apps area already in progress or built, and many more are to come. Jassy name-dropped a few of the successful deployments and upcoming rollouts, including its next-generation smart personal assistant Alexa+, the AI Shopping Assistant, seller tools and advertiser tools. Ultimately, artificial intelligence could end up changing the nature of work, requiring fewer people in some roles but more in others. The ecommerce giant has already laid off an estimated 27,000 workers since 2022, including recent cuts in devices, services and books divisions, but it seems that widespread tech layoffs could be far from over for Amazonians. AI has also proven instrumental in allowing Amazon to improve its inventory, forecasting, robot efficiency and customer service, but Jassy's letter remained consistent with one key theme – a strong emphasis on internal productivity improvements through the use of generative and agentic AI. With capabilities spanning task completion, research, code writing and workflow automation, Jassy sees AI agents are critical for faster innovation and better customer experiences, however the downside of that is that the tech will enable leaner teams to achieve more, reducing the need for as many workers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite the threat of AI taking their roles, Jassy urged workers to be "curious" about the tech, experiment and innovate with it, and further their learning. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.," Jassy explained. "It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce." Jassy's comment about knowing where this nets out in the future is a relevant one. Although many experts predict that AI could lead to net job creation, it could mean that some companies (like Amazon) end up reducing their headcount, while others see growth.

Title: Employees were already freaked out about AI — Amazon just proved them right

The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not. On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant. In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce. Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. "So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job." Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs. BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish. Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools. The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession. Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend. "I'm totally expecting a tightening," he said. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing." Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often "ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill." Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said. "So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said. Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs." Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces. While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting. "Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said. Jump to

Title: Amazon employees slam CEO Andy Jassy's memo about AI killing corporate jobs

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees on Tuesday that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains" as the driving force. Amazon employees weren't having it. Across internal Slack channels, Amazon's white-collar workers tore into Jassy's message, taking aim at his leadership and unapologetic push for AI, according to messages seen by Business Insider. BI viewed dozens of messages found across three different internal channels, which include thousands of employees in total. The criticism was widespread across the channels. Some called for a shift in the company's mindset and warned of the risks of relying too much on AI. Others voiced blunt concerns about looming layoffs, while a few demanded that leadership share in the fallout. "There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years," one person wrote in Slack. Some Amazon employees seemed to agree with Jassy's move. One person wrote that middle management in general could be replaced by Amazon's AI app and "no one would notice," alluding to the company's decision to reduce management layers this year. "At least he said the quiet part out loud," another employee wrote. "We all knew it but now it's clearly part of the plan." An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. One key debate centered on how AI should be positioned within a corporate environment. Many of the internal Slack messages noted that a 50% productivity boost from AI gives companies two options: Reduce the workforce and maintain current output, or keep the team intact and grow the business. Amazon, in this case, is choosing to do the same with less, they argued. "We need to lead the change in reframing AI as partners (even teammates or colleagues) rather than AI as replacements or tools," one person wrote. "It's a slightly different vision than the one Andy alludes to." Another person wrote that Jassy was defining success as "a smaller corporate workforce," not in terms of customer satisfaction. BI previously reported that Amazon was freezing its hiring budget for its retail business this year. "He, as the CEO, has shown he can deliver on one of those things and not the other," this person wrote. Others voiced concerns about leaning too heavily on AI without proper safeguards. While some found summary tools useful, employees warned that AI isn't always a reliable source of truth. It can lead to poor decisions and a future in which people turn to AI to solve problems it caused in the first place, they said. "It's dangerous, and it will have real consequences," one of the employees wrote. Some employees questioned whether Tuesday's memo signaled more layoffs ahead. One said any message from Jassy filled them with instant "deep dread," while another said they saw it as yet another example of his relentless focus on cost cutting over the years. "This seems to be the [antithesis] of Think Big, and is part of a continual trend that our CEO doesn't seem to have a vision for the company other than 'do what we do today cheaper, and also AI will happen,'" one of the people wrote. Some employees took a cynical view of the role of senior executives, questioning why AI-driven cuts seem to target rank-and-file workers while top leadership remains untouched. Amazon's senior S-team, for example, has only expanded under Jassy's watch. "Will it result in less SVPs?" one of the people wrote. Have a tip?

Title: Andy Jassy is the perfect Amazon CEO for the looming Gen AI (cost-cutting) era

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told hundreds of thousands of his employees on Tuesday that generative AI is coming for their jobs and that their best bet is to embrace the technology. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. But no matter how geeked Amazon employees get over new AI tools, Jassy also made a point to note that there’s not room on the bus for everybody: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” As I read this note—and I recommend reading the whole thing—some questions quickly came to mind. Are some parts of Amazon’s vast organization highly resistant to the new technology and perhaps in need of a public nudge (or kick in the butt), in Jassy’s view? Seems likely. Is the public memo a wink-wink to Wall Street that the company’s heavy AI investments will eventually pay off by delivering significant cost reductions? I suppose. Is the note meant to provide some glossy AI cover for imminent or future mass layoffs that may have nothing, or just something, to do with AI actually eating some corporate tasks? I guess that’s possible too, though I find it less likely. And are the parts of the essay where Jassy methodically outlines the various ways Amazon already uses gen AI—a ritutal he has performed publicly on more than one occasion this year—designed to thrust Amazon into AI-dominated news cycles that often feature many other companies not named Amazon? Perhaps. No matter the exact goal or impetus, and Amazon isn’t saying what exactly the impetus for this public memo was, Jassy seems like the right leader for the current job—especially on the cost-cutting, or, as he referred to it in his annual shareholder letter in April, the “cost avoidance and productivity” bucket of gen-AI impact. I don’t mean to discount Jassy’s ability to lead on the innovation front. He transformed and led Amazon Web Services, after all, from its infancy into the behemoth cloud provider it is today. But ever since taking over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy has also become the company’s chief cost-cutter and has appeared comfortable in the role. He has overseen the largest corporate layoffs in company history in recent years, joining other Big Tech companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Salesforce, which all slashed headcounts after overhiring in the pandemic. His logistic teams have rejiggered the U.S. warehouse network and inventory systems to reduce the cost of getting each product to a customer. And he’s also pushed teams to accelerate the automation of some warehouse tasks, which over time could allow the company to do more with less—or at least more with the same. Some of these moves were necessitated by Bezos handing over to Jassy a bloated and sometimes wasteful company when the CEO transition happened nearly four years ago. But it also appears to this close observer of the company that Jassy is quite comfortable in the role; though whether he enjoys it or simply accepts it I don’t know. So, whether Amazon’s AI jobs shakeout turns out to be a painful retrenching, a gradual recalibration, or something else entirely, recent history seems to suggest the company, if nothing else, has the right man for the job.

Title: Amazon Preps Employees for Layoffs by Talking Up the Power of AI Agents

Amazon appears to be soft-launching its next round of layoffs. In a message to employees shared Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy talked highly of the company’s embrace of artificial intelligence tools across its company, and said that it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. That is only slightly veiled corporate speak for “get ready to be replaced.” Jassy called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that will change the way the company operates, and said Amazon is already using it in “virtually every corner of the company.” According to Jassy, Amazon already has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, and said, “thatâs a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” So it’s clear the company is all in on AI. Amazon previously said it would commit $100 billion to investing in AI technologies this year. As for humans? Well, it seems Amazon is not so committed to them long-term. Jassy told the company’s 1.5 million employees that generative AI will “change the way our work is done,” and said that the company will ultimately “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” The underlying message: you might soon be out of work. “Itâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote. The CEO did offer his workers, some of whom are likely wondering just how long they’ll be employed, how to potentially survive the next round of layoffs (or, maybe more likely, help train their future replacements). “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your teamâs brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has been in the process of stripping its workforce down to the bones in departments it seems to care less about. The company cut about 100 people from its devices and services team earlier this year, and around the same number from its books department. Per CNBC, it has laid off about 27,000 people since 2022 and has its eyes on further cuts. It’s hard to look at Jassy’s AI-forward message as much else other than an indicator that more layoffs are just around the corner. It’s possible the AI hype is just a cynical attempt to position itself as being an industry leader when the real goal is cutting salaries to boost stock price. It wouldn’t be the first company to try to go all-in on AI at the expense of human labor. Earlier this year, Klarna announced it was bringing back human customer service representatives after trying to leave the task to AI after finding the outcomes aren’t great and people don’t really like dealing with AI agents.

Title: Amazon CEO Says AI Will Lead to Layoffs and ‘Change the Way Our Work Is Done,’ Tells Employees: ‘Be Curious About AI, Educate Yourself’

Andy Jassy tells employees to 'be curious about AI, educate yourself' By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Amazon chief executive officer Andy Jassy outlined a near future where AI will “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” — but at the same time, he said, the technology will cut the overall number of jobs at the ecommerce giant. In a memo Tuesday to Amazon employees, Jassy shared “Some thoughts on Generative AI.” “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Related Stories How 'The Gilded Age' Shot in Newport's Historic Mansions, and Brought a Tourism Boom to the Wealthy Rhode Island Enclave ‘Harry Potter’ HBO Series Finds Molly Weasley, Draco and Lucius Malfoy and More Hogwarts Students According to an Amazon spokesperson, Jassy’s reference to a reduction in workforce does not necessarily mean layoffs; for example, the company could offer voluntary early retirement packages. Popular on Variety As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. Jassy encouraged Amazon employees to “be curious about AI” and “educate yourself.” “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy wrote. Nine months ago, Jassy informed Amazon’s corporate staffers they were expected to report to the office five days per week, so the company will be “better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” Today, Amazon is investing “quite expansively” in generative AI, according to Jassy’s June 17 memo. The company has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built to date, “but at our scale, that’s a small fraction of what we will ultimately build,” the CEO said. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI. I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners, and how we work,” Jassy wrote. Jassy took over the role of Amazon’s CEO in July 2021 from founder Jeff Bezos, who is now executive chairman. After joining the company in 1997, Jassy started the Amazon Web Services group and led it for nearly 20 years. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/17/2025 1:00:18 PM PDT by Cronos As thousands of young graduates prepare to take their first steps on the job market, an unexpected obstacle stands in their way: artificial intelligence. The technological promise that was supposed to relieve us of repetitive tasks seems, paradoxically, to be blocking the access of new generations to the professional world. The broken path to employment Traditionally, young people start their careers with internships, junior positions or simple assignments that allow them to learn and work their way up. But as Aneesh Raman, Head of Business Opportunities at LinkedIn, explains, “the first rung of the career ladder is disappearing”. The reason for this? It is precisely these introductory tasks – administrative, repetitive, often unskilled – that companies are now entrusting to generative AI. Tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are already automating tasks previously carried out by young employees: writing bits of code, data entry, administrative assistance… The result? A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks. Companies such as Duolingo and Shopify are already actively reducing the recruitment of juniors for these roles, preferring to entrust them to AI systems. A bleak future for young people? Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

The resources for training is going for AI Models through Machine Learning & not for training human resources. Human resources get their training through self-service. What they should instead be saying is: “What are the resources and recommendations on what I can do to proactively do continuous learning and self-service for gaining new skills that the company needs?” Anyone not a proactive self-starter on working & learning (and most importantly on getting feedback from their management to ensure they are aligned with the fast changing needs of their business unit) is moving themselves to the front of the line for layoffs or exclusion on getting new jobs. Companies just won’t have much use for humans that act like machines that have to be instructed on everything. 4 posted on 06/17/2025 1:08:30 PM PDT by Degaston [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: algore AI with robotics already flip burgers.

But as Aneesh Raman, Head of Business Opportunities at LinkedIn, explains, “the first rung of the career ladder is disappearing”. The reason for this? It is precisely these introductory tasks – administrative, repetitive, often unskilled – that companies are now entrusting to generative AI. Tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are already automating tasks previously carried out by young employees: writing bits of code, data entry, administrative assistance… The result? A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks.

Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground. An AI will not flip burgers, nor will it do manual labor. Will it replace some jobs? probably but not tomorrow or next year If these training opportunities are fading and AI can’t also replace the upper jobs then industry had better figure something out for succession. I am not impressed with what AI has been able to do so far as human interaction is concerned. Neither am I very impressed with the scripted response readers in the “administrative” functions. On drill ships automation resulted in a need to double bed space and a lot more helicopter flights. Here’s a good sentence for every Gen-Z worker (and others) to remember to NOT ask in their work duties and job hunting. “How do I get training from the company” Here is what they need to remember. The resources for training is going for AI Models through Machine Learning & not for training human resources. Human resources get their training through self-service. What they should instead be saying is: “What are the resources and recommendations on what I can do to proactively do continuous learning and self-service for gaining new skills that the company needs?” Anyone not a proactive self-starter on working & learning (and most importantly on getting feedback from their management to ensure they are aligned with the fast changing needs of their business unit) is moving themselves to the front of the line for layoffs or exclusion on getting new jobs. Companies just won’t have much use for humans that act like machines that have to be instructed on everything. AI with robotics already flip burgers. And the cost is going down. Burger flipping at McDonald’s is already standardised so perfect for automation. The only question is the break even point in terms of cost. AI will also make manual lanor more efficient, think if your roomba The beginning jobs is what immigration wiped out, it seems some are left that AI can take over. “An AI will not flip burgers, nor will it do manual labor.” So? We will then be working for AI? “Will it replace some jobs? probably but not tomorrow or next year” It already has and is right now... Are you invested in this technology? Only someone who is invested in AI technology does not care or see the danger it poses... First of all specialize in a field where there is a demand for those types of jobs. Then suck it up and get whatever education and training and is required to be competitive and study and work hard. Then suck it up and get whatever education and training and is required to be competitive and study and work hard. “””Traditionally, young people start their careers with internships, junior positions or simple assignments that allow them to learn and work their way up. “”””” What BS. In my day new hires were expected to do the job on day one after getting a turnover from the person who previously held the job. It seems that 21 year old children now expect they will attend training classes for the next 10 years before they actually have to do the work proscribed in the job. “Only someone who is invested in AI technology does not care or see the danger it poses...” What danger? I am reminded of the old days when the power went out we just started a “Cash Box” to continue doing business and keep life moving. With no humans to pick up the baton the world will come to a stand still because AI has been switched off. What will we do with all those extra unneeded humans? The Globalists who are shoving this crap down our throats know exactly what to do with those extra humans. Exterminate them. Is it really wise to put all of our eggs in one basket for just that one extra penny more profit? Are we caging and enslaving ourselves with this? You bet... We are are going to be absolutely sorry we let ourselves become dependent on this technology... Used to be that kids and teens learned the value of paid work by mowing lawns, delivering newspapers, and working in fast food stores. Now all those jobs are held by adult migrants. Early every morning, I see pickup trucks delivering the Los Angeles Times (often one adult at the wheel, and one in the back tossing the papers). Migrants do landscaping. And adult migrants now make a lifetime "career" by working at a fast food joint. Early every morning, I see pickup trucks delivering the Los Angeles Times (often one adult at the wheel, and one in the back tossing the papers). Migrants do landscaping. And adult migrants now make a lifetime "career" by working at a fast food joint. Besides AI, there are many things which will contribute to a financial, as well as intellectual and cultural divide in this country. As a small example - my son just graduated college and started his first job. He faces a wide choice of many different programs offered by the employer - from 401K, IRAs, to 5 levels of Obama health-care, to HSA, to FSA, to disability insurance to extended disability insurance, all of which have differing costs with different levels of risk/reward. Then there is the complexity of the tax code as well, IRAs He can figure it out easily enough himself, and then track, manage, and optimize these programs over the next several decades of his career/life. But what about those 50% of Americans with below 99 IQ? It seems the complexity of life, money, finance, debt and law will almost necessarily lead them to be working drones - or government dependents. Well, if it is taking their jobs now, it will be takin the jobs from those who currently have jobs when they are no longer needed. So the fear remains justified.

Title: Amazon CEO Tells Staffers to Expect AI-Related Layoffs: ‘It Should Change the Way Our Work Is Done’
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-ceo-warns-staff-ai-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T19:26:53Z

“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Andy Jassy says in a Tuesday memo Amazon CEO Andy Jassy informed staffers that they should anticipate potential layoffs across the company as they expedite the implementation of artificial intelligence in an effort to boost and/or improve the customer experience. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote in a message to employees on Tuesday. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The potential layoffs could impact many across Amazon’s workforce, which consists of about 1,556,000 full-time and part-time staffers globally. Jassy mentioned that Amazon now has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress, adding that the amount is just a small fraction of what the company would ideally like to build. While noting that Amazon has already shifted into an AI-leaning model, highlighting its rollout of Alexa+ and the use of its AI shopping assistant, Jassy further encouraged workers to become “curious about AI.” “Educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy, who started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, wrote. For now, he shared that Amazon has only scratched the surface in its heavy pivot to AI-powered tools and resources, but added that he believes the technology will “change how we all work and live.” “Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time,” his message continued. “There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast.” Lastly, the executive shared that he’s excited about the future of AI at the company and that he hopes his staff will take part in its journey. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI,” Jassy concluded. “I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners and how we work.”

Title: Amazon’s Jassy says AI will reduce company’s corporate ranks

Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy says he expects the company’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the retail and cloud-computing giant uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Generative AI and AI-powered software agents “should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday that laid out his thinking about how the emerging technology will transform the workplace. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” From the start of the AI boom, people inside and outside the industry have raised concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to replace workers. Those concerns have only grown as tech companies introduce more sophisticated AI systems that can write code and field online tasks on a user’s behalf. Shopify Inc. told employees that requests for new headcount will require an explanation as to why AI can’t do the job. Duolingo Inc. said it would “gradually stop” using contractors to do work that artificial intelligence can handle. And Microsoft Corp. recently announced a round of layoffs that hit software developers hardest. Dario Amodei, CEO of OpenAI rival Anthropic, recently warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and cause unemployment to spike to as high as 20% over the next five years. Amazon, which has prioritized automation in logistics and headquarters roles for years, is investing heavily in AI. Jassy, in his letter, rattled off some of those initiatives, including the Alexa+ voice software, a shopping assistant, and tools for developers and businesses sold by the Amazon Web Services cloud unit. Inside the company, Amazon has used AI tools for inventory placement, customer service and product listings. Jassy encouraged employees to “experiment with AI whenever you can.” “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he said. Amazon is the largest private U.S. employer after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but about 350,000 of them have corporate jobs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy admits AI will ‘reduce’ corporate workforce

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy ominously warned Tuesday that he expects the rise of generative artificial intelligence to “reduce” the company’s corporate workforce in the next few years. The Amazon boss, who replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021, said generative AI is a “once in a lifetime” technology that “should change the way our work is done” as the company integrates it into its business operations. As a result, Amazon will “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in lengthy memo to employees that was also posted on the company’s website. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy added. Amazon had a corporate workforce of approximately 350,000 employees as December. Overall, the company had more than 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year, including at its warehouse and fulfillment centers. Jassy said Amazon already has more than 1,000 generative AI services or applications in the works, which will “small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” Amazon’s inventory management, customer service chatbot and product pages are likely to get an upgrade as a result of AI. Employees should “be curious about AI” and participate in efforts to learn “how to get more done with scrappier teams,” he added. The remarks come as more AI leaders call out the likelihood that advancements in AI will shake up the labor market. Last month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei raised alarms when he warned that executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur in fields like tech, finance and law and be honest with workers. Amodei said he expects significant job losses in the next one to five years, with US unemployment potentially spiking to 20%, up from its current level of 4.2%. In a dire scenario, AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs, he suggested. Amazon isn’t the only company likely to experience a major workforce shakeup as a result of generative AI. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently said he expects AI to take on a bigger role within Meta’s workforce. “Probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” Zuckerberg said during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. Elsewhere, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned in April 2023 that he expected “knowledge workers,” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers, to be at risk. Advertisement

Title: Recruiting Landscape For Private Equity Sees Major Shift

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Tired of hiring first-year analysts who already have private-equity job offers, some banks are ... More looking to redefine the traditional recruiting timeline. Young bankers looking to break into private equity could be looking at a new recruiting timeline. In recent years, many of the top firms in the country have recruited aspiring bankers and investment managers for post-grad jobs two years in advance. Fighting for coveted internships, many recruits begin their first full-time job with a signed offer for their second already secured, but with a delayed start date of two years. It’s a typical practice for competitive positions in other industries, too. Law students seeking to work in Big Law, for example, often seek out their second year summer associate job during the spring and summer after their first year, with the hopes of getting an offer for a full-time position at the same firm after. But JPMorgan is over it. The bank told incoming graduates that they would be fired if they accept future job offers at other companies before starting at the bank or within their first 18 months of employment, according to Bloomberg. Private equity firms are already responding. Apollo Global Management told prospective investment banking applicants that it won’t extend offers to the class of 2027 this year. Still, while recruiting potential hires so early might seem counterproductive, it’s what many big banks have resorted to in order to beat out competition for the best talent. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. From mapping career pivots to drafting application materials, this is how you can use AI to help in your next job search. Avoid these seven phrases to make your cover letter stand out. How to make the best use of “vibe coding” to make AI apps for work. Full return-to-office mandates were all the rage at the start of the year, with firms like Amazon and Dell calling their employees back on-site. Six months after implementation, some workers are filing disability claims and employee morale is falling. It’s been six months since thousands of U.S. workers were brought back into the office full-time, and many returning employees are now unhappy, unmotivated and even complaining about the lack of disability accommodations. Workers across generations are unsatisfied with RTO, according to the Adaption Institute, and more days in the office is not improving burnout or intent-to-quit rates. At JPMorgan, an internal culture study found that fewer employees feel like their health and well-being are a corporate priority, likely triggered by the bank’s strict five-day in-office policy. Then there are those who say that their requests for exemption from RTO mandates due to disabilities are not being heard. Employees at Amazon have filed disability complaints both with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, two federal agencies tasked with regulating working conditions. In one complaint, workers allege the company is deleting posts in internal chat rooms that share dissatisfaction with the RTO process, according to Bloomberg. But not all companies are forcing their employees to come back to the office. Bankers at Citibank, for example, are seeing the opposite response, as the bank’s hybrid employees will be able to work remotely for two weeks of their choice in August, according to its new policy. Working Euro-summer, anyone? News from the world of work. Many companies don’t instinctively know how to hire and support disabled employees. Forbes’ Accessibility 100 ranked the best companies building accessibility tools across teams and industries. From crafting better job descriptions to creating workplaces where different ways of thinking can thrive, these companies are opening doors to jobs that were once inaccessible. President Donald Trump’s new travel ban is already having widespread impacts. For one, foreign doctors slated to start their residencies in July from the 19 countries banned may not be able to enter the U.S. at all, exacerbating the country’s doctor shortage. Despite the persistent calls for increased deportations from the president, the Trump Organization continues to bring in foreign workers to staff its clubs and winery, Forbes’ Zach Everson reports. The company has filed to bring in at least 1,880 seasonal workers since 2008, and this year has posted intentions to hire 31 foreign workers on temporary visas to work for its winery through October. New York state updated its WARN notice requirements—which identify mass layoffs for companies with more than 50 employees—to include robotics or AI-related cuts. It marks the first time employers will have to explicitly disclose if automation is replacing workers, which could lead to more worker protections down the line. The line between showbiz and content creators is blurring. Forbes’ Top Creators list, which ranks the 50 richest influencers across Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, is filled with creators who have started their own media and entertainment companies, as private funding into such brands explodes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nes2RvbSHtk How To Calculate Your Total Salary and Compensation with Katie Gatti Tassin As companies cut middle-management positions, what firm is planning to hire assistant managers for all of its stores by 2026?

Title: Bitcoin treasury hype will burst like memecoin supercycle – Crypto VC

Here’s why crypto VCs doubt whether Bitcoin and altcoin treasury trend will last. Bitcoin [BTC] treasuries and copy-cats based on Ethereum [ETH] and altcoins will be over within two years, according to Haseeb Qureshi, founder of crypto VC Dragonfly. In an X post, Qureshi linked the ‘treasury meta’ to ‘hot money’ that will end like last year’s token launch. “But hot money never stays put, which is why treasury companies will not be the final meta. But I’d guess 1-2 years of this until the heat dies down.” Source: Hosseeb/X Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital, echoed Qureshi’s remarks but added that the narrative will be shorter than the ‘memecoin supercycle.’ “Markets get smarter over time, and as a result, every new meta is shorter and shorter lived…Memecoin euphoria, now —> public vehicles. They all live shorter lives as a function of market forces.” Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries collectively hold about $367 billion worth of capital as of June. Notably, BTC-focused firms hold 3.44 million BTC or $364B based on the current market price. On the other hand, ETH treasury firms have accumulated 1.16 million ETH, worth $3 billion. Notably, most of the BTC flows from public treasuries are driven primarily by Strategy and Metaplanet. However, some analysts have raised concerns that these firms’ debt leverage to acquire BTC could trigger a market crash if they go bankrupt. In response, Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn rebutted the claims, stating that debt concerns were ‘overblown’ because most maturities will begin in 2027. For perspective, BTC treasuries have $12.7 billion in debt, and Strategy dominates at $8.2B or 64% of the total debt. Nearly $10 billion of the debt stock is due for payment between 2027 and 2028. This timeline fits well with Qureshi’s projection, in case the bubble bursts. Source: Galaxy Research Overall, the crypto treasury meta has been printing more returns than the underlying assets, attracting most investors. However, for risk management purposes, the 2027-2028 period could be a key watchlist, especially if the firms fail to pay back their debt.

June 17, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. PALO ALTO, Calif., June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is announcing the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.0, the platform for the modern private cloud. With VCF 9.0, customers gain a consistent operating model for the private cloud, spanning data centers, edge, and managed cloud infrastructure from service providers and hyperscalers. VCF 9.0 combines the agility and scalability of public cloud with the security, performance, architectural control and total cost of ownership (TCO) benefits of an on-premises environment. VCF 9.0 delivers a single unified platform that supports all applications—traditional, modern, or AI—with consistent operations, governance, and controls across the private cloud environment. With VCF 9.0, customers benefit from a modern private cloud that: “With this next generation of our cloud platform, VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, we are again raising the bar for the modern private cloud by vastly simplifying the deployment, operations, and developer experience of the cloud,” said Krish Prasad, senior vice president and general manager, VCF Division, Broadcom. “Most enterprises are now looking to the private cloud to run both traditional mission-critical and new AI and containerized applications. VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 is the ideal platform for running these modern applications, enabling our customers to be more innovative, efficient, resilient, and secure. We are very excited to see that customers of all sizes are embracing VCF at a rate that has exceeded even our own high expectations.” “VMware Cloud Foundation has enabled us to execute on our private cloud strategy by breaking down IT silos, removing technical debt, and allowing teams to shift from focusing on keeping the lights on to higher value projects that move our business forward,” said Roger Joys, Principal Technology Strategy Advisor, Cloud & Data, GCI Communications. “By delivering an ‘everything as code’ private cloud platform, we simply do everything faster and more securely now. Security patches are easier to implement, new applications are deployed in minutes rather than months, and services are updated and rolled out to customers in a fraction of the time. These are all benefits people only thought were possible in the public cloud. We are doing these things in our modern private cloud.” “VMware Cloud Foundation is at the core of our Digital Application Platform. Using VCF, we have expanded our on-prem delivery capabilities while improving operational efficiency,” said Paolo Bazzica, chief information officer, IPZS. “At IPZS, we feel that we are now on the right track to continue supporting Italy's digital transition with a modern private cloud that enables full use of our competences to deliver cloud native applications. Compared to more traditional on-prem setup, we saw a steep IT manual tasks reduction by up to 70% through automation while improving our business resilience.” “With VMware Cloud Foundation, we can offer our customers a private cloud operating model from our own data center,” said Michael Heier, Head of Managed Workplace, Ratiodata. “VCF offers a significantly more flexible and easier-to-manage IT infrastructure with its automation, advanced security features, dynamic networking capabilities, and comprehensive cloud management. VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service enables us to deliver a unified platform for both VM and containerized apps, while VMware Private AI allows us to securely harness AI capabilities across this infrastructure. Increased server performance and superior VM density will reduce our total number of servers, lowering power consumption and costs by an estimated 25–30%.” “Previously we had a large-scale legacy IT infrastructure that needed to evolve into something that was very agile, flexible, cost-optimized and secure,” said Keith Woolley, Chief Digital and Information Officer, University of Bristol. “With VMware Cloud Foundation, University of Bristol has built a modern private cloud that completely revolutionizes the way we operate and deliver services to our academic community. VCF enables us to run our AI jobs. It gives us the sovereignty we were seeking. And we know there's hidden benefits in the VCF platform that we're only just starting to discover.” The Fundamental Shifts in VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0​VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 boasts a completely new architecture that empowers IT admins and application teams to accomplish far more and spend far less. The platform delivers a streamlined experience for building, operating, and securing a modern private cloud across on-premises data centers, in hyperscaler and VMware Cloud Service provider clouds, and at the edge. VCF 9.0 is uniquely designed to remove the friction between infrastructure and application teams. One Interface for Private Cloud OperationsVCF 9.0 introduces a unified interface for cloud administrators, offering a holistic view of private cloud operations. The new Quick Start App significantly reduces setup time and complexity. Integrated cost management and policy enforcement enables immediate compliance and operational efficiency. Scalable fleet management allows administrators to plan, schedule, and execute upgrades across clusters efficiently, increasing daily productivity up to 10x1. Centralized identity and access management, including single sign-on, password policies, and certificates, enable consistency across environments.

June 17, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: This AI Fund’s 7.3% Payout Looks Great, But One Chart Screams ‘Sell’

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Shot of two young businesspeople working ,Two business man and women discussing over digital tablet ... More at desk in office . Success, Teamwork,Technology, Working, There’s a 7.3%-paying AI fund out there that looks like the perfect buy—7.3% yield, growing payout and special dividends. Yet, if you hold this one, I urge you to sell yesterday. It’s a dilemma we’ve all faced: There’s a stock or fund we’re aching to buy—but there are just one or two things holding us back. That’s certainly the case here. In fact, at pretty well any other time, we’d fall all over ourselves to buy this dominating tech play. At my CEF Insider service, we’ve done just that in the past. But not today. Today we’re putting this one on the shelf—and I urge you to do the same. But not to worry: There will be another opportunity to strike here. Let’s rattle through this quixotic fund’s strengths. Then we’ll get to the reasons for our decision to steer clear of it. First, let me introduce this fund, whose name includes a clue as to both its appeal and our reason for selling: the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). We held AIO in CEF Insider from 2020 to 2023. And it yields even more today than it did when we bought back then: 7.3% versus 6.4%. And, as mentioned, the portfolio is strong. In fact, management has done a solid job playing the AI trend, combining shares of firms that directly participate in AI development, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META), with those smartly adopting AI to cut costs and boost profits, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and insurer Progressive (PGR). AIO’s team is savvy about going beyond the obvious AI plays to find companies that are underpriced relative to how much AI can transform them. The fund’s 101% total NAV return since its launch, which was just before the pandemic, is testament to that. AIO Total Returns (Total NAV return tracks the performance of a CEF’s portfolio, including dividends collected, rather than its return based on market price—it’s the best indicator of management’s stock-picking prowess.) That strong return has, in turn, helped AIO not only raise its regular dividend but pay out huge special dividends. The fund is overdue for another. In short, AIO is a strong fund with a lot going for it: right mandate for the times, great management and a payout set to rise. And yet it’s still a sell. Let’s get into why now. Astute market followers might think that, since the VIX—the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—has fallen to one of its lowest levels this year, concern about a selloff is rising. That suggests complacency, which is risky considering simmering global-trade issues and still-unresolved U.S. tariffs. The good news is that President Donald Trump will likely settle on a lower level of tariffs than what was feared in April. Even so, volatility is lower than it should be, given trade worries—and a spike could hit AIO hard, especially when you consider the factor we’ll look at next. AIO Premium to NAV Above we see the fund’s premium to NAV, which plainly tells us that investors are paying 8.8% more for AIO than its portfolio is actually worth. That’s the fund’s highest premium ever, and AIO hasn’t seen a double-digit discount for more than a year. That, combined with the potential for higher market volatility, is why it is time to step back from this one. Of course, a selloff would likely see AIO’s premium drop to a big discount, as occurred in April. If so, the fund would be an attractive buy. In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if we see this play out in 2025—very likely by the end of 2026. Until then, it’s time to pass on AIO and wait for its premium to evaporate. Then we’d be nicely set to scoop it up, ride it back to a premium (enjoying its payouts as we do), then sell. It’s the classic CEF profit cycle. AIO is simply at the wrong end of it—for now.

Title: Buying local a challenge for this small-town Colorado grocery store

WALSH — Everyone in Walsh wants in on the lettuce. It’s so pretty, they say to one another on the street. Way better than that iceberg stuff. And it keeps so well, they all agree. The lettuces arrive with the roots still attached. Romaine, red leaf and some silky looking butterhead, delivered the same day they’re harvested from The Summers House in La Junta. That the town has lettuce on its main drag at all has been the subject of great amazement since 2006, after a harsh year when the grocery store shuttered, and two subsequent blizzards blocked all roads to everywhere, leaving the town of 650 people stranded without a grocer. Five residents got together that fall to brainstorm ways to bring the store back. They settled on a co-op model, giving everyone in town a chance to be part-owner, and reached out to a food distributor in Amarillo, Texas, about 180 miles south of Walsh. LEFT: A family sits on a bench outside of Walsh Community Grocery Store on Saturday. RIGHT: From left, Jessica Wright, director of nutrition for Nourish Colorado, chef Taylor Frederick and Caitlyn Stuart, manager of outreach and partnerships, serve melon and cucumber salad to Baca County Sheriff’s posse member Steve Sanchez, during the store’s annual customer appreciation day. (Jeremy Sparig, Special to The Colorado Sun) “The folks at Affiliated Foods had a pool going about how long we’d last,” said Rick Mills, one of the original brainstormers and board members. “Didn’t think we’d last 10 weeks.” Walking down North Colorado Street on Saturday, during an annual town gathering called Walsh Days, Mills ran into Jamie Hume, one of the founding five, and a former board member himself. “I was just talking about the bet,” Mills told Hume. “They didn’t think we’d last six months,” Hume finished. Whether it was 10 weeks or six months, whether there was a betting pool at all, doesn’t really matter much. What matters is that they felt the odds stacked against them and made a gamble of their own, selling $50 shares and buying the Walsh Community Grocery Store back from the bank. But that story has been told: to the Denver Post, to the Pueblo Chieftain, to a PBS program called “America’s Heartland,” even to People magazine. Now 17 years in business, Walsh Community Grocery Store is entering what manager Meta Jo Riseling is hoping will be its next chapter, one where shelves are stocked with fresh food from Colorado farmers and ranchers. And she’s starting with lettuce. One of the biggest challenges of getting food to Walsh are the roads. Or, rather, the road. U.S. 160, which runs east from Trinidad and into Kansas, passing through Walsh on its way, isn’t on any local farmers’ distribution routes. So while Riseling has long had ambitions to bring Colorado agriculture into the fold, it’s taken her years to persuade anyone to make it happen. That changed in January 2024, when Riseling was invited to a LoProCO meeting, a program run by food advocacy group Nourish Colorado, which connects Colorado producers with businesses, schools and meal programs for older adults. The meeting was in Springfield, only 20 minutes west of Walsh, “so I thought, eh, I’ll go see what this is about,” Riseling said. “By the time I left I was bouncing, I was so excited. The next month I had a shareholder meeting, I was dancing all around. I made a slideshow, but the slideshow couldn’t keep up with me, I was just so excited.” What she saw at LoProCO was the opportunity to connect with Colorado farmers, to bring potatoes, peppers, meats, cheeses and leafy greens from their fields to her shelves, at a reasonable price. So far, Riseling has been able to score lettuce from The Summers House and ground beef from Bamber Ranch, a cattle ranch in neighboring Prowers County. Jaclyn Bamber-Birkelund, a fifth generation rancher, goes out of her way to deliver the ground beef from her family’s ranch to the Walsh store. They have their beef processed at Blue Ribbon in Fowler, east of Pueblo. Though the rest of her customers are along the Front Range, Bamber-Birkelund spends an extra day in the southeastern part of the state picking up beef from Fowler, driving it directly to Walsh, then crashing at her parents’ ranch in Prowers County, before heading back to Fowler for another batch, and running that to customers from Colorado Springs up to Thornton. “This is not normally a place that I come to very often, but it’s been really great,” Bamber-Birkelund said. “I love to hear from people that enjoy our product, and it’s a huge sense of pride for myself and my family.” Bamber-Birkelund is already on the hook to bring melons down from Rocky Ford when those are ready too, Riseling said. And if that doesn’t work, Riseling said she’s “talked to some folks to see if I can borrow their trucks.” Riseling started working for the store 13 years ago and worked her way into management in 2017, once she quit her job running the school lunch room. She keeps the store closely tied to the Walsh School District, which serves around 200 kids. When the lunchrooms in Vilas or Campo, nearby districts that serve around 50 students each, can’t get their hands on something, they also call her up. “(They’ll) call and say ‘Hey, I need this by this day,’ and I just say, ‘I got you,’” Riseling said. Riseling’s “got” a lot of people in town. When the nearest pharmacy stopped delivering to the nursing home because of COVID, the grocery store filled that role, bringing in medications from Kansas. “It just kind of stuck,” Riseling said. They set up an account with Western Union so locals can send money to family members in Mexico. They have delivery drivers bring groceries to elderly folks every Wednesday. “They know they can call on more than Wednesday, especially if the roads are icy,” Riseling said. She has personal numbers for most of them. If they miss a few days, she’ll call them to check in. Arguably the most important role that Riseling serves is as an unofficial matriarch in town. Beside her own three kids — the youngest worked at the store through high school — Riseling speaks cheerily about her “bonus kids,” those who have had a rough go one way or another and ended up in the Riseling living room. All three bonus kids worked at the store, too. Then there are the grocery store kids, mostly local high schoolers looking to make a summer buck and sharpen their business skills, like Elizabeth Garcia, a 16-year-old bagger. “I’ve learned so much, like how to manage money,” Garcia said. When asked what she does with her earnings, she said she’s saving it for college, a car and a house. Working has also helped her become better with people, “I’m less antisocial,” she said, nervously tugging at an armful of Mardi Gras beads she was handing out to customers. The student employees have to be decent workers, but more importantly to Riseling, they’ve got to keep good grades and listen to their parents. Anything below a C and she takes them off the schedule so they can focus on schoolwork. Riseling took her own daughter off the schedule once. “She had a D and wasn’t trying to get it brought up, so I took her off the schedule,” Riseling said, laughing. Riseling also turned to Nourish last year to set up the store with Double Up Food Bucks, a federal program that matches purchases made through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollar-for-dollar, to be spent on fresh fruits and vegetables, dried beans or seeds. If a SNAP recipient spends $10 on groceries, for instance, they automatically receive $10 to spend on produce. Before, the closest grocery store offering Double Up was in La Junta, two hours away. Shortly after introducing the program, one local woman approached Riseling crying in front of the store. “I was freaked out, of course,” Riseling said. The woman just wanted to express her gratitude that she could finally afford produce for herself and her disabled son. “Mimi, I got gapes! Mimi, I got nanas!” Riseling said, mimicking a young customer on another occasion, whose mother was able to buy her grapes and bananas. “Those kind of things are the reason I wanted to do that, I wanted to stretch SNAP for them,” Riseling said. LEFT: From left, Baca County Sheriff Aaron Shiplett, posse member Steve Sanchez and Deputy Lars Brahn observe Walsh Days festivities. RIGHT: Leon Bradley, left, and Kameron Wray observe Walsh Day festivities, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Walsh, Colorado. (Jeremy Sparig, Special to The Colorado Sun) SNAP is one of the programs in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” slated to see huge slashes in funding — the version in the Senate would punt the cost of SNAP benefits entirely to states. Though a version with major SNAP cuts was approved by the House, senators — many representing Republican states with large numbers of SNAP users — are sounding the alarm. Nourish was one of 19 organizations and politicians who sent a letter to Congress on June 13, expressing concern about the SNAP cuts, that included signatures from the Colorado Department of Agriculture, Colorado Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association and Gov. Jared Polis. More than 600,000 Coloradans receive SNAP benefits each month. In February, Rick Mills gave up his board seat, the last of the original five board members to do so. The meetings aren’t as packed as they once were, Mills said, and many of the board members stayed on for years because it was hard to find replacements. “But, you know, things in a small town, they change over time,” he said. For the first time in about 50 years, Mills isn’t on any town boards, a fact he mentions proudly and repeatedly. But he stays busy, with cattle at the commercial feed lot, with small business ventures, and with world travel. As much as he lights up talking about Machu Picchu — “that place was magic” — or Santiago, Chile, where he was detained by security for accidentally smuggling in a Slim Jim, he’s just as lit up talking about his single story home 4 miles outside of town, where he spends evenings soaking in the hot tub and watching the night sky. “It’s just real comforting to know that something like this worked, and that it keeps so many people at home,” Mills said. “When you go to another grocery store, you’re not going to save any money. You’re going to see so much more than what we carry here that you’re going to spend a lot more money. So it’s going to cost you more in the long run to go to a bigger town. We have everything we need here.” Walsh Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

June 17, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The global diabetic retinopathy market has shown a consistent growth in recent years and is expected to continue for the coming several years. According to a report, Grand View Research said that the global diabetic retinopathy market size was estimated at USD 9.48 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.4% from 2025 to 2030. One of the main factors expected to fuel market expansion is the growing incidence of diabetes in older individuals and the rising prevalence of blindness caused by diabetes. The introduction of novel diagnostic technologies and treatments and the increased awareness are driving the market expansion. The report said: “Diabetes is a globally prevalent health concern. It can result in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), which is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. DR leads to blurred vision and vision loss in most cases. International Diabetes Federation estimates that 1 in 8 adults will be living with diabetes in 2050. It also states urbanization, an aging population, decreasing physical activity, and the growing prevalence of obesity are some of the key aspects contributing to the rise in type 2 diabetes. DR is a serious microvascular complication of type I and type II diabetes. It is often caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage the blood vessels in the retina. It can progress to sight-threatening stages, which can cause blindness and visual impairment if not treated. According to a report published by the WHO, DR is responsible for 4.8% of the 37 million blindness cases in the world. The prevalence of this condition in the U.S. is expected to increase rapidly. Despite all the necessary measures adopted by the diabetic population, DR can lead to permanent blindness based on the disease stage and severity of the condition. Active healthcare/tech companies active in the markets include: Avant Technologies Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO), Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ: PODD), Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT). Grand View Research continued: “Individuals with diabetes are at risk for diabetes-related eye diseases, such as cataracts, DR, macular edema, and glaucoma. DR is one of the main causes of blindness in the U.S. The same organization also states that up to 21.0% of type 2 diabetes patients have DR at the time of their initial diabetes diagnosis. In addition, a majority of them may develop DR over time. This condition is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. According to the National Eye Institute (NEI), nearly 11 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have DR by 2030. According to a CDC analysis, early detection and treatment can prevent more than 90.0% of diabetes-related visual impairment. Intensive blood glucose management can reduce the risk of DR by 27.0%; therefore, the rising prevalence of blindness is expected to be one of the major drivers of the diabetic retinopathy industry… significant R&D expenditure and new launches driven by research-based product developments are anticipated to facilitate market expansion. Technological advancements and new product launches fuel market growth.” It added: “The global market is characterized by a high degree of innovation owing to rapid technological advancements and an increase in research and development activities. Prominent players in the market are involved in a moderate level of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activities, which can be attributed to factors such as the need to acquire new product development facilities, enhance capabilities, and expand product portfolios… In addition to meeting the growing demand, regional expansion provides companies with an opportunity to tap into previously untapped customer bases. This strategy enables them to strengthen their position in the market and increase their market shares.” Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) JV Partner, Ainnova, Begins Diabetic Retinopathy Screenings with Leading Pharmacies - Avant Technologies, Inc. (“Avant” or the “Company”) and its JV partner, Ainnova Tech, Inc., (Ainnova), a leading healthcare technology company focused on revolutionizing early disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI), today announced that screenings for diabetic retinopathy begin this week in collaboration with Grupo Dökka and its leading pharmacy subsidiaries, Fischel Pharmacies and La Bomba Pharmacies located in Central America. Both Fischel and La Bomba Pharmacies have asked their diabetic customers to schedule a free screening as part of a collaborative program where Ainnova will use its cutting-edge AI platform, Vision AI, to help identify changes in the retina using a quick and non-invasive scan of the patient’s retina. Vinicio Vargas, Chief Executive Officer at Ainnova and a member of the Board of Directors of Ai-nova Acquisition Corp., a joint venture company created by both Avant and Ainnova, said of the benefits for the collaboration, “As we begin similar initiatives in Mexico, our goal is to close the patient care loop with timely treatment—connecting every step of the journey. We are integrating pharma, retail, ophthalmologists, and our technology into a unified experience, all driven by one incentive: the well-being of the diabetic patient. Projects like this allow us to validate the model across diverse populations and sectors as part of our strategy to reach the market in a smarter, more efficient way—where the biggest winners are the patients.” Diabetic retinopathy is one of the main causes of vision loss in people with diabetes. Although, in its early stages, it may not present symptoms, it can be detected with a simple and quick screening.

(NASDAQ: TNDM), a leading insulin delivery and diabetes technology company, recently announced an agreement to develop and commercialize integrated diabetes solutions that combine Abbott's future dual glucose-ketone sensor with Tandem's innovative insulin delivery systems to provide more options for people to manage their diabetes. The Abbott sensor, currently under development, will combine glucose and ketone sensing technology that aims to help people living with diabetes detect early ketone rise to avoid life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. "Integrating our advanced insulin delivery systems with Abbott’s future glucose-ketone sensor has the potential to help empower people with diabetes to take faster, more informed action to protect their health and improve outcomes," said John Sheridan, president and chief executive officer. "We are excited to continue our partnership with Abbott and look forward to working with them to bring this new integration to customers in the future." Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) recently announced that it will advance subcutaneous and oral amycretin into phase 3 development in weight management based on completed clinical studies. The decision to advance subcutaneous and oral amycretin into phase 3 is based on feedback received from regulatory authorities following end-of-phase 2 interactions for subcutaneous and oral amycretin in weight management. “We are very pleased that the feedback from regulatory authorities has allowed us to take subcutaneous and oral amycretin in weight management to phase 3,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “We are excited about the amycretin molecule, and this marks an important step forward. We look forward to sharing more information on the design of the phase 3 programme.” Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ: PODD), the global leader in tubeless insulin pump technology, recently announced that the Omnipod® 5 App for iPhone is now compatible with the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System. With this latest integration, the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) System combines the benefits of tubeless AID and Dexcom’s latest diabetes management technology, all conveniently controlled from an iPhone. "This integration represents a major milestone in our commitment to providing innovative solutions for diabetes management," said Eric Benjamin, Insulet Executive Vice President, Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer. "With the addition of the Dexcom G7 sensor to the Omnipod 5 App for iPhone, our U.S. customers have more choice with fewer devices to keep track of, making it easier than ever to manage their diabetes." Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, recently announced MiniMed as the name for the planned New Diabetes Company following the intended separation. The name honors the company's roots, reflecting its original name prior to its acquisition by Medtronic in 2001, and a deep 40-year history of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care around the world. "Our journey began in 1983, when visionary entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann founded MiniMed and revolutionized diabetes care with many first-of-its-kind innovations that pushed the boundaries of care and helped simplify life with diabetes for countless people around the world," said Que Dallara, current EVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes and Chief Executive Officer designate of MiniMed. "We're thrilled to honor this rich 40-year legacy with a name that carries deep meaning and trust. As we step forward into this new and exciting chapter, we'll focus relentlessly on fulfilling our Mission to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest."

Title: The Trump family's licensing

Good morning! Add sequel fatigue among moviegoers to the growing list of things we can blame the Marvel Cinematic Universe for. At least, that's according to "28 Years Later" writer Alex Garland. In today's big story, the Trump family's plans for a new mobile phone company is the latest example of businesses tied to the president's last name. What's on deck Markets: How the Israel-Iran conflict could spell bad news for stocks. Tech: Inside the billion-dollar war over 'peace tech.' Business: Target's sales are struggling. BI reporters visited three stores to see what the biggest issues were. But first, can you hear me now? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Trump family just made a call on its next big business, and it's hoping you'll do the same. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump announced plans for a Trump-branded mobile phone service and smartphone, writes BI's Brent D. Griffiths. Dubbed Trump Mobile, it's a familiar business model in the world of Trump Inc. — a licensing agreement allowing for the use of the Trump name with plenty of nods to the president. The unlimited talk, text, and data plan is called the "47 plan" and will cost $47.45 a month, an homage to Donald Trump's run as the 47th and 45th US president. Meanwhile, the business' smartphone, the T1 Phone, will run you $499 when it's available in September and is gold colored (of course). Trump Mobile's website also touts the fact that the phone is made in America, an interesting distinction considering the questions swirling about the potential cost of a made-in-USA iPhone due to tariff concerns. Trump-branded services and products have existed for decades, but merchandise bearing the president's last name certainly hasn't slowed down in recent years. From sneakers to Bibles to cologne, Trump hasn't been shy about lending out the family name for the right price. There is one new twist to Trump's long-standing love of merchandising. Crypto has been a goldmine for the president and his family, including the sale of NFTs and memecoins. Now, Trump's media company is looking to dive deeper into the crypto world with the launch of a bitcoin and ether ETF, writes BI's Jennifer Sor. Trump Media filed documents with the SEC for approval of the ETF, which will aim to be 75% bitcoin and 25% ether. The news comes just a few weeks after the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing number of companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets. Launching an ETF is a bit more complicated and costly than just buying up bitcoin. One Morningstar analyst previously told BI an ETF costs around $200,000 a year to run. Trump Media's ETF also comes at a time when there has been an influx of famed investors and analysts, from Dan Ives to Nouriel "Dr. Doom" Roubini, pushing into the space. Trump still has more name recognition than just about anyone. But that doesn't guarantee success. After all, how people feel about the Trump name varies greatly. One early data point on the potential ETF isn't looking good. Following the announcement, Trump Media's stock finished the day down about 4%. 1. How the stock market could take flak from the Israel-Iran face-off. Flaring tensions in the Middle East could drag the S&P 500 down by 20%, RBC said. The bank named three ways that could happen: risk to valuations, impact on sentiment, and inflation driven by rising oil prices. 2. Billionaire trader Paul Tudor Jones sounds the alarm on AI. Although AI has great potential, Jones recently warned that the technology could spark mass unemployment and even eradicate the human race. He also said that AI should be regulated. 3. Is the Fed moving too slow? Markets predict more than a 99% chance the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but some economists worry that waiting to cut rates might be a mistake. They pointed to weakness in the labor market and tariff uncertainty as concerns. 1. Can AI predict — and prevent — war? The founders of the peace-tech startup Anadyr Horizon think it can, by creating AI versions of world leaders and seeing how they act in simulations. They hope Anadyr's software will help diplomats and politicians make better decisions in crisis and stop wars before they begin. 2. Meta's trying to fix its cringy feed. Meta AI app's public feed was full of personal information that looked to be accidentally published, BI's Katie Notopoulos writes. After BI's story and other media coverage, Meta has added a new warning message. 3. This SpaceX alumni-founded startup raised $10 million in 36 hours. AndrenaM makes software that analyzes sonar data to help spot undersea targets. "Our vision is to secure the oceans," its cofounder and former SpaceX engineer, Matej Cernosek, told BI. 1. Is Target struggling? BI went to find out. Target has had a tough time growing sales over the last two years while competitors Walmart and Costco have reported strong gains. The general state of Target's stores has been an issue for some analysts and customers on social media. BI recently visited three Target stores across the US: Here's what we saw. 2. Microsoft loves the word "Copilot," but a watchdog wants to fix that. Some customers and employees have been criticizing Microsoft's tendency to slap "Copilot" on everything AI. Now, the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division, an advertising watchdog, is weighing in — and they're not amused. 3. Ready or not, WhatsApp ads are here. A decade after Meta purchased WhatsApp, the tech giant announced it will begin showing ads in the messaging app's Updates tab, its own version of Instagram Stories. WhatsApp is also rolling out paid subscriptions for Channels. The moves are the most significant monetization push in WhatsApp's history.

Title: Welcome to Peak Palantir

The company that ” knows everything about you” is going from strength to strength as war rises and and the so-called “liberal” West turns into a dystopian novel. Amid all the controversy generated by Trump’s $45 million birthday military parade on Sunday, with some claiming it was a giant flop while others insist it was a roaring success despite the low turnout, one thing appears to have been largely overlooked: Silicon Valley’s role in part-bankrolling the event. As The Verge reports, while taxpayers footed the bill for the soldiers, tanks, and planes at the parade, several major tech firms helped pay for the “festivities” along the parade route. They included Oracle, Amazon, Coinbase, Meta, all with close ties to the Trump administration, and Palantir, Silicon Valley’s darkest unicorn which aspires to one day operate the US government’s common operating system. A number of blue-chip sponsors also pitched in, such as Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Coca-Cola, Walmart, BNY, Goldman Sachs and Exiger. However, it was Palantir’s logo that was beaming from video boards above President Trump’s head. With soft rock guitar solos playing in the background and tanks rolling past the cheap-looking stage, accompanied by patrols of robot dogs, the scene had all the glamour and style of a low-budget Hollywood sci-fi from the mid-1980s. If Trump was looking to project a message of power to the world, it was a spectacular failure. But there was still plenty of menace on display. Parade announcer: "Special thanks to our sponsor, Palantir" pic.twitter.com/OKcsaDUB7X — FactPost (@factpostnews) June 14, 2025 Palantir said in an emailed statement on Sunday that the company “proudly supported yesterday’s celebration of the Army’s” 250th anniversary “alongside some of America’s greatest companies.” Palantir Joins the Army Palantir’s star is rising rapidly under Trump 2.0 while its shares hit record highs on an almost daily basis. The firm’s co-founder and chair of the board, Peter Thiel, was one of relatively few Silicon Valley moguls to bankroll Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and now it looks like he’s cashing in. Thiel is also a former employer-cum-mentor of Vice President JD Vance, whose senate run in Ohio Thiel almost single handedly funded with a record breaking $15 million donation. In other words Thiel’s influence would probably be greater in a Vance administration. Palantir is involved in a new Pentagon initiative aimed at spurring innovation within the US army, titled Detachment 201. As Defense News reports, Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, was one of four Silicon Valley tech execs invited to join the US Army Reserve as lieutenant colonel, to help inject their speed and expertise into the army’s military innovation. The other three Army Reserve lieutenant colonels were from Meta, Open AI and Thinking Machines Lab. Granted, Silicon Valley has always been closely intertwined with the MIC and the CIA, with many big-tech firms, including Palantir, receiving seed funding from the CIA’s investment arm, In-Q-Tel. But in the case of Palantir, the connections run deeper. The company essentially began life as an unofficial spin-off from DARPA’s Total Information Awareness (TIA) Program, which was ostensibly shut down in late 2003 when Congress decided that building a comprehensive surveillance program for all US citizens was perhaps a tad excessive, even in the post 9/11 era. In reality, TIA would serve as the prototype for sweeping surveillance programs later developed by the NSA, and exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Meanwhile, Palantir was created, with CIA seed funding (like so many Silicon Valley firms), to be the privatised version of TIA. Now, its CTO has just enlisted in a new special corps within the US military. In an op-ed for the Free Press Project, Sankar notes that it would have been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the US military just a decade ago: Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite — much less to create a special corps so that they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government. But a sea change has taken place in both places because of the urgency and seriousness of the moment. Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific have focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization. Exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield. Our military has to change with it. As luck would have it, Palantir is a leading expert in exactly these kinds of technology. As leaked Los Angeles Police Department training documents revealed, its Gotham software collects and churns through huge reams of personal data, from gender, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots, surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos, scars, piercings and other identifying features. The company says its programs help users to spot hidden relationships and networks, uncover terrorist activity, and even predict attacks. The darker the world grows, the richer the pickings for this increasingly menacing (but still relatively little known) company. It wasn’t as if there weren’t warnings that this day — the day of peak Palantir — would come, even from some mainstream media outlets. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Bloomberg published an in-depth piece titled: The subheading: Peter Thiel’s data-mining company is using War on Terror tools to track American citizens. The scary thing? Palantir is desperate for new customers. A couple of paragraphs: Founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel and some fellow PayPal alumni, Palantir cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the CIA in Afghanistan and Iraq. The company’s engineers and products don’t do any spying themselves; they’re more like a spy’s brain, collecting and analyzing information that’s fed in from the hands, eyes, nose, and ears. The software combs through disparate data sources—financial documents, airline reservations, cellphone records, social media postings—and searches for connections that human analysts might miss. It then presents the linkages in colorful, easy-to-interpret graphics that look like spider webs. U.S. spies and special forces loved it immediately; they deployed Palantir to synthesize and sort the blizzard of battlefield intelligence. It helped planners avoid roadside bombs, track insurgents for assassination, even hunt down Osama bin Laden. The military success led to federal contracts on the civilian side. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services uses Palantir to detect Medicare fraud. The FBI uses it in criminal probes. The Department of Homeland Security deploys it to screen air travelers and keep tabs on immigrants. Police and sheriff’s departments in New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also used it, frequently ensnaring in the digital dragnet people who aren’t suspected of committing any crime. People and objects pop up on the Palantir screen inside boxes connected to other boxes by radiating lines labeled with the relationship: “Colleague of,” “Lives with,” “Operator of [cell number],” “Owner of [vehicle],” “Sibling of,” even “Lover of.” If the authorities have a picture, the rest is easy. Tapping databases of driver’s license and ID photos, law enforcement agencies can now identify more than half the population of U.S. adults. If Palantir knew everything about us in 2018, it presumably knows even more today, after purportedly participating in Elon Musk’s DOGE “clean-up” of government spending as well as an effort to build a new “mega API” for accessing Internal Revenue Service records. Palantir has also found new customers along the way, including an array of government departments, from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to NHS England, as well as banks, other tech firms, insurance providers, Wendy’s and a resurgent NATO. A company that aspires to be “in every missile (or drone)” and whose CEO, Alex Karp, openly brags about helping to kill “mainly terrorists”, has found fertile room for growth in both the US’ private healthcare industry and the UK’s publicly owned NHS. While two-thirds of its sales are still US-based, the company is rapidly expanding its overseas operations, particularly to the UK. As we noted a couple of months ago, the Trump and Starmer governments may differ wildly in terms of style, language and professed ideals, but they have some key things in common: Both are looking to transform their respective countries into AI powerhouses while also launching similar full-frontal assaults against basic democratic rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and the right to protest. Both have launched brutal crackdowns on protests against Israel’s genocide of Gaza (and both are now fully behind Netanyahu’s reckless war on Iran). A Leading Financial Indicator for Dystopia and War In fact, one would be hard pressed to find a more reliable financial indicator for dystopia and war in the collective West than Palantir Technologies’ company stock. Note how the graph has steepened in recent months. In May, as the wars escalated in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and as ICE intensified its raids against undocumented workers, Palantir was the S&P 500’s top-performing company. Since Trump 2.0 took over in late January, the company’s shares have almost doubled. In the past year alone, they are up 470%. To put that in perspective, the S&P’s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index has offered returns of just 40% over the same time period. Granted, Palantir has one of the highest P/E ratios on the planet, at 617. The P/E ratio compares a company’s share price with its earnings per share, and is often used to determine the relative value of a company’s share in side-by-side comparisons. The fact that investors are willing to invest so much in a company that is still earning so little, relatively speaking, suggests they see a bright future ahead for the AI-empowered surveillance and control technologies that Palantir specialises in. In other words, they are going long on war overseas and repression at home. Palantir was already receiving shovel loads of contracts from governments, particularly in the US, the UK and Israel, long before Trump returned to office. In February 2022, Palantir was hired by the Biden administration to manage Covid vaccine distribution. A year later, it was awarded a $447 million contract to develop a federated data platform for the National Health Service. It now has 24 contracts with UK public institutions including the Ministry of Defence, the Police Force, the Cabinet Office, and the DLUHC. However, as Kit Klarenberg details for the Gray Zone, Trump 2.0 has massively expanded Palantir’s work with the US’ government sector, using the company’s tech to break down information silos within government, making it easier for agencies to share data on US residents: On May 30th, the New York Times published a lengthy probe linking these deals to an executive order signed by Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry. The report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup thanks to sponsorship from the CIA’s venture capital wing, In-Q-Tel, which gifted Peter Thiel’s company $2 million in 2004. Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to target political foes. Nonetheless, the Times provided valuable insight into Palantir’s penetration of a vast array of US government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of “additional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.” In late May, the company’s existing contract with the Department of Defense was beefed up by $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping total award of $1.3 billion. Palantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known as Maven, which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration’s fondness for Palantir has placed its data analytics and storage tool Foundry in at least four federal agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies’ datasets. As we warned a couple of months ago, Palantir aspires to become the US and the UK governments’ central operating system by (in the words of its CTO, now a lieutenant colonel in the US army) expanding its “footprint across defence, healthcare and civilian agencies”: As outlandish as the idea may seem that one company could aspire to exclusively provide and manage a central operating system for the governments of both the US and the UK, there can be no doubting Palantir’s ambitions to expand its influence throughout government on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a company, after all, whose founder, Peter Thiel, has long marketed himself as a libertarian while lauding the benefits of monopoly capitalism and helping build the infrastructure of the modern surveillance state. As Iain Davis writes in his excellent two-part series on the “Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate”, the “proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Elon Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise”: Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. Good vs Evil One of the most bizarre aspects of Palantir’s rise to dominance is its unflinching belief in a Manichean world order, and that everything it does, including helping the Israeli army build kill lists for the Israeli forces’ genocide in Gaza and helping the US deport undocumented migrants, is for the side of good. Thiel and Karp seem to genuinely believe they are in the vanguard of a revolution in both technology and governance — one that will save Western civilisation from external threats while transforming it into something very different, something much darker. Even back in 2010, it was clear what side Palantir was really on: Palantir was hired by Bank of America in 2010 to target WikiLeaks. Their plan, later leaked to WikiLeaks, included hacking, disinformation and smearing supporters including @ggreenwald. pic.twitter.com/Y1p0DkI3ER — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 11, 2025 In March, the company launched a recruitment campaign on university campuses with black billboards inviting students to join their mission “to ensure America’s future”, closing off with the words: “we build to dominate”. “We are dedicating our company to the service of the West and the United States of America,” Karp said during an investors call in February. “[We are] here to disrupt and.. when it’s necessary to scare enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Karp also said that Palantir was “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”. Not everyone agrees. In the UK, for example, several senior officials at a number of NHS trusts have cautioned that Palantir’s technology was inferior to current systems, and could actually hamper NHS work. Palantir has always had an ace up its sleeve, however: the corrupting influence of revolving-door politics. In this sense, it is following the playbook of many of the blue-chip defence contractors it seeks to replace. As the FT reports, “Palantir is profiting from a ‘revolving door’ of executives and officials passing between the $264bn data intelligence company and high level positions in Washington and Westminster, creating an influence network who have guided its extraordinary growth.” Palantir is also active in one of the most secretive and influential forums of Western power politics: the Bilderberg Group. Thiel has long been a member of the group’s steering committee and was recently able to secure Karp a seat at the table. Granted, we will probably never know what was said at this year’s conflab, held last weekend at Stockholm’s Wallenberg-owned Grand Hotel, thanks to the private nature of the meeting and its use of the Chatham House Rule. But we do know what topics were under discussion thanks to a list provided by the organisers. They included the “transatlantic relationship”, “Ukraine”, “the US economy”, “depopulation and migration”, the “authoritarian axis”, and the Middle East, just a day after Israel launched an all-out offensive against Iran. This is a war that Palantir is also directly participating in, reports Klarenberg: For years, Palantir has been at the heart of US-led efforts to neutralize Iran’s alleged nuclear program. It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and US officials to visualize ties between the people, places and material involved in the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad. In a recent episode of System Update, Glenn Greenwald describes Palantir as having “an almost unprecedentedly influential role in America’s deep state and its intelligence apparatus and security state.” He notes how Karp* is becoming increasingly vocal about his belief system revealing himself to “be a hardcore neo-con, as devoted a loyalist to Israel as it gets,” and a firm believer in American war. Perhaps, just perhaps, Palantir’s coming out of the darkness in recent times will be its ultimate undoing. Otherwise, this may not be peak Palantir at all, but rather the beginning of its dominance of the government institutions and systems we partly all pay for. * While Greenwald focuses almost all his attention on Karp, describing him as the “sole controller and manager of Palantir,” he largely downplays the role of Palantir’s founder and current chair, Peter Thiel, describing it as “quite minimal”, which I believe is debatable. While Thiel no longer holds an executive role at Palantir, he is still chair of the board. It’s also worth bearing in mind that Thiel is one of the main shareholders of Rumble, the platform on which System Update is primarily hosted. For what it’s worth, JD Vance is also a major shareholder. This is a great article Nick, thank you. “Techno-feudalism.” “Techno-fascism.” “Authoritarian capitalism” (with a “techno” face). There are a lot of labels floating around for where we are headed. I wish the world of “dystopian” novels was not becoming reality so quickly. Thanks much for this. I’m not optimistic, but it’s much better to know what’s happening to us while it is still possible to obtain such information. I fear most of us are happily marching like lemmings into this world of infotainment soma, Brave New World style. But at some point the curtain to which Frank Zappa famously referred will be pulled back and we’ll be in 1984. The accelerating derangement of our political “leaders” makes me think that this could be soon, unless people wake up. That is one hell of an epilogue, or rather a punchline, in the footnote about Greenwald there. Just when you think you’re getting too cynical. Indeed. I have been watching some shows on Rumble so as not to give traffic to the evil tech overlords at Google/Alphabet. I didn’t realize Thiel was a shareholder at Rumble at all, and I do try to keep up. Thanks Nick for opening the aperture so people can peer through and see what the “future of the west” looks like from the perspective of the tech bro feudal lords. I, from my non-western perch, can only watch with mounting horror as the purveyors of death and mass surveillance sequester power at a rapid pace under Trump and his poodles Starmer, Metz et al. The shareholders of Palantir will make out like bandits as they continue their relentless assault on the liberties that westerners hold so dear while at the same time manufacturing external “enemies” around the world to justify the stock price. Scary stuff… Yes Nick, many thanks. Everyone is so focussed on the bad guys (Trump, Putin, Netanyahoo, Biden, ICE ……) they don’t realize what’s happening. I’m sharing this with liberal friends who marched against Trump over the weekend. I can only hope that the general public can shift its focus off of the NYT and onto the “real” news. One can hope. NC = real news. Thanks for this article. You wonder at what point that Palantir will change their name to the Umbrella Corporation. I get the impression that all this is predicated on more and more server farms opening up consuming energy and water like crazy so that all this work can get done. Of course in war time I think that they will find themselves vulnerable. In the meantime it looks like government are hiring them as hired guns who ask no questions. A country’s bureaucracy may question certain actions and may be examined in a public inquiry but a corporation like Palantir? Sorry, that privileged client-customer information. Our contract says that we cannot give you any answers – ever. Definitely if too many people start recognizing the name its time to change it Here is a very deep dive in Palantir and Military AI: https://www.projectcensored.org/silicon-valley-military-ai-weapons/ I’m not impressed with the gigo concerns in that linked article. Humans make tons of mistakes in war at all different levels of decision making, and enemies have been confusing each other forever. These AI and robot tools offer incredible war-fighting potential (incredible in the sense of effective killing and recon capability) and come with drawbacks, but obviously not sufficiently bad drawbacks to deter intense R&D. Putin awhile back said the Russians are treating AI as on par with nukes in terms of strategic impact. The US has a massive achilles heal because the gov’t tolerates a level of corruption that leads to massive military overspending and underperforming, which seems much less of a problem in Russia and china, relatively. But that’s a problem wholly independent of AI. Gifting top military rank to a bunch of nut-job Silicon Valley grifters — one of them born in Mumbai — on the eve of that Pyongyang-on-the-Potomac Army drag-show for Donny Bone-Spurs is simply more evidence of the Orwellian caste-based caudillismo into which America is sleep-walking. In the Panopticon to be run by the AI-educated minions of We Build to Dominate no one will be spared, even if you paid for one of their private club memberships. Karp’s murderous threat “to scare enemies and on occasion kill them” is nothing but a pseudo-intellectual beard on the End Times mentality of rationing and hoarding epitomized by Joseph Borrell’s notorious “most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden” quip. Tripoli, Raqqa, Bakhmut, Gaza, — next Tehran. Will your neighborhood be next? Man, so easy to unplug… Remember the 1990s, when nobody had a cellphone…? The lunatics have taken over the asylum, but can they build a new one to hold the rest of us? Palantir thinks so, but Palantir has been wrong rather often. Your email address will not be published.

Title: AppLovin Stock: Worth It At $365?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/17/applovin-stock-worth-it-at-365/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The AppLovin Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 20, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), a firm that assists mobile app developers in publishing and promoting their applications, has excelled over the past year, though it has experienced some ups and downs in 2025. While the stock dropped nearly 57% from the peaks observed in early February 2025 following a report from a short-seller claiming AppLovin violated service terms and exaggerated the success of its e-commerce operations, these claims have yet to be substantiated, and the stock saw a strong recovery after reporting solid earnings in the first quarter. The stock is currently approximately 7% up year-to-date in 2025 and has increased nearly 4.5x over the previous year. Demand for Axon 2.0, AppLovin’s exclusive machine learning algorithm for ad placement, has surged. The software effectively determines which ad to show, to which user, and at what time in order to optimize click-through rates or user engagement. While this resembles the strategies employed by Meta and Google, Axon is specifically designed for mobile app advertising. The company’s advertising platform reported impressive revenue growth of 71% year-over-year in Q1 2025, achieving $1.16 billion. Overall financial results have also been strong, with revenue soaring nearly 40% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA experiencing an increase close to 83%. Although the bulk of the company's revenue still comes from advertisements for mobile gaming applications, it is concentrating on expanding its e-commerce sector. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how effective this initiative will be, as AppLovin possesses an extensive dataset in gaming but may lack the comprehensive first-party e-commerce data that competitors like Meta and Alphabet have. That being said, despite its impressive growth and success, the AppLovin stock may be a challenging choice at its current price of approximately $360. We believe there is little reason for concern regarding APP stock, which makes it appealing, but it is also very responsive to negative events due to its elevated valuation. We reached this conclusion by comparing APP’s current valuation with its operational performance over the past few years, as well as its current and historical financial positions. Our evaluation of AppLovin according to key metrics such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. Nonetheless, if you are looking for potential with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns greater than 91% since its founding. Separately, see – Should You Buy CRWV Stock After A Whopping 4x Rise? Based on the amount you pay per dollar of sales or profit, APP stock appears to be very expensive relative to the overall market. • AppLovin has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.1 compared to a figure of 3.0 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio stands at 50.8 compared to 20.5 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.1 compared to the benchmark’s 26.4 AppLovin’s Revenues have substantially increased over the last few years. • AppLovin has experienced an average revenue growth rate of 23.2% over the last 3 years (versus an increase of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Its revenues have risen 41.6% from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion in the past 12 months (compared to a rise of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Moreover, its quarterly revenues increased by 40.3% to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter from $1.1 billion a year prior (versus a 4.8% increase for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s profit margins are significantly higher than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. • AppLovin's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.4 billion, indicating a significantly high Operating Margin of 46.5% (compared to 13.2% for the S&P 500) • AppLovin's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) for this period was $2.5 billion, indicating a significantly high OCF Margin of 49.4% (versus 14.9% for the S&P 500) • For the last four-quarter span, AppLovin’s Net Income was $1.9 billion - reflecting a significantly high Net Income Margin of 37.4% (compared to 11.6% for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s balance sheet appears solid. • AppLovin reported a Debt figure of $3.7 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $124 billion (as of 6/13/2025). This results in a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.9%(in contrast to 19.9% for the S&P 500). [Note: A low Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) constitutes $551 million of the $5.7 billion in Total Assets for AppLovin. This gives rise to a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 9.7% (in comparison to 13.8% for the S&P 500) APP stock has underperformed compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a smooth economic adjustment in the U.S., the potential consequences of another recession could be severe. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates the performance of key stocks during and after the last six market crashes. • APP stock declined 91.9% from a high of $114.85 on 11 November 2021 to $9.30 on 27 December 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely rebounded to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 September 2024 • Since then, the stock has risen to a maximum of $510.13 on 17 February 2025 and currently trades at around $360 • APP stock dropped 36.7% from a high of $88.22 on 17 June 2021 to $55.88 on 16 August 2021, in comparison to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis high by 14 October 2021 In conclusion, AppLovin’s performance across the parameters mentioned previously can be summarized as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Very Strong Therefore, despite its high valuation, the stock seems attractive yet volatile due to its poor downturn resilience.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) remains a titan in the technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing sectors, consistently shaping market trends through innovation and scale. As of June 17, 2025, AMZN’s stock has exhibited robust performance, driven by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, and operational efficiencies. This article provides a comprehensive financial analysis of AMZN’s recent market movements, key news driving its performance, a comparison with a correlated stock, insights into trading with inverse ETFs, and the role of AI-driven tools in navigating its volatility. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, AMZN stock surged by 6.75%, outpacing the broader market and reflecting strong investor confidence in Amazon’s growth trajectory. This momentum continued into mid-June, with the stock rising 1.57% on June 16, 2025, according to The Motley Fool. Amazon’s year-to-date performance has been remarkable, with shares rebounding 42% from a 52-week low of $151.76, fueled by record earnings projections for 2025 and 2026. For the first quarter of 2025, Amazon reported a 62% year-over-year increase in earnings per share (EPS), with net sales reaching $155.7 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, posted $29.3 billion in sales, up 17% year-over-year, though margins softened slightly to 39.5%. Operating income climbed 20% to $18.4 billion, surpassing estimates of $17.48 billion. Looking ahead, Amazon’s guidance for Q2 2025 projects net sales between $159 billion and $164 billion, representing approximately 9% growth at the midpoint, with operating income expected between $13 billion and $17.5 billion. The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted significantly, dropping from 90 in 2021 to 30 as of March 2025, while trading at 17 times operating cash flow, its lowest ever. This suggests AMZN may be undervalued relative to its growth potential, particularly given its 50% revenue growth and doubled operating margins since 2021. However, free cash flow declined 48% over the last twelve months, reflecting heavy capital expenditures, including a $100 billion+ investment planned for 2025, primarily in AI and AWS infrastructure. Several macroeconomic and company-specific developments have influenced AMZN’s stock movement as of June 17, 2025. On June 16, the broader market saw gains, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rising amid optimism over contained geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, boosting risk appetite. Amazon benefited from this sentiment, particularly due to its exposure to global trade. The company’s e-commerce operations, which account for nearly 40% of U.S. online sales, are poised to capitalize on easing trade tensions, as Amazon sells and facilitates imported goods. Additionally, Amazon’s partnership with Roku, announced on June 16, 2025, to create the “largest authenticated Connected TV (CTV) footprint” in the U.S. through Amazon Ads, drove a 10% surge in Roku’s stock and further bolstered AMZN’s advertising segment, which grew 18% year-over-year in Q1 2025. Amazon’s increasing reliance on AI to optimize operations, including robotics in its fulfillment network and custom silicon for AI workloads, has also garnered Wall Street attention, with analysts projecting new highs for AMZN in the second half of 2025. However, risks persist. High tariffs on Chinese imports, as noted by Zacks, could pressure Amazon’s retail margins, though the company’s diversified revenue streams—particularly AWS—mitigate this exposure. Softer-than-expected inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, reported on June 12, 2025, further supported growth stocks like AMZN, as lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for capital-intensive investments. Amazon’s stock performance is closely correlated with other mega-cap technology companies, particularly Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), due to their shared dominance in cloud computing and AI. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, MSFT gained 5.2%, trailing AMZN’s 6.75% increase, indicating Amazon’s stronger short-term momentum. Both companies benefit from the surging demand for AI infrastructure, with Microsoft’s Azure competing directly with AWS. However, Amazon’s broader exposure to e-commerce and advertising provides a diversified revenue base, giving it an edge in certain market conditions. While Microsoft’s cloud growth is robust, AWS’s projected 17-20% year-over-year growth and record-high margins of 39.5% in Q1 2025 underscore Amazon’s leadership in the cloud sector. Investors eyeing AMZN may find MSFT a complementary holding, but Amazon’s multi-sector presence makes it a more versatile growth play. For traders seeking to hedge or capitalize on AMZN’s volatility, inverse ETFs like the ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) offer a strategic tool. PSQ is designed to deliver daily inverse performance to the Nasdaq-100, which includes AMZN as a major holding. Given AMZN’s high correlation with the Nasdaq-100 (beta of approximately 1.2), PSQ provides a near-perfect anti-correlation, making it ideal for short-term strategies. When AMZN rallies, PSQ typically declines, and vice versa, allowing traders to profit from downward movements without shorting the stock directly. However, inverse ETFs carry higher risks due to daily rebalancing, which can lead to compounding losses in volatile markets. Traders must employ disciplined risk management, using tools like stop-loss orders, to mitigate these risks. Pairing AMZN with PSQ enables a balanced approach, capturing gains from bullish trends while hedging against potential corrections. The integration of AI into financial markets has transformed how investors approach stocks like AMZN. Advanced platforms leverage machine learning to analyze vast datasets, identifying patterns that human traders might miss. One such platform, led by CEO Sergey Savastiouk, utilizes Financial Learning Models (FLMs) to combine technical analysis with AI, offering precise entry and exit signals for high-liquidity stocks like AMZN. These tools, including user-friendly trading bots and Double Agents that detect both bullish and bearish signals, empower traders to navigate AMZN’s volatility with greater confidence. For instance, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for AMZN turned positive on June 6, 2025, signaling a bullish trend that AI-driven tools could have capitalized on. Such innovations highlight the growing role of AI in optimizing trading strategies. Amazon’s stock remains a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing. Its robust Q1 2025 performance, driven by AWS growth and operational efficiencies, positions it for further gains, though heavy capital expenditures and potential tariff pressures warrant caution. The company’s AI investments, including a 70% increase in in-house chip shipments projected for 2025, signal long-term growth potential. Traders can leverage AMZN’s momentum while using inverse ETFs like PSQ for hedging, supported by AI-driven tools to enhance decision-making. As market optimism grows with easing trade and geopolitical tensions, AMZN is well-positioned to lead the next phase of the tech bull market, potentially hitting new highs by year-end

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against Compass Diversified, Digimarc, Elevance, and West Pharmaceutical and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

June 16, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

Title: The Crypto Yield Hunger Games Ahead This Stablecoin Summer

ByChristopher Perkins ByChristopher Perkins, Contributor. Two people help themselves to slices from a pie decorated with a dollar sign, 1979. (Photo by ... More Alfred Gescheidt/Getty Images) Stablecoins are having a moment. This spring, a flurry of stablecoin activity has taken global financial markets by storm and captured mainstream attention. Investors rushed into Circle’s 20-25x oversubscribed initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in May, immediately tripling the share price of the second largest stablecoin issuer. With a market capitalization of nearly $250 billion, stablecoins are on the verge of breaking out of the niche cryptocurrency markets and into the mainstream. In the right interest rate environment, stablecoins are yield-generating machines. On the surface, they are almost the perfect financial product. A depositor pays a stablecoin issuer cash, the issuer places deposits in yield-bearing, high quality assets, like U.S. Treasury bills, and returns the depositor a tokenized version of the currency. While holders are typically not entitled to a share of the interest, stablecoins unlock inexpensive, global and around-the-clock payments and remittances. For those in the developing world, dollar stablecoins often serve as a better store of value than the hyper-inflationary local currency. According to the Chainalysis 2024 Geography of Crypto Report, the top 10 nations with rapidly increasing crypto usage (including stablecoins) includes India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan and Brazil. Nations with high inflation, like Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey, also rank in the top 20. In the crypto industry, skilled practitioners—and now AI agents—deploy stablecoins to optimize yield across an array of decentralized finance strategies. It feels like a modern day gold rush. Tether was the first stablecoin to really strike gold. In 2024, it reaped $13 billion in profit with only a handful of employees. With profitability like that, it’s no surprise that companies are about to pour into the space. Big banks, including J.P. Morgan, Citi and Well Fargo, are talking about teaming up to launch a joint stablecoin. Walmart and Amazon are considering stablecoins of their own. Even Meta, which folded its Libra stablecoin amidst a tirade of regulatory backlash, has considered re-entering the space. In fact, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified that he expects stablecoins to drive $2 trillion in U.S. treasury bill demand in the near future. Regulatory clarity makes institutional adoption possible. This week, the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, paving the way for stablecoin legislation. The bill requires reserves to be held in high-quality, liquid assets like Treasuries, imposes transparency requirements, and clarifies which institutions can issue dollar-backed digital tokens. However, it forbids any payment of interest to stablecoin holders. Traditional institutions, including the banks, have been waiting for this moment. At a Morgan Stanley conference in New York last week, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America said, “We're working with the industry, working individually.” For many issuers, however, there will be a downside to regulatory clarity. “But the problem before was it wasn't clear we were allowed to do it under the banking regulations, ” Moynihan said, driving that point home. One of the great lessons learned from the global financial crisis is that regulation forces consolidation. Derivative markets serve as a good example. When the Dodd Frank Act required the clearing of the $700 trillion derivatives market, many believed that there would be a proliferation of clearing members. Instead, the opposite happened, and clearing members declined from 177 in 2004 to 64 in 2024. With regulation, costs increased and intense competition compressed fees. Similar dynamics are likely to play out in the stablecoin industry. The truth is that stablecoins are highly sensitive to short-term interest rates. Interest income accounts for 99% of Circle’s revenue, and they project that a 1% drop in interest rates could wipe out $441 million. While markets suggest that there is little chance of an interest rate cut this month, the future is less certain. And, while issuers do not pay individual holders interest, that does not mean that they keep it. According to its financial statements, Circle paid over $1 billion in distribution and transaction costs—over 50% of its revenue—for the privilege of reaching Coinbase’s 89 million registered users. As the next wave of players enter the space, many arrive with existing distribution. Citi alone boasts 200 million accounts. Companies with large, coveted distribution networks will charge handsomely for that access. Or, they become stablecoin issuers themselves. Just like gold rushes of the past, “picks and shovels” stand to benefit. Infrastructure that unlocks distribution and scales issuance will be in high demand. Stablecoin exchanges and platforms that enable “vampire” yield attacks, where competitor stablecoins are accepted, redeemed and re-issued by a new issuer will be in vogue. Issuers will ask, “Why should they have the interest when it could be mine?” Decentralized finance protocols will benefit as well. Without yield, U.S. dollar stablecoins, which account for 99% of issuance, depreciate due to inflation. So, holders will continue to seek yield elsewhere. Tokenized money markets, which pay interest and are regulated as securities, could also see explosive growth. Stablecoin summer has finally arrived. As stablecoin panacea turns into the yield version of the “Hunger Games,” it will be a period of intense competition and quest for scale. So, to the issuers, may the odds forever be in your favor.

European shares made cautious gains on Monday, with Gucci-owner Kering leading the pack following a leadership change. The news helped to break a five-day losing streak as investors pivot from the conflict in the Middle East. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.4 per cent higher amid the developments. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session at 11,553.51, up 98.98 or 0.86 per cent on the previous close. It was a mixed day for the banks, Bank of Ireland rose 1.25 per cent to €12.115, and AIB Group increased its share price to €7.01, up 1.08 per cent. Despite these rises, Permanent TSB Group was a sectoral drag, falling 1.05 per cent to €1.88. Ryanair rose 1.85 per cent to €23.71, while fellow travel stock Irish Continental Group fell the furthest, down 1.50 per cent to €5.26. It was a good day for insulation and building materials specialist, Kingspan Group, who saw strong gains – rising 1.77 per cent to a share price of €77.45. Glanbia Plc fared well in trading on the day, ending up 1.04 per cent to €12.62, whereas Kerry Group fell €1.39 to €95.70. London London’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose on Monday, coming within spitting distance of a record high, after global risk appetite was boosted by reports Iran was seeking a truce with Israel. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed up 0.3 per centat 8,875.22 points, and came within a couple of points of its intraday record high of 8,908.74 points on March 3. The midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.5 per cent. Ladbrokes owner Entain jumped 15.3 per cent, the stock’s biggest percentage gain since September 2021, after its US sports-betting joint venture, BetMGM, raised its annual revenue and core earnings forecast. The travel and leisure subindex surged 3.3 per cent. In London, Metro Bank Holdings hit a more than two-year high and led gains on the midcap index after a report of takeover approach from private equity firm Pollen Street Capital. Shares of the British lender were up 18.4 per cent The precious metal miners’ subindex fell the most among sectors, down 3 per cent tracking lower gold prices. Europe European shares climbed on Monday, recouping some of last week’s losses as Kering soared after the luxury group announced a chief executive (CEO) change and investors shifted their focus from the conflict in the Middle East that drove a sell-off last week. On a sectoral basis, Heavyweight banks were the biggest boost, advancing 1.9 per cent Gucci parent Kering jumped 11.8 per cent, among the top percentage gainers on the STOXX after the luxury conglomerate said it was hiring Renault boss Luca de Meoas to be its new CEO, confirming reports from earlier in the day. Shares of the French automaker closed 8.7 per cent lower. A separate report said Tokyo’s Nissan planned to reduce its stake in Renault. On the downside, healthcare stocks lagged as Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk fell 3.5 per cent. New York US stock indexes had risen in midafternoon trading on Monday as oil prices fell after the Israel-Iran attacks left crude production and exports unaffected, allaying investor concerns in advance of a central bank policy meeting. Crude prices retreated more than 3 per cent on reports that Iran is seeking an end to hostilities with Israel, raising the possibility of a truce and easing fears of a disruption to crude supplies from the region. Oil prices surged more than 7 per cent on Friday after Israel began bombing Iran. Most megacap and growth stocks rose. Meta advanced after announcing on plans to roll out new WhatsApp updates over the next few months and Nvidia was also up. UPS and FedEx edged up after the Trump Organisation launched a self-branded mobile network, dubbed Trump Mobile, and named the companies as shipping partners. Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics plunged nearly half after the company disclosed a second case of a patient dying due to acute liver failure after receiving its gene therapy for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. US Steel rose significantly after Trump approved Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion (€12.8 billion) bid for the company. Cisco gained after Deutsche Bank upgraded the communications equipment maker to “buy” from “hold”.– Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: AMD stock surges 10%. Here's what sparked the rally

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged nearly 10% by midday Monday, adding more than $20 billion to its market cap and marking one of its biggest single-day jumps in over a year — thanks to well-timed AI hype. Days earlier, AMD gave Wall Street a detailed product roadmap, some actual hardware, and a few well-placed clues about who’s buying its tech. At its “Advancing AI” event in San Jose, California, AMD made it clear that it’s going after Nvidia. CEO Lisa Su rolled out the company’s next-gen Instinct MI350 accelerator chips and teased its coming “Helios” AI rack — an in-house server platform built to showcase AMD’s MI400 GPUs, which are due out in 2026. Su said Helios “will set a new benchmark for AI scalability.” AMD is also pivoting away from Nvidia’s closed-link architecture. Su said on Thursday, “The future of AI is not going to be built by any one company or in a closed ecosystem. It's going to be shaped by open collaboration across the industry.” The news out of California told Wall Street two things: AMD is closing its gap with Nvidia, and the company’s customers are real. One of those customers is OpenAI, which AMD confirmed is planning to use its next-gen chips and Helios platform. CEO Sam Altman spoke on stage with Su, remarking that initial specs for the MI400 were so ambitious he thought, “No way.” And major names such as Meta, Oracle, and xAI are already testing or deploying MI300X successors and supporting AMD’s modular approach. AI cloud provider Crusoe told Reuters that it’s planning to buy $400 million of AMD’s new chips. While Nvidia still dominates the AI training market, the recent news signals that AMD is carving out a credible second-place lane in the AI arms race — and that partners aren’t waiting to place orders. Wall Street liked what it saw. Piper Sandler upgraded AMD to “Overweight” status and boosted its price target to $140 (from $125). Analyst Harsh Kumar said in a note that AMD is expected to see “a snapback” in the fourth quarter as it works through most of its China-related charges and sees some of its product announcements as key to scale the company’s AI infrastructure. “Overall, we are enthused with the product launches at the AMD event this week, specifically the Helios rack, which we think is pivotal for AMD instinct growth,” he wrote. “We also note that the largest of the business units, namely client, is starting to see some pull-ins.” AMD is signaling it wants to be the “other” full-stack AI company. It has quietly acquired a string of startups — Eno, Brium, Untether AI — to build a more vertically integrated AI portfolio. AMD’s moves come at a critical time for the company, which has watched rival Nvidia’s stock rocket over 150% in the past year. While AMD’s stock performance has lagged, its fundamentals have been quietly improving — especially in data center sales — and its ability to show tangible AI progress just gave investors a fresh reason to believe.

Title: Sincerity Wins the War
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/sic/
Time Published: 2025-06-16T16:45:56Z
Full Content:
Hello Where’s Your Ed At Subscribers! I’ve started a premium version of this newsletter with a weekly Friday column where I go over the most meaningful news and give my views, which I guess is what you’d expect. Anyway, it’s $7 a month or $70 a year, and helps support the newsletter. I will continue to do my big free column too! Thanks. What wins the war is sincerity. What wins the war is accountability. And we do not have to buy into the inevitability of this movement. Nor do we have to cover it in the way it has always been covered. Why not mix emotion and honesty with business reporting? Why not pry apart the narrative as you tell the story rather than hoping the audience works it out? Forget “hanging them with their own rope” — describe what’s happening and hold these people accountable in the way you would be held accountable at your job. Your job is not to report “the facts” and let the readers work it out. To quote my buddy Kasey, if you're not reporting the context, you're not reporting the story. Facts without context aren’t really facts. Blandly repeating what an executive or politician says and thinking that appending it with “...said [person]” is sufficient to communicate their biases or intentions isn’t just irresponsible, it’s actively rejecting your position as a journalist. You don’t even have to say somebody is lying when they say they’re going to do something — but the word “allegedly” is powerful, reasonable and honest, and is an objective way of calling into question a narrative. Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago, multiple outlets reported that Meta would partner with Anduril, the military contractor founded by Palmer Luckey, the former founder of VR company Oculus whichMeta acquired in 2014, only to oust Luckey four years later for donating $10,000 to an anti-Hilary Clinton group. In 2024, Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, famous for saying that Facebook’s growth is necessary and good, even if it leads to bad things like cyberbullying and terror attacks, publicly apologized to Luckey. Now the circle is completing, with Luckey sort-of-returning to Meta to work with the company on some sort of helmet called “Eagle Eye.” One might think at this point the media would be a little more hesitant in how they cover anything Zuckerberg-related after he completely lied to them about the metaverse, and one would be wrong. The Washington Post reported that, and I quote: To aid the collaboration, Meta will draw on its hefty investments in AI models known as Llama and its virtual reality division, Reality Labs. The company has built several iterations of immersive headsets aimed at blending the physical and virtual worlds — a concept known as the metaverse. Are you fucking kidding me? The metaverse was a joke! It never existed! Meta bought a company that made VR headsets — a technology so old, they featured in an episode of Murder She Wrote — and an online game that could best be described as “Second Life, but sadder.” Here’s a piece from the Washington Post agreeing with me! The metaverse never really had a product of any kind, and lost tens of billions of dollars for no reason! Here’s a whole thing I wrote about it years ago! To still bring up the metaverse in the year of our lord 2025 is ridiculous! But even putting that aside… wait, Meta’s going to put its AI inside of this headset? Palmer Luckey claims that, according to the Post, this headset will be “combining an AI assistant with communications and other functions.” Llama? That assistant? You mean the one that it had to rig to cheat on LLM benchmarking tests? The one that will, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, participate in vivid and gratuitous sexual fantasies with children? The one using generative AI models that hallucinate, like every other LLM? That’s the one that you’re gonna put in the helmet for the military? How is the helmet going to do that exactly? What will an LLM — an inconsistent and unreliable generative AI system — do in a combat situation, and will a soldier trust it again after its first fuckup? Just to be clear, and I quote Palmer Luckey, the helmet that will feature an “ever-present companion who can operate systems, who can communicate with others, who you can off-load tasks onto … that is looking out for you with more eyes than you could ever look out for yourself right there right there in your helmet.” This is all going to be powered by Llama? Really? Are we all really going to accept that? Does nobody actually think about the words they’re writing down? Here’s the thing about military tech: the US DOD tends to be fairly conservative when it comes to the software it uses, and has high requirements for reliability and safety. I could talk about these for hours — from coding guidelines, to the ADA programming language, which was designed to be highly crash-resistant and powers everything from guided missiles to F-15 fighter jet — but suffice it to say that it’s highly doubtful that the military is going to rely on an LLM that hallucinates a significant portion of the time. To be clear, I’m not saying we have to reject every single announcement that comes along, but can we just for one second think critically about what it is we are writing down. We do not have to buy into every narrative, nor do we have to report it as if we do so. We do not have to accept anything based on the fact someone says it emphatically, or because they throw a number at us to make it sound respectable. Here’s another example. A few weeks ago, Axios had a miniature shitfit after Anthropic CEO said that “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years.” What data did Mr. Amodei use to make this point? Who knows! Axios simply accepted that he said something and wrote it down, because why think when you could write. This is extremely stupid! This is so unbelievably stupid that it makes me question the intelligence of literally anybody that quotes it! Dario Amodei provided no sourcing, no data, nothing other than a vibes-based fib specifically engineered to alarm hapless journalists. Amodei hasn’t done any kind of study or research. He’s just saying stuff, and that’s all it takes to get a headline when you’re the CEO of one of the top two big AI companies. It is, by the way, easy to cover this ethically, as proven by Allison Morrow of CNN, who, engaging her critical thinking, correctly stated that “Amodei didn’t cite any research or evidence for that 50% estimate,” that “Amodei is a salesman, and it’s in his interest to make his product appear inevitable and so powerful it’s scary,” and that “little of what Amodei told Axios was new, but it was calibrated to sound just outrageous enough to draw attention to Anthropic’s work.” Morrow’s work is compelling because it’s sincere, and is proof that there is absolutely nothing stopping mainstream press from covering this industry honestly. Instead, Business Insider (which just laid off a ton of people and lazily recommended their workers read books that don’t exist because they can’t even write their own emails without AI), Fortune, Mashable and many other outlets blandly covered a man’s completely made up figure as if it was fact. This isn’t a story. It is “guy said thing,” and “guy” happens to be “billionaire behind multi-billion dollar Large Language Model company,” and said company has made exactly jack shit as far as software that can actually replace workers. While there are absolutely some jobs being taken by AI, there is, to this point, little or no research that suggests that it’s happening at scale, mostly because Large Language Models don’t really do the things that you need them to do to take someone’s job at scale. Nor is it clear that those jobs were lost because AI — specifically genAI — can actually do them as well, or better, than a person, or because an imbecile CEO bought into the hype and decided to fire up the pink slip printer, and when those LLMs inevitably shit the bed, those people will be hired back. You know, like Klarna literally just had to. These scare tactics exist to do one thing: increase the value of companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, and anybody else outright lying about how “agents” will do our jobs, and to make it easier for the startups making these models to raise funds, kind-of how a pump-and-dump scammer will hype up a doomed penny stock by saying how it’s going to the moon, not disclosing that they themselves own a stake in the business. Let’s look at another example. A recent report from Oxford Economics talked about how entry-level workers were facing a job crisis, and vaguely mentioned in the preview of the report that “there are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates.” One might think the report says much more than that, and one would be wrong. On the very first page, it says that “there are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates.” On page 3, it claims that the “high adoption rate by information companies along with the sheer employment declines in [some roles] since 2022 suggested some displacement effect from AI…[and] digging deeper, the largest displacement seems to be entry-level jobs normally filled by recent graduates.” In fact, fuck it, take a look. That’s it! That’s the entire extent of its proof! The argument is that because companies are getting AI software and there’s employment declines, it must be AI. There you go! Case closed. This report has now been quoted as gospel. Axios claimed that Oxford Economics’ report provided “hard evidence” that “AI is displacing white-collar workers.” USA Today said that positions in computer and mathematical sciences have been the first affected as companies increasingly adopt artificial intelligence systems.” And Anthropic marketing intern/New York Times columnist Kevin Roose claimed that this was only the tip of the iceberg, because, and I shit you not, he had talked to some guys who said some stuff. No, really. Yet Roose’s most egregious bullshit came after he admitted that these don’t prove anything: That’s right, anecdotes don’t prove his point, but what if other anecdotes proved his point? Because Roose goes on to quote Amodei’s 50% quote, and say that they now claim its Claude Opus 4 model can “code for several hours without stopping,” a statement that Roose calls “a tantalizing possibility if you’re a company accustomed to paying six-figure engineer salaries for that kind of productivity” without thinking “does that mean the code is good?” or “what does it do for those hours?” Roose spends the rest of the article clearing his throat, adding that “even if AI doesn’t take all entry-level jobs right away” that “two trends concern [him],” namely that he worries companies are “turning to AI too early, before the tools are robust enough to handle full entry-level workloads,” and that executives believing that entry-level jobs are short-lived will “underinvest in job training, mentorship and other programs aimed at entry-level workers.” Kevin, have you ever considered checking whether that actually happens? Nah! Why would he? Kevin’s job is to be a greasy pawn of the AI industry and the markets at large. An interesting — and sincere! — version of this piece would’ve intelligently humoured the idea then attempted to actually prove it, and then failed because there is no proof that this is actually happening other than that which the media drums up. It’s the same craven, insincere crap we saw with the return to office “debate” which was far more about bosses pretending that the office was good than it was about productivity or any kind of work. I wrote about this almost every week for several years, and every single media outlet participated, on some level, in pushing a completely fictitious world where in-office work was “better” due to ‘serendipity,” that the boss was right, and that we all had to come back to the office. Did they check with the boss about how often they were in the office? Nope! Did they give equal weight to those who disagreed with management — namely those doing the actual work? No. But they did get really concerned about quiet quitting for some reason, even though it wasn’t real, because the bosses that don’t seem to actually do any work had demanded that it was. This is the same thing that happened when corporations were raising prices and the media steadfastly claimed that inflation had nothing to do with corporate greed (once again, CNN’s Allison Morrow was one of the few mainstream media reporters willing to just say “yeah corporations actually are raising prices and blaming it on inflation”), desperately clinging to whatever flimsy data might prove that corporations weren’t price gouging even as corporations talked about doing so publicly. It’s all so deeply insincere, and all so deeply ugly — a view from nowhere, one that seeks not to tell anyone anything other than that whatever the rich or powerful is worried or excited about is true, and that the evidence, no matter how flimsy, always points in the way they want it to. It’s lazy, brainless, and suggests either a complete rot in the top of editorial across the entire business and tech media or a consistent failure by writers to do basic journalism, and as forgiving I want to be, there are enough of these egregious issues that I have to begin asking if anybody is actually fucking trying. It’s the same thing every time the powerful have an idea — remote work is bad for companies and we must return to the office, the metaverse is here and we’re all gonna work in it, prices are higher and it’s due to inflation rather than anything else, AI is so powerful and strong and will take all of our jobs, or whatever it is — and that idea immediately become the media’s talking points. Real people in the real world, experiencing a different reality, watch as the media repeatedly tells them that their own experiences are wrong. Companies can raise their prices specifically to raise their profits, Meta can literally not make a metaverse, AI can do very little to actually automate your real job, and the media will still tell you to shut the fuck up and eat their truth-slop. You want an actual conspiracy theory? How about a real one: that the media works together with the rich and powerful to directly craft “the truth,” even if it runs contrary to reality. The Business Idiots that rule our economy — work-shy executives and investors with no real connection to any kind of actual production — are the true architects of what’s “real” in our world, and their demands are simple: “make the news read like we want it to.” Yet when I say “works together,” I don’t even mean that they get together in a big room and agree on what’s going to be said. Editors — and writers — eagerly await the chance to write something following a trend or a concept that their bosses (or other writers’ bosses) come up with and are ready to go. I don’t want to pillory too many people here, but go and look at who covered the metaverse, cryptocurrency, remote work, NFTs and now generative AI in gushing terms. Okay, but seriously, how is it every time with Casey and Kevin? The illuminati doesn’t need to exist. We don’t need to talk about the Bilderberg Group, or Skull and Bones, or reptilians, or wheel out David Icke and his turquoise shellsuit. The media has become more than willing to follow whatever it needs to once everybody agrees on the latest fad or campaign, to the point that they’ll repeat nonsensical claim after nonsensical claim. The cycle repeats because our society — and yes, our editorial class too — is controlled by people who don’t actually interact with it. They have beliefs that they want affirmed, ideas that they want spread, and they don’t even need to work that hard to do so, because the editorial rails are already in place to accept whatever the next big idea is. They’ve created editorial class structures to make sure writers will only write what’s assigned, pushing back on anything that steps too far out of everybody’s agreed-upon comfort zone. The “AI is going to eliminate half of white collar jobs” story is one that’s taken hold because it gets clicks and appeals to a fear that everyone, particularly those in the knowledge economy who have long enjoyed protection from automation, has. Nobody wants to be destitute. Nobody with six figures of college debt wants to be stood in a dole queue. It’s a sexy headline, one that scares the reader into clicking, and when you’re doing a half-assed job at covering a study, you can very easily just say “there’s evidence this is happening.” It’s scary. People are scared, and want to know more about the scary subject, so reporters keep covering it again and again, repeating a blatant lie sourced using flimsy data, pandering to those fears rather than addressing them with reality. It feels like the easiest way to push back on these stories is fairly simple: ask reporters to show the companies that have actually done this. No, I don’t mean “show me a company that did layoffs and claims they’re bringing in new efficiencies with AI.” I mean actually show me a company that has laid off, say, 10 people, and how those people have been replaced by AI. What does the AI do? How does it work? How do you quantify the work it’s replaced? How does it compare in quality? Surely with all these headlines there’s got to be one company that can show you, right? No, no, I really don’t mean “we’re saying this is the reason,” I mean show me the actual job replacement happening and how it works. We’re three years in and we’ve got headlines talking about AI replacing jobs. Where? Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal had a story from June 2024 that talked about freelance copy editors and concept artists being replaced by generative AI, but I can find no stories about companies replacing employees. To be clear, I am not advocating for this to happen. I am simply asking that the media, which seems obsessed with — even excited by — the prospect of imminent large-scale job loss, goes out and finds a business (not a freelancer who has lost work, not a company that has laid people off with a statement about AI) that has replaced workers with generative AI. They can’t, because it isn’t happening at scale, because generative AI does not have the capabilities that people like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman repeatedly act like they do, yet the media continues to prop up the story because they don’t have the basic fucking curiosity to learn about what they’re talking about. Hell, I’ll make it easier for you. Why don’t you find me the product, the actual thing, that can do someone’s job? Can you replace an accountant? No. A doctor? No. A writer? Not if you want good writing. An artist? Not if you want to actually copyright the artwork, and that’s before you get to how weird and soulless the art itself feels. Walk into your place of work tomorrow and look around you and start telling me how you would replace each and every person in there with the technology that exists today, not the imaginary stuff that Dario Amodei and Sam Altman want you to think about. Outside of coding — which, by the way, is not the majority of a software engineer’s fucking job, if you’d take the god damn time to actually talk to one! — what are the actual capabilities of a Large Language Model today? What can it actually do? You’re gonna say “it can do deep research,” by which you mean a product that doesn’t really work. What else? Generate videos that sometimes look okay? “Vibe code”? Bet you’re gonna say something about AI being used in the sciences to “discover new materials” which proved AI’s productivity benefits. Well, MIT announced that it has “no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data, and [has] no confidence in the validity of the research contained in the paper.” I’m not even being facetious: show me something! Show me something that actually matters. Show me the thing that will replace white collar workers — or even, honestly, “reduce the need for them.” Find me someone who said “with a tool like this I won’t need this many people” who actually fired them and then replaced them with the tool and the business keeps functioning. Then find me two or three more. Actually, make it ten, because this is apparently replacing half the white collar workforce. There are some answers, by the way. Generative AI has sped up transcription and translation, which are useful for quick references but can cause genuine legal risk. Generative AI-based video editing tools are gaining in popularity, though it’s unclear by how much. Seemingly every app that connects to generative AI can summarise a message. Software engineers using LLM tools — as I talked about on a recent episode of Better Offline — are finding some advantages, but LLMs are far from a panacea. Generative AI chatbots are driving people insane by providing them an endlessly-configurable pseudo-conversation too, though that’s less of a “use case” and more of a “text-based video game launched at scale without anybody thinking about what might happen.” Let’s be real: none of this is transformative. None of this is futuristic. It’s stuff we already do, done faster, though “faster” doesn’t mean better, or even that the task is done properly, and obviously, it doesn’t mean removing the human from the picture. Generative AI is best at, it seems, doing very specific things in a very generic way, none of which are truly life-changing. Yet that’s how the media discusses it. Seriously, put aside the money, the hype, the pressure, the media campaigns, the emotions you have, everything, and just focus on the product as it is today. What is it that generative AI does, today, for you? Don’t say “AI could” or “AI will,” tell me what “AI does.” Tell me what has changed about your life, your job, your friends’ jobs, or the world around you, other than that you heard a bunch of people got rich. Yet the media continually calls it “powerful AI.” Powerful how? Explain the power! What is the power? The word “powerful” is a marketing term that the media has adopted to describe something it doesn’t understand, along with the word “agent,” which means “autonomous AI that can do things for you” but is used, at this point, to describe any Large Language Model doing anything. But the intention is to frame these models as “powerful” and to use the term “agents” to make this technology seem bigger than it is, and the people that control those terms are the AI companies themselves. It’s at best lazy and at worst actively deceitful, a failure of modern journalism to successfully describe the moment outside of what they’re told to, or the “industry standards” they accept, such as “a Large Language Model is powerful and whatever Anthropic or OpenAI tells me is true.” It’s a disgrace, and I believe it either creates distrust in the media or drives people insane as they look at reality - where generative AI doesn’t really seem to be doing much - and get told something entirely different by the media. When I read a lot of modern journalism, I genuinely wonder what it is the reporter wants to convey. A thought? A narrative? A story? Some sort of regurgitated version of “the truth” as justified by what everybody else is writing and how your editor feels, or what the markets are currently interested in? What is it that writers want readers to come away with, exactly? It reminds me a lot of a term that Defector’s David Roth once used to describe CNN’s Chris Cilizza — “politics, noticed”: Whether Roth would agree or not, I believe that this paragraph applies to a great deal of modern journalism. Oh! Anthropic launched a new model! Delightful. What does it do? Oh they told me, great, I can write it down. It’s even better at coding now! Wow! Also, Anthropic’s CEO said something, which I will also write down. The end! I’ll be blunt: making no attempt to give actual context or scale or consideration to the larger meaning of the things said makes the purpose of journalism moot. Business and tech journalism has become “technology, noticed.” While there are forays out of this cul-de-sac of credulity — and exceptions at many mainstream outlets — there are so many more people who will simply hear that there’s a guy who said a thing, and that guy is rich and runs a company people respect, and thus that statement is now news to be reported without commentary or consideration. Much of this can be blamed on the editorial upper crust that continually refuses to let writers critique their subject matter, and wants to “play it safe” by basically doing what everybody else does. What’s crazy to me is that many of the problems with the AI bubble — as with the metaverse, as with the return to office, as with inflation and price gouging — are obvious if you actually use the things or participate in reality, but such things do not always fit with the editorial message. But honestly, there are plenty of writers who just don’t give a shit. They don’t really care to find out what AI can (or can’t) do. They’ve come to their conclusion (it’s powerful, inevitable, and already doing amazing things) and thus will write from that perspective. It’s actually pretty nefarious to continually refer to this stuff as “powerful,” because you know their public justification is how this stuff uses a bunch of GPUs, and you know their private justification is that they have never checked and don’t really care to. It’s much easier to follow the pack, because everybody “needs to cover AI” and AI stories, I assume, get clicks. That, and their bosses, who don’t really know anything other than that “AI will be big,” don’t want to see anything else. Why argue with the powerful? They have all the money. But even then…can you try using it? Or talking to people that use it? Not “AI experts” or “AI scientists,” but real people in the real world? Talk to some of those software engineers! Or I dunno, learn about LLMs yourself and try them out? Ultimately, a business or tech reporter should ask themselves: what is your job? Who do you serve? It’s perfectly fine to write relatively straightforward and positive stuff, but you have to be clear that that’s what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. And you know what, if all you want to do is report what a company does, fine! I have no problem with that, but at least report it truthfully. If you’re going to do an opinion piece suggesting that AI will take our jobs, at least live in reality, and put even the smallest amount of thought into what you’re saying and what it actually means. This isn’t even about opinion or ideology, this is basic fucking work. And it is fundamentally insincere. Is any of this what you truly believe? Do you know what you believe? I don’t mean this as a judgment or an attack — many people go through their whole lives with relatively flimsy reasons for the things they believe, especially in the case of commonly-held beliefs like “AI is going to be big” or “Meta is a successful company.” If I’m honest, I really don’t mind if you don’t agree with something I say, as long as you have a fundamentally-sound reason for doing so. My CoreWeave analysis may seem silly to some because its value has quadrupled — and that’s why I didn’t write that I believed the stock would crater, or really anything about the stock. Its success does not say much about the AI bubble other than it continues, and even if I am wrong, somehow, long term, at least I was wrong for reasons I could argue versus the general purpose sense that “AI is the biggest thing ever.” I understand formats can be constraining — many outlets demand an objective tone — but this is where words like “allegedly” come in. For example, The Wall Street Journal recently said that Sam Altman had claimed, in a leaked recording, that buying Jony Ive’s pre-product hardware startup would add “$1 trillion in market value” to OpenAI. As it stands, a reader — especially a Business Idiot — could be forgiven for thinking that OpenAI was now worth, or could be worth, over a trillion dollars, which is an egregious editorial failure. One could easily add that “...to this date, there have been no consumer hardware launches at this scale outside of major manufacturers like Apple and Google, and these companies had significantly larger research and development budgets and already-existent infrastructure relationships that OpenAI lacks.” Nothing about what I just said is opinion. Nothing about what I just said is an attack, or a sleight, and if you think it’s “undermining” the story, you yourself are not thinking objectively. These are all true statements, and are necessary to give the full context of the story. That, to me, is sincerity. Constrained by an entirely objective format, a reporter makes the effort to get across the context in which a story is happening, rather than just reporting exactly the story and what the company has said about it. By not including the context, you are, on some level, not being objective: you are saying that everything that’s happening here isn’t just possible, but rational, despite the ridiculous nature of Altman’s comment. Note that these are subjective statements. They are also the implication of simply stating that Sam Altman believes acquiring Jony Ive’s company will add $1 trillion dollars in value to OpenAI. By not saying how unlikely it is — again, without even saying the word “unlikely,” but allowing the audience to come to that conclusion by having the whole story — you give the audience the truth. It really is that simple. The problem, ultimately, is that everybody is aware that they’re being constantly conned, but they can’t always see where and why. Their news oscillates from aggressively dogmatic to a kind of sludge-like objectivity, and oftentimes feels entirely disconnected from their own experiences other than in the most tangential sense, giving them the feeling that their actual lives don’t really matter to the world at large. On top of that, the basic experience of interacting with technology, if not the world at large, kind of fucking sucks now. We go on Instagram or Facebook to see our friends and battle through a few ads and recommended content, we see things from days ago until we click stories, and we hammer past a few more ads to get a few glimpses of our friends. We log onto Microsoft Teams, it takes a few seconds to go through after each click, and then it asks why we’re not logged in, a thing that we don’t need to be able to do to make a video call. Our email accounts are clogged with legal spam — marketing missives, newsletters, summaries from news outlets, notifications from UPS that require us to log in, notifications that our data has been leaked, payment reminders, receipts, and even occasionally emails from real people. Google Search is broken, but then again, so is searching on basically any platform, be it our emails, workspaces or social networks. At scale, we as human beings are continually reminded that we do not matter, that any experiences of ours outside of what the news say makes us “different” or a “cynic,” that our pain points are only as relevant as those that match recent studies or reports, and that the people that actually matter are either the powerful or considered worthy of attention. News rarely feels like it appeals to the listener, reader or viewer, just an amorphous generalized “thing” of a person imagined in the mind of a Business Idiot. The news doesn’t feel the need to explain why AI is powerful, just that it is, in the same way that “we all knew” that being back in the office was better, even if there were far more people who disagreed than didn’t. As a result of all of these things, people are desperate for sincerity. They’re desperate to be talked to as human beings, their struggles validated, their pain points confronted and taken seriously. They’re desperate to have things explained to them with clarity, and to have it done by somebody who doesn’t feel chained by an outlet. This is something that right wing media caught onto and exploited, leading to the rise of Donald Trump and the obsession with creating the “Joe Rogan of the Left,” an inherently ridiculous position based on his own popularity with young men (which is questionable based on recent reports) and its total misunderstanding of what actually makes his kind of media popular. However you may feel about Rogan, what his show sells on is that he’s a kind of sincere, pliant and amicable oaf. He does not seem condescending or judgmental to his audience, because he himself sits, slack-jawed, saying “yeah I knew a guy who did that” and genuinely seems to like them. While you (as I do) may deeply dislike everything on that show, you can’t deny that they seem to at least enjoy themselves, or feel engaged and accepted. The same goes for Theo Von (real name: Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski III, and no, really!), whose whole affable doofus motif disarms guests and listeners. It works! And he’s got a whole machine that supports him, just like Rogan, money, real promotion, and real production value. They are given the bankroll and the resources to make a high-end production and a studio space and infrastructural support and then they get a bunch of marketing and social push too. There’s entire operations behind them, other than the literal stuff they do on the set, because, shocker, the audience actually wants to see them not have a boxed lunch with “THE THINGS TO BELIEVE” written on it by a management consultant. This is in no way a political statement, because my answer to this entire vacuous debate is to “give a diverse group of people that you agree with the beliefs of the actual promotional and financial backing and then let them create something with their honest-to-god friendships.” Bearing witness to actual love and solidarity is what will change the hearts of young people, not endless McKinsey gargoyles with multi-million-dollar budgets for “data.” I should be clear that this isn’t to say every single podcast should be in the format I suggest, but that if you want whatever “The Joe Rogan Of The Left” is, the answer is “a podcast with a big audience where the people like the person speaking and as a result are compelled by their message.” It isn’t even about politics, it’s that when you cram a bunch of fucking money into something it tends to get big, and if that thing you create is a big boring piece of shit that’s clearly built to be — and even signposted in the news as built to be — manipulative, it is in and of itself sickening. I’m gonna continue clearing my throat: the trick here is not to lean right, nor has it ever been. Find a group of people who are compelling, diverse and genuinely enjoy being around each other and shove a whole bunch of advertising dollars into it and give it good production values to make it big, and then watch in awe as suddenly lots of people see it and your message spreads. Put a fucking trans person in there — give Western Kabuki real money, for example — and watch as people suddenly get used to seeing a trans person because you intentionally chose to do so, but didn’t make it weird or get upset when they don’t immediately vote your way. Because guess what — what people are hurting for right now is actual, real sincerity. Everybody feels like something is wrong. The products they use every day are increasingly-broken, pumped full of generative AI features that literally get in the way of what they’re trying to do, which already was made more difficult because companies like Meta and Google intentionally make their products harder to use as a means of making more money. And, let’s be clear, people are well aware of the billions in profits that these companies make at the customer’s expense. They feel talked down to, tricked, conned, abused and abandoned, both parties’ representatives operating in terms almost as selfish as the markets that they also profit from. They read articles that blandly report illegal or fantastical things as permissible and rational and think, for a second, “am I wrong? Is this really the case? This doesn’t feel the case?” while somebody tells them that despite the fact that they have less money and said money doesn’t go as far, they’re actually experiencing the highest standard of living in history. Ultimately, regular people are repeatedly made to feel like they don’t matter. Their products are overstuffed with confusing menus, random microtransactions, the websites they read full of advertisements disguised as stories and actual advertisements built to trick them, their social networks intentionally separating them from the things they want to see. And when you feel like you don’t matter, you look to other human beings, and other human beings are terrified of sincerity. They’re terrified of saying they’re scared, they’re angry, they’re sad, they’re lonely, they’re hurting, they’re constantly on a fucking tightrope, every day feels like something weird or bad is going to happen either on the news (which for no reason other than it helps rich people constantly tries to scare them that AI will take their jobs), and they just want someone to talk to, but everybody else is fucking unwilling to let their guard down after a decade-plus of media that valorized snark and sarcasm, because the lesson they learned about being emotionally honest was that it’s weird or they’re too much or it’s feminine for guys or it’s too feminine for women. Of course people feel like shit, so of course they’re going to turn to media that feels like real people made it, and they’ll turn to the media they’ll see the easiest, such as that given to them by the algorithm, or that which they are made to see by advertisement, or, of course, word of mouth. And if you’re sending someone to listen to something, and someone describes it in terms that sound like they’re hanging out with a friend, you’d probably give it a shot. Outside of podcasting, people’s options for mainstream (and an alarming amount of industry) news are somewhere between “I’m smarter than you,” “something happened!” “sneering contempt,” “a trip to the principal’s office,” or “here’s who you should be mad at,” which I realize also describes the majority of the New York Times opinion page. While “normies” of whatever political alignment might want exactly the slop they get on TV, that slop is only slop because the people behind it believe that regular people will only accept the exact median person’s version of the world, even if they can’t really articulate it beyond “whatever is the least-threatening opinion” (or the opposite in Fox News’ case). Really, I don’t have a panacea for what ails media, but what I do know is that in my own life I have found great joy in sincerity and love. In the last year I have made — and will continue to make, as it’s my honour to — tremendous effort to get to know the people closest to me, to be there for them if I can, to try and understand them better and to be my authentic and honest self around them, and accept and encourage them doing the same. Doing so has improved my life significantly, made me a better, more confident and more loving person, and I can only hope I provide the same level of love and acceptance to them as they do to me. Even writing that paragraph I felt the urge to pare it back, for fear that someone would accuse me of being insincere, for “speaking in therapy language,” for “trying to sound like a hero,” not that I am doing so, but because there are far more people concerned with moderating how emotional and sincere there are than those willing to stop actual societal harms. I think it’s partly because people see emotions as weakness. I don’t agree. I have never felt stronger and more emboldened than I have as I feel more love and solidarity with my friends, a group that I try to expand at any time I can. I am bolder, stronger (both physically and mentally), and far happier, as these friendships have given me the confidence to be who I am, and I offer the same aggressive advocacy to my friends in being who they are as they do to me. None of what I am saying is a one-size-fits-all solution. There is so much room for smaller, more niche projects, and I both encourage and delight in them. There is also so much more attention that can be given to these niche projects, and things are only “niche” until they are given the time in the light to become otherwise. There is also so much more that can be done within the mainstream power structures, if only there is the boldness to do so. Objective reporting is necessary — crucial, in fact! — to democracy, but said objectivity cannot come at the cost of context, and every time it does so, the reader is failed and the truth is suffocated. And I don’t believe objective reporting should be separated from actual commentary. In fact, if someone is a reporter on a particular beat, their opinion is likely significantly more-informed than that of someone “objective” and “outside of the coverage,” based on stuff like “domain expertise.” The true solution, perhaps, is more solidarity and more sincerity. It’s media outlets that back up their workers, with editorial missions that aggressively fight those who would con their readers or abuse their writers, focusing on the incentives and power of those they’re discussing rather than whether or not “the markets” agree with their sentiment. In any case, the last 15+ years of the media has led to a flattening of journalism, constantly swerving toward whatever the next big trend is — the pivot to video, contorting content to “go viral” on social media, SEO, or whatever big coverage area (AI, for example) everybody is chasing instead of focusing on making good shit people love. Years later, social networks have effectively given up on sending traffic to news, and now Google’s AI summaries are ripping away large chunks of the traffic of major media outlets that decided the smartest way to do their jobs was “make content for machines to promote,” never thinking for a second that those who owned the machines were never to be trusted. Worse still, outlets have drained the voices from their reporters, punishing them for having opinions, ripping out anything that might resemble a personality from their writing to meet some sort of vague “editorial voice” despite readers and viewers again and again showing that they want to read the news from a human being not an outlet. I maintain that things can change for the better, and it starts with a fundamental acceptance that those running the vast majority of media outlets aren’t doing so for their readers’ benefit. Once that happens, we can rebuild around distinct voices, meaningful coverage and a sense of sincerity that the mainstream media seems to consider the enemy. Subscribe today. It's free. Please.

June 16, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) You’ve likely seen some extreme fluctuations in the stock markets recently. However, few have been as striking as CoreWeave’s (NASDAQ: CRWV) path since its IPO in late March. The cloud computing company’s stock has dramatically surged, soaring from $40 to $147 – a remarkable 3.6x return in just a few months. So what’s fueling this astronomical rise, and more importantly, is it sustainable? We’ll explore these questions. But, if you’re looking for potential profits with reduced volatility, the High Quality portfolio has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, yielding over 91% returns since its inception. Separately, check out – Will Adobe Stock See Higher Levels? CoreWeave is not your average cloud provider. While Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure provide a broad range of computing services, CoreWeave concentrates specifically on high-performance GPU-accelerated infrastructure tailored for AI and machine learning workloads. Consider them as the equipment rental service in a scenario where everyone suddenly requires advanced, specialized machinery without wanting to purchase it outright. Do they have clients? Microsoft, their largest customer, accounts for over 60% of their revenue. For organizations embarking on AI development, it makes complete sense to rent CoreWeave’s computing capabilities instead of committing tremendous capital expenditures for their own GPU farms or opting for a hybrid approach between purchasing and leasing. Why purchase when renting is an option, especially as technology evolves so quickly? However, it’s the numbers that make things intriguing—and somewhat concerning. CoreWeave operates 250,000 NVIDIA GPUs across 32 data centers. That sounds impressive until you find out that Microsoft allegedly owns 485,000 GPUs, and Meta is projected to have a staggering 1.3 million by year-end. CoreWeave is competing at high levels, but they’re still a relatively small player. The demand is so overwhelming that CoreWeave is aggressively expanding, resulting in significant debt levels. But here’s a crucial point: NVIDIA owns 7% of CoreWeave and maintains a solid partnership with them. The growth metrics are nearly unbelievable. CoreWeave’s revenue soared by 12,000% – increasing from just $16 million in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. The forecasts are astounding: $5 billion anticipated in 2025, with $12 billion predicted for the following year. This kind of expansion accounts for why investors are ready to pay 25 times the trailing twelve-month revenue for the stock. Yet interestingly, the average analyst price target is about half of the current market price, indicating that even the experts believe things might be getting somewhat overheated. Having Microsoft constitute 60% of your revenue is both a boon and a prospective drawback. If Microsoft chose to decrease its dependence on CoreWeave tomorrow, it could pose a serious issue. However, here’s the critical question – in today’s AI-driven market, would CoreWeave genuinely struggle to attract other clients? The demand for AI infrastructure is skyrocketing across sectors. From startups crafting the next ChatGPT competitor to established enterprises incorporating AI into their operations, everyone requires computing power. The more significant question may be whether CoreWeave can scale quickly enough to satisfy demand, rather than if demand exists in the short term. Indeed, aggressive growth comes with sacrifices. CoreWeave is depleting cash with a net income margin of -39%. They’re prioritizing expansion over profits, wagering that gaining market share today will lead to profits tomorrow. It’s a high-stakes endeavor that demands solid determination and substantial financial resources. The elevated debt required for acquiring more GPUs adds another layer of complexity. Yet if the revenue forecasts are accurate, this debt should become more manageable over time. In summary, CoreWeave is an intriguing example of timing and specialization. They’ve positioned themselves impeccably for the AI surge, but they’re also wagering heavily that this boom will persist. The stock’s sharp ascent mirrors both the potential and the risks embedded in this strategy. For investors, the concern isn’t whether AI infrastructure is critical – it undoubtedly is. The concern is whether CoreWeave can preserve its growth trajectory while navigating its risks, especially regarding client concentration and debt levels. And perhaps most crucially, whether the current valuation provides any margin for the inevitable bumps along the road. One thing’s for certain: CoreWeave’s narrative is far from concluded, and it’s set to be an intriguing journey for anyone daring enough to strap in at the present lofty valuations. Now, taming valuation contextually is just one of the many methods we utilize while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Social media has surged into the mainstream—and its most-successful creators aren’t just there for the likes. They’re entrepreneurs. The 50 richest on Forbes’ 2025 Top Creators list earned an estimated $853 million, an 18% increase from 2024’s record year. And that doesn’t include the millions they’re hauling in from brand partnerships. “Next year, it’s expected that influencer marketing will expand to $50 billion,” says Ryan Detert, founder and CEO of creator marketing firm Influential, who partnered with Forbes on our list. And with the rise of AI, content creation is set to accelerate, as advanced editing and targeting software allow influencers to produce videos cheaper, faster and better. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump watch fireworks following a parade to honor the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Washington. Missile strikes between Israel and Iran entered their fourth day Monday, and President Donald Trump is pushing for peace, having recently vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Trump did not offer specifics about the peace negotiations, later telling ABC News he was “open” to Russian President Vladimir Putin serving as a mediator and they had “a long talk about it.” Demonstrators crowded streets, parks and plazas for “No Kings” protests across the U.S. Saturday, and organizers say millions of people gathered to oppose the president’s agenda. In Washington, D.C. Saturday, rain muted the fanfare for the Army’s 250th anniversary and military parade, while TikTokers who’d reserved tickets with no intention of attending took credit for the parade’s “modest” attendance. Authorities arrested a 57-year-old suspected of killing Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and shooting State Senator John Hoffman in separate attacks early Saturday morning, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced late on Sunday. Walz called it a “politically motivated assassination,” and the suspected shooter had a list of up to 70 names, including abortion providers and advocates. Friday was the worst day in weeks for all three major stock indexes, as investors weighed geopolitical concerns in the aftermath of Israel’s strike on Iran, which subsequently launched counterstrikes. It was also the single-largest one-day boost in oil prices in more than three years, and the price of the traditional safe haven gold also shot up. “If Iranian oil production is significantly disrupted, oil has the potential to go much higher,” warned LPL Financial’s chief equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder. Brazil-based JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, where its stock price increased nearly 5% by the end of the day despite a history of corruption by its billionaire board directors Joesley and Wesley Batista. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the company and serve as board directors, saw their net worths rise with the IPO, and are now worth $4.8 billion each. Billionaires have the ability to indulge in almost anything, but a new Forbes survey asking the world’s richest about the luxury they can’t live without found that the most common answer was a private jet. The reason is primarily convenience: While flying commercial typically takes several hours, with all the security, boarding and taxiing, a private jet can be ready in minutes. Meta plans to acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion, supporting its sprawling AI ambitions. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg: Forbes has learned that Meta intends to pay Scale at least $450 million a year for five years for its AI products, or more than half of its annual AI spend, whichever is less. President Donald Trump acknowledged last week that his aggressive immigration crackdown is driving away long-time workers from the agricultural and hospitality industries, jobs such businesses are struggling to fill. Meanwhile, the Trump Organization has consistently utilized temporary visa programs to hire foreign workers for Mar-a-Lago, four golf clubs and his Virginia winery—even increasing its use of these visa programs in recent years. As the Trump Administration has targeted USAID for cuts, it is aiming to defund the agency’s inspector general’s office, which is tasked with rooting out fraud in foreign aid—and it saves taxpayers billions. The cuts have raised concerns among members of the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations and the Appropriations Committee, which oversees the agency. President Donald Trump’s pause on new appointments for J-1 visas had already thrown a wrench in medical residencies for foreign-born doctors, now a travel ban on individuals from 19 countries is complicating it further. Foreign-born international medical school graduates are a crucial part of solving the doctor shortage, but they must complete a U.S. residency before practicing medicine here. The Senate confirmed former Rep. Billy Long of Missouri as the next IRS commissioner in a vote along party lines, ending a contentious period at the agency. Long was confirmed despite the fact that he has no college degree or formal training in tax, law or accounting—and amid concerns about his ties to companies that promoted controversial tax credits. ILLUSTRATION BY SAMANTHA LEE FOR FORBES; IMAGES BY SIRJ_PO/GETTY IMAGES; BUBAONE/GETTY IMAGES; OXANA PLOTNIKOVA/GETTY IMAGES; VISHAL GHORI/GETTY IMAGES; BORTONIA/GETTY IMAGES Real estate entrepreneur Alexandre Rizk opened Las Vegas’ first cannabis-friendly hotel two years ago, believing he had a “genius, million-dollar idea.” It turned out to be a flop. Within five months of launching The Lexi on West Sahara Avenue, Rizk knew he had made a mistake as occupancy topped out at 30% and he started losing bids to host weddings and other group events to competitors who don’t cater to cannabis consumers. Rizk sold his first cannabis-friendly hotel in Phoenix and is in the process of rebranding The Lexi. After he stopped advertising the property as cannabis-friendly, occupancy jumped 15%. “Unfortunately, this venture could cost me my entire career,” says Rizk, who personally invested $5 million into the 64-room, adults-only hotel, which he bought with other investors for $12 million in 2022. Despite Rizk’s cautionary tale, Las Vegas is perpetually wrestling with how to integrate cannabis and casinos, particularly now that gaming revenue has declined this year. Nevada legalized medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2020, but thanks to federal law and Nevada gaming rules, casinos cannot invest in or be a part of the state-regulated marijuana trade without risking losing their gaming license. Nevada’s legislators have gone further and instituted rules that ban dispensaries within 1,500 feet from a licensed casino and forbids them from delivering legal orders on The Strip. In other words, doing business with the cannabis industry would be a death sentence for casino operators. WHY IT MATTERS Brendan Bussmann, the managing partner of B Global, a consulting firm focused on gaming and hospitality, says Las Vegas’ greatest skill is its ability to offer entertainment to the masses, but that the anything-goes debauchery Sin City is famous for is like a David Copperfield show—largely an illusion. “Yes, you can have gaming here, and yes, you can have fun in a host of different ways,” says Bussmann, “but we’re not here to say there are no rules.” MORE The Inside Story Of Las Vegas’ First Cannabis-Friendly Hotel Coco Gauff is one of the world’s highest-paid tennis players, but the more than $2.9 million she earned from winning the French Open will be slashed nearly in half after paying required taxes.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: What The Cyberattack On UNFI Reveals About The U.S. Grocery Industry

ByErrol Schweizer ByErrol Schweizer, Contributor. Empty shelves at a Texas Whole Foods store. A cyberattack on June 5 crippled United Natural Foods (UNFI), a $30 billion grocery wholesaler and Whole Foods Market’s largest supplier. UNFI also services more than 15,000 other supermarkets, cooperatives, health food stores and chain stores, and the company not yet sure when its ordering and replenishment systems will be able to fully supply its retail customers. Grocers have scrambled to access products from other wholesalers, putting pressure on supply chains throughout the industry. While the cyberattack earned headlines for how it affected shoppers and store operations, the disruption also highlights the role of wholesalers in ensuring a functional U.S. food industry: When a wholesaler like UNFI sneezes, the grocery industry catches a cold. Wholesalers are the vital connection between producers, manufacturers and retailers, and they command significant market access while working hand-in-glove with grocers on a daily basis. Though many retailers still do some of their own wholesale distribution, third parties like UNFI are essential to feeding many Americans. Wholesalers handle millions of cases of product per day. They are large, complex, fast-paced work environments. They have very thin margins. UNFI gross margins typically hovers around 13.5%, a fraction of what retailers and manufacturers run on. Besides UNFI, major wholesalers include $23 billion C&S, which supplies thousands of independent and chain-store supermarkets on the East coast of the U.S., and $50 billion McLane, wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway and a major supplier to Walmart and Wawa. Others include Spartan Nash, partially owned by Amazon, and UNFI rival KeHe, an employee owned behemoth that services Sprouts, HEB, and thousands of independent natural foods and specialty food stores. These wholesalers supply more than $300 billion a year in retail value, yet they are mostly invisible to consumers. Wholesalers like UNFI and KeHe typically have primary relationships with grocers like Whole Foods and Sprouts, in that they distribute the lion’s share of their center store, beverage, dairy and frozen packaged food products. Grocers sometimes also use direct service snack and beverage operators like Frito-Lay, Pepsi, Snyder’s, Rainforest, and Dora’s Natural, or family owned specialty distributors like Chex Foods, as well as new item innovation focused start-ups like Pod Foods to diversify their supplier base. But the vast rows of empty shelves at Whole Foods and other stores illustrate the reach that primary wholesalers like UNFI have with their retail partners. The retailers typically dictate what the wholesaler sells to them, based on their contractual obligations, their category management strategies, new product launches, private label programs and overall assortment blend by store, region and enterprise — all of which is usually specific to each wholesale warehouse location. The wholesaler in turn controls much of the market access for the thousands of brands and suppliers approved by retail buyers to sell into their stores. In exchange for a low cost-plus markup, the retailer requires most of its suppliers to go through the wholesaler and drive large sales volumes, therefore justifying the low markup. The wholesaler typically guarantees product placement, inventory prioritization and better delivery schedules for its primary customers, especially during weather-related events or other disruptions. This relationship consolidates product distribution, creating a monopoly on supplying products into the grocer’s packaged food and beverage departments. UNFI truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. Wholesalers also tend to manage day to day relationships with suppliers on a more hands-on basis than grocers. When retailers approve placement of a product line in their stores, brands see it as a triumph that they got into the grocer. But this is really just the beginning. They must now keep the grocer happy and fulfill their promotional and inventory commitments and achieve sales and velocity hurdles to stay on shelf. They must also stay on the good side of their wholesale buyers. The wholesaler needs to make a profit and has its own margin model, marketing programs, fees and assorted expenses that suppliers must cover from its gross margin and trade and marketing spends. The markups wholesalers charge retailers are typically well below their cost of doing business. Retailers are under enormous pressure to compete with Walmart, discounters and dollar stores that are growing in market share and siphoning customers away. UNFI’s gross margin is usually in the 13-14% range. Their contractual markup to their largest customer, Whole Foods, is in the 6-7% range and even lower for Whole Foods’ store brand products. On the surface, this means UNFI is losing 6-7 points for every case of product it sends to Whole Foods. UNFI must cover this spread in one of two ways in order to stay operational and earn a profit to keep shareholders happy. One way is by charging disproportionately higher markups to smaller independent retailers who are not part of an advantageous agreement that would bring their markups down. Such one-off independent stores sometimes pay 20-30% markups on the same items that a cost-plus retailer with larger scale pays 6-10% for. It behooves independents to join together and negotiate cooperative cost-plus agreements with wholesalers. Otherwise, it could mean that the retail prices at chain stores such as Kroger or Walmart could be lower than the wholesale cost that an independent grocer is paying, even before they add on their own retail markups. Such revenue streams include strict payment terms, such as a 60 day non-payment window when a product line is launched into retailers, as well as free fills and slotting fees, and various promotional discount models that suppliers must fund, such as MCBs (manufacturer charge backs), Off-Invoice discounts, as well as forward buys and bridge buys, where inventory is bought during discount periods and held to sell at regular prices after discounts periods are over. And then there is a range of obscure, confusing and frustrating accounting and payment practices to suppliers, such as invoice deductions, upcharges and billbacks for unsold, lost or damaged products, or outsourced labor fees for moving products around or between warehouses, called lumper fees. These are all major inside revenue streams for wholesalers that cover the spread between cost-plus markups and their gross margins, and are not discussed on earnings calls or CNBC segments. More empty shelves at Whole Foods. MCBs are a discount structure taken off the inbound cost of the product once it hits the wholesaler’s dock. Unlike off-invoice (OI) discounts, which transparently flow from supplier to wholesaler and on to the retailer and the end consumer, the MCB is billed back to the supplier at an additional retail markup, called the full-wholesale price. On paper, this inflates the cost of the supplier’s product, thereby also inflating the value of the discount that the wholesaler can grab and the supplier must pay, essentially applying a markup on the markdown. A supplier taking 20% off their list cost could end up being billed back for 35-40% of the cost of their product. Many retailers, such as Whole Foods and Sprouts, have gotten wise to MCB practices. But instead of disallowing such markups on supplier markdowns, they just contractually require wholesalers to rebate a portion of their cut back to the retailers, called a true-up. Most items on sale at grocers that pull from UNFI or KeHe are funded by MCB monies. But many suppliers actually prefer the MCB discounts because OI discounts can be worse. Wholesalers and retailers can require suppliers to do regular OI-funded promotions, because they discount the value of the inventory sent to retailers and the accounting is easier. But OI discounts can mean that wholesalers can forward buy large amounts of product on discount just as a sale period is ending, allowing them to sell much of it at a regular price at much higher margins. Or the wholesaler can bridge buy between promotional periods, loading up on enough inventory at the end of one sale period to carry through until the next sales period a few weeks or months down the line, so they never have to buy products at regular cost from suppliers, eating into supplier margins, and all the while selling the products to retailers at a higher margin and not reflecting the discounted inventory to their retail customers or end consumers in the form of in-store sale prices. When a supplier is covering the wholesaler’s bridge buy or forward buy, on top of funding aggressive promotions, such as the BOGO (buy one, get one) offers heavily marketed at Sprouts, it can be devastating to their business. And suppliers will see little to no return on investment on these trade dollars, unless they count not running afoul of their wholesalers as a good use of funds. Fear is also currency. And eventually, this fear translates into higher costs for consumers, as suppliers can only squeeze so much out of their margins before they pass those costs on down the line to consumers, or they can go out of business. In the 19th century, Joseph Schumpeter heralded capitalism as creative destruction. He had no idea how creative that destruction could get. There are plenty of other common wholesaler practices that suppliers, especially independent and family-owned emerging brands, deal with regularly: being charged the same fees twice; being paid late and receiving early payment deductions in spite of this; systematically being withheld payment; paying warehouse activation fees or listing fees/discounts that are not contractually required; getting billed for monthly specials and flyer programs they did not agree to pay for; erroneous deductions with no backups to review, sometimes for thousands of dollars at a time; vague and confusing deduction and billback documentation for shrink or damages; being billed for out of temp product the wholesaler sent to a retailer, especially when the retailers refuse product and send it back to the wholesaler; being billed for free fills and slotting even when retailers have waived such fees; and paying for a highly essential cottage industry of forensic accountants who specialize in billback and deduction audits, dispute resolution and chasing refunds, some of whom are even familial relations to former executives at the very same wholesalers. Such practices have become more commonplace as the wholesaler marketplace has further consolidated into fewer and larger enterprises, such as UNFI’s acquisition of SuperValu, which in turn was encouraged by investors spooked by Amazon buying up UNFI’s largest customer, Whole Foods. Scale begets scale. Suppliers have little say in these matters, except for the occasional eruption of bad PR that is quickly quelled by wholesalers’ supplier relations staff. Retailers are contractually obligated to push suppliers into their primary wholesalers in order to reap the rewards of cost-plus agreements that shave 5-10% in savings on wholesale costs. This savings is material to their pricing strategy, customer retention and profitability. And by controlling market access to select, high profile retailers, wholesalers can make the rules and charge brands whatever this constricted market will bear. And it bears a lot. Empty shelves at Whole Foods. There are few alternatives that can offer the broad range of goods at the low costs retailers are demanding to stay price competitive, especially as climate and trade war inflationary pressures are pushing up costs on key goods like coffee, cocoa, beef, European specialties, imported produce and packaging materials like steel and aluminum. Wholesalers like UNFI and KeHe have swallowed up many independent and cooperative competitors, and wholesale is now one of the most consolidated sectors of the food industry. Some retailers, like HEB and Kroger, still self-distribute high volume packaged food products or have internalized wholesaler operations, such as Stop & Shop and Giant’s parent company Ahold-Delhaize. Some lean on higher cost but more customer-service oriented wholesale operators that provide essential services, such as importation, product sourcing, private labeling, category management and in-store sales and merchandising support. And many retailers have banded together to form wholesale cooperatives that leverage collective scale to access products at competitive prices, such as the Greater Austin Merchants Association, Associated Wholesale Grocers or Twin Cities Co-op Partners. Wakefern, based in New Jersey, is the largest such cooperative, with nearly $20 billion in annual sales via hundreds of independent owner-operated stores such as Fairway and ShopRite. The New York City metro area is uniquely abundant with a number of independent and cooperative wholesale and retail operators. But most U.S. metro areas are not so lucky, dominated not only by a handful of large grocery chains such as Walmart, Costco, Kroger and Albertsons, but also lacking in a diverse array of wholesalers that can supply the wide range of packaged foods that they sell every day. Scale begets scale; market concentration is a self-fulfilling prophecy. And since market concentration also means pricing power, the costs of doing business are passed onto farmers, food workers, small businesses, emerging food brands and cash-strapped consumers, in the form of wage stagnation, higher food prices and draconian fees and invoice deductions. UNFI, after all, is still accountable to its institutional investors and shareholders, who want to see ongoing, profitable growth, no matter what. If grocery market consolidation had a mascot, it would be Robin Hood in reverse. So while UNFI will hopefully recover quickly from the cyberattack and adopt better cyber security measures to ensure that millions of consumers have access to the food the eat everyday, the grocery industry lives with an ongoing structural dilemma. In an era of cybercrime, trade wars, climate change, pandemics and social upheaval, is a consolidated and opaque wholesale grocery sector the best way to stock grocery shelves and keep America fed? We won’t have long to wait for an answer. The next supply chain crisis is only a matter of time.

Title: Bitcoin Suddenly Braced For A Crypto Price Game-Changer— Predicted To ‘Unleash’ Trillions

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/16 update below. This post was originally published on June 15 Bitcoin and crypto have surged this year as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration will further boost the bitcoin price (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a surprise crypto market prediction). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has traded above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May after rebounding from Trump’s tariff-induced slump as rumors swirl of a looming, “extraordinary” White House update. Now, as traders await an imminent Federal Reserve bombshell, the U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the Trump administration’s landmark stablecoin bill, with Trump promising it will lead to the U.S. “dominating” bitcoin and crypto and expected to open up the crypto market to “trillions of tokenized dollars." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has made it a priority of his administration to get stablecoin ... More legislation passed, something that's helped support the bitcoin price and crypto market in recent months. This week, the U.S. Senate voted 68 to 30 to move forward the so-called Genius Act that would regulate stablecoins, setting the bipartisan bill up for a final vote that’s scheduled for Tuesday, June 17. 06/16 update: Amazon and Walmart are among some of the biggest companies weighing whether to launch their own stablecoins or forge partnership with stablecoin companies, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous sources. Travel company Expedia and unnamed airlines were also said to be considering creating their own stablecoins to ease the cost and speed of transactions as a result of stablecoin legislation that’s expected to be passed by U.S. lawmakers. If individual companies decide they'd prefer to launch their own stablecoins rather than use those issued by the likes of Tether and Circle or use those in development by Wall Street banks, it could disrupt the entire financial system, starting with the companies who make the most from processing fees: Visa and Mastercard. In May, a report revealed Mark Zuckerberg is planning to add crypto support for Meta’s 3 billion global users. Meta is "in discussions with crypto firms to introduce stablecoins as a means to manage payouts," Fortune reported, citing anonymous sources. Meta, which runs the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms and is developing a shared virtual reality it calls the metaverse, is still licking its wounds from its failed attempt to upend the global financial system with its libra-diem crypto-inspired currency that was torpedoed by regulators in 2019. “The version of the Genius Act that we will invoke cloture on today reflects months of hard work and negotiations from members on both sides of the aisle,” Republican majority leader John Thune said in comments reported by Politico, adding, "it’s time to move forward and pass this legislation." If sent onto Trump’s desk for his signature, the Genius Act would provide a legal and regulatory framework for stablecoins—a form of bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency that’s usually pegged to the U.S. dollar and used to move money around the world more quickly and cheaply than traditional payment rails. "This clarity could unlock trillions in financial and payment rails innovation," Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex Asset Management, said in emailed comments, and pointing to stablecoin transaction volume that has recently surpassed Visa and Mastercard. “A finalized framework [for stablecoin legislation] in the U.S. could unleash a new wave of institutional adoption and product innovation, possibly bringing trillions of tokenized dollars to the market in the years to come.” The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world’s biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants this year scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent echoed a report from analysts with Standard Chartered Bank this week when he predicted U.S. stablecoin legislation would boost the market 10-fold to around $2 trillion. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump said he’s proud to be considered the first “crypto president” during a pre-recorded address to Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, telling attendees that after passing the Genius Act stablecoin legislation he wants to create a “clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin.” Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year, following through on his campaign promise to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve via an executive order in March and also launching his own memecoin and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin via his family’s World Liberty Financial project. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, topping $100,000 as U.S. president Donald Trump ... More embraces crypto and sparking a flurry of bullish bitcoin price predictions. Trump’s growing ties to crypto, which Forbes found has added around $1 billion to his personal wealth, has been used by Democratic Party lawmakers to campaign against the Genius Act, with Democratic representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland warning last month that Trump’s crypto ventures offered the “perfect opportunity for foreign government, corporate and individual funds to be funneled into Donald Trump’s bank account and his family’s finances.” Bitcoin and crypto traders expecting clarity on stablecoin regulation has helped support the bitcoin price in recent months that’s been rocked along with stock markets by trade tensions. “Bitcoin appears to be consolidating above $100,000,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments, pointing to the settling market turmoil caused by Trump’s global trade war. “Recent moves to strengthen regulation across stablecoins have also helped.”

Title: Single-Stock ETF Market Swells With Firehose of New Products

Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the single-stock ETF. While the number of leveraged single-stock ETFs in the US more than doubled in the first four months of the year, things may just be getting started. In the past few weeks alone, dozens of such products have been filed for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those include 10 ETFs from Themes, 14 from Defiance, and 12 from LevMax. To put those numbers in perspective, there were a total of 42 leveraged single-stock ETFs on the market at the beginning of the year, according to Morningstar Direct data. The first such products appeared after the SEC approved the concept in 2022. “Retail investors have long desired to have institutional trading options for a long period of time, but they’ve been hamstrung, because options can be difficult, shorting can be difficult, and there are all sorts of risks that can be associated with those things,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer of Themes ETFs. The most aggressive of the proposed products are the triple-leveraged LevMax ETFs. Those funds have “a predetermined upside return cap” but also seek to limit downside by “matching any negative performance of the underlying security on a one-to-one basis,” the prospectuses state. Themes, whose US ETF assets just surpassed $100 million, would seek “accelerated returns” with caps on the potential upside on five ETFs using at-the-money calls with a one-month expiration. The upside cap would come from selling two call options. “This is just an innovative way to use period-certain leveraged exposure to some of the most popular names,” Marino said. “It’s a way to offer accelerated returns without taking accelerated risk.” Other ETFs in the works take different approaches: Rolling the Dice: The rise in leveraged ETFs “is super-connected with this surge in sports betting we’ve seen,” said Victor Haghani, founder of Elm Wealth. While there is a potential use case for young investors with low financial capital having some leverage via an S&P 500 ETF, even that instance would be difficult to justify, he said. With $100 invested in a 2X ETF, for example, “the cost of leverage is always going to be much higher than Treasury bills,” he said. “That second $100 (of exposure via leverage) isn’t really giving you anything.” There is no case for leveraged single-stock ETFs, he said. Even if a stock were to maintain its price over time, any volatility would lead to leveraged ETFs rebalancing often and creating a drag on net returns, not to mention fees, he said. “What you get is not what most people think they’re going to get.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity's complexity

Watch CBS News June 16, 2025 / 5:00 AM EDT / KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn't suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. "It's crazy," said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. "All of a sudden, they flip." Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn't address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy, and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what's becoming clear is that obesity isn't one disease — it's many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity's drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. "It only makes sense that it's complex to treat," Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn't respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn't significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity's many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation's infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a "Make America Healthy Again" agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. "That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now," said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. "We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions," he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she'd spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She's heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she's seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. "It opens up their world in so many ways." Over 26 years in practice, she's also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean's mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body's strongest hunger signals. "In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away," said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company's first drug. "In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn't exist. It's literally your brain telling you, 'You're starving,' as you eat." GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR's possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug's average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be "minimal." Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno's stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. "Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite," said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa's School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He's more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. "Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable," Foley Shenk said. "Now, we have our son back."

But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” Share This Story: We want to hear from you: Contact Us Republish This Story By Claire Sibonney June 16, 2025 Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Gains Long-Term Access to 45 MHz Mid-Band Spectrum Across North America
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AST_SpaceMobile_Gains_Long_Term_Access_to_45_MHz_Mid_Band_Spectrum_Across_North_America_999.html
Time Published: 2025-06-16T07:20:16Z

Under the agreement, Inmarsat will support AST SpaceMobile's rights to use up to 40 MHz of L-Band spectrum in North America for over 80 years, plus an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz band in the U.S. The deal is part of Ligado's ongoing restructuring process. Inmarsat will also endorse AST SpaceMobile's regulatory filings with the FCC and Canada's ISED to operate a non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) system within this spectrum. This Term Sheet supplements a March 2025 agreement between AST SpaceMobile and Ligado and remains contingent upon court approval, anticipated before June's end. Once completed, the transaction will enhance AST's capabilities, combining extensive LEO-based network technology with nationwide mid-band access, complementing its low-band spectrum assets known for deep coverage. Following regulatory approval, AST SpaceMobile will pay Ligado $550 million, including $535 million to Inmarsat. To support this, AST has secured a $550 million institutional financing commitment for a non-recourse, senior-secured delayed-draw term loan through a special-purpose vehicle. As part of resolving litigation between Ligado and Inmarsat, AST SpaceMobile has committed to advance payments totaling $535 million to Inmarsat on Ligado's behalf-$420 million due October 31, 2025, $100 million on March 31, 2026, and $15 million upon regulatory approval and transaction closing-contingent on a backstop commitment ensuring full refunds if approvals are not obtained. Financing for these pre-closure payments is already committed. AST SpaceMobile will begin spectrum access payments to Ligado starting September 30, 2025, as stipulated in the agreement. Currently, the company operates five BlueBird satellites in low Earth orbit. Each features a 700-square-foot array, providing intermittent cellular broadband over the U.S. and select regions globally. These satellites aim for full national coverage with over 5,600 U.S. service cells. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBirds will carry arrays as large as 2,400 square feet, delivering up to 120 Mbps data rates and enhanced voice and video capability.
