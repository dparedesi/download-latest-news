"I don't need to care about privacy because I have nothing to hide." is an argument that I have heard countless times. I found this argument difficult to counter in the past, yet deep-down I knew the reasoning was flawed. The problem is that the word "privacy" is dialuted and mean different things to different people. Instead of "privacy" we really should be talking about "control". Framed in this context, we can more concretely talk about why it's important to protect your digital identity. For me privacy is not the primary driver, because like you mentioned, it doesn't make sense for the common folk and doesn't actually fall into people's threat model (journalists on the other hand should care). I am personally motivated by the notion of "control". Can someone else meditate how I experience the world and what information I consume? Whether that is censoring, influencing how much time I have to spend watching ads or which ads I am allowed to watch. Can they influence how I vote? Watch the talk In Defense of Privacy for a more on this. Many of the convenient tools we use today (email, messaging, social media, password manager) are essential for daily life but they also yield control over to organizations (Google, Facebook, Amazon) that don't necessarily have our best interst in mind [1][2]. Questioning how "incentives align" is a really good litmus test for most things. Most of the following recommendations are based on my own threat model and comfort level. There will always be a compromise between effort and easy. It's best to pick what fits your lifestyle. Use a password manager! I use GNU pass because I don't want to hand over my passwords to a 3rd party. I typically only use the password manager from my laptop and don't access passwords from my phone (I consider this a better security practice). I have been meaning to try out passage. I would also recommend Bitwarden for those who want a better UI experience. (Whatsapp is an unfortunate exception and I hate that I need it to stay connected to friends and family). Signal for messaging is preferable [3]. Venmo is disabled. I run GrapheneOS on my Android. This allows me to sandbox, disable or uninstall apps rather than allowing super-privileged Google/ISP apps from doing whatever they wany on my personal device. By default, Google Play apps are unpriviledged and have to work within the sandbox model. GrapheneOS also allows you to restrict permissions at a granular level, including network access. You can also disable apps that you only use occasionally (Venmo, ride-sharing, Google play store). I try to use opensource alternatives for apps on F-Droid. Did you know disabling Google play store (also location services) increases your battery life by a lot! Not running bloated stock OS also means your 5 year old phone is still fast and usable (wtf do I need to but a new phone every 2 years?). I barely use social media and don't install it on my phone (I use social media in Browser containers to limit 3rd party cookies). I have a personal domain, which I use for email i.e. [email protected]. This allows me to switch providers whenever I want (e.g. lack of trust in Google, ProtonMail can raise their prices). These days I am using Tuta as my email provider because they are fast, offer a better price and have a strong focus on secure email. Also I can't be bothered to host my own email server. I use firefox with privacy badger and uOrigin because I do not opt into companies personally targeting me (can be contentious since some sites use this to make money). I host my calendar and contacts on a raspberrypi, which you can only access on localhost. The Caldav server is https://sabre.io/baikal, gets the job done. I use DAVx⁵ to sync the contacts on my phone. Disclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I switched to Cloudflare Registrar recently because they offered a lower price when my previous Registrar raised the price at renewal. I don't think Cloudflare really cares to make money on domain registration. I use Cloudflare's DNS because I trust them more than other companies; purely based on their business and how their incentives align (https://one.one.one.one/). There are other secure/anaonymous ones out there.

Title: US jobless claims slow in last full week of 2025 amid weak labour market

November saw highest unemployment since 2021, largely attributed to federal worker reductions under Trump. Share Save Over the past week, the number of United States residents applying for unemployment benefits has dropped to its lowest point in a month, according to new Labor Department statistics. The weekly data released on Wednesday came at the end of a year marked by a weak labour market, a phenomenon analysts partly blame on hiring hesitancy caused by US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Experts also warn that last week’s data may also be distorted by year-end holidays like Christmas: With the shorter work week, there was less opportunity to file unemployment claims. Wednesday’s numbers mark the final full week of unemployment data for 2025. Jobless claims for the week ending on December 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000. That was an improvement from the previous week, when the Labor Department recorded 215,000 jobless claims. Its report also showed that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,750. The US unemployment rate reached a peak of 4.6 percent in November, the highest percentage since 2021, when the country was grappling with the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase has largely been attributed to many federal employees leaving the workforce in the wake of Trump’s widespread cuts to government staffing. Jobless claims are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and offer a real-time indicator of the health of the country’s job market. Recent US government data has revealed a labour market in which hiring has lost momentum, even as other economic indicators, including the gross domestic product (GDP), have remained strong. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average of 35,000 a month, compared with 71,000 during the 12 months prior. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank reduced its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, out of concern that the job market is weaker than it appears. The move was the Fed’s third straight rate cut, with Powell saying recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. Recent data showed the US lost 105,000 jobs in October, largely due to departing federal workers, but the US economy gained back 64,000 jobs in November. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include the shipping giant UPS, automaker General Motors, online retailer Amazon and the telecommunications firm Verizon. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week's 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications. READ MORE: U.S. unemployment claims dropped again last week, remaining at a historically healthy level Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims. The weekly report was released a day early due to the New Year's Day holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk's purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department's report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines. The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. In December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media. The fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. Kyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out. Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. In March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue. Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Ticker: MSFT 2025 performance: +16% Wedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside) Rationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an "AI driven shift" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026. "While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments." Ticker: AAPL 2025 performance: +11% Wedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside) Rationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated. "The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts," he wrote.

As the year comes to a close, the Solana (SOL) ecosystem has recapped the key milestones reached in 2025. Meanwhile, SOL price is staging a late recovery, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. Solana’s official X account has described “2025 as a banger” in a year that saw the network attract major institutional interest. The team shared a three-minute video on X, chronicling the high points of 2025, including key partnerships with global financial service providers and network upgrades. Right off the bat, the video highlighted Western Union’s partnership with Solana to launch a stablecoin for global payments. Amid the flurry of institutional partnerships, the team underscored CME Group’s decision to launch spot-quoted SOL futures. Back in May, enterprise blockchain firm R3 announced a collaboration with the Solana Foundation to link its permissioned Corda platform with the permissionless Solana blockchain. In one market-moving announcement, BlackRock confirmed the expansion of its tokenized money market fund BUIDL to Solana, a watershed moment for the fledgling blockchain. Continuing the streak of institutional interest, JPMorgan arranged for US commercial paper issuance on Solana to wrap up a stellar year for the network. All year long, an avalanche of corporate treasuries jostled to scoop sizable amounts of SOL with DeFi Development Corp and Upexi leading the way. On the regulatory front, the Solana Policy Institute notched impressive milestones throughout 2025. The year marked the expansion of the Solana Economic Zone to Kazakhstan, the first in Central Asia, with the team seeking out new frontiers. In line with the expansionist policy, the team hosted several Solana Apex events in 2025 to onboard new users. A wildly successful Accelerate event and the launch of Solana Spaces on Wall Street added steam to its aggressive expansionist goals. Amid the recap, SOL price has indicated flashes of brilliance over the last day. CoinMarketCap data indicates that SOL is trading at $126.17, up nearly 3% from an intra-day low of $123. SOL ETF inflows on December 30 spiked to $5.2 million after a lengthy decline. While it pales in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the surge suggests that institutional investors are rotating into undervalued altcoins. Last week, an analyst described SOL as oversold, hinting at a near-term rally for the asset. Despite the uptick in SOL price, the asset has fallen by 57.13% from its all-time high of $294 that it set in early 2025.

Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. USA News Group Logo (PRNewsfoto/USA News Group) Issued on behalf of Avant Technologies Inc. VANCOUVER, BC, Dec. 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group News Commentary – Recent clinical trials achieving 83% insulin independence rates have ignited a dramatic shift in metabolic disease investment[1], with late-2025 M&A activity reaching record valuations as major pharmaceutical companies race to secure curative platforms over symptom-management franchises[2]. This pivot toward functional cures rather than chronic insulin dependence is defining the strategic roadmaps of Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO), Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ELDN), Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: VKTX), and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM). Analysts project the regenerative medicine market will surge from $37.98 billion in 2025 to $88.85 billion by 2030, driven by curative cell therapies now entering pivotal trials[3]. Meanwhile, FDA expedited review pathways have awarded over 350 designations across diabetes and metabolic diseases in the past three years[4], compressing clinical timelines by 30% and creating an urgent investment window as breakthrough therapies race toward commercial launch. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) is developing cell-based therapies for diabetes, aging, and chronic diseases using a proprietary encapsulation technology that protects genetically modified therapeutic cells from immune rejection. The company operates through two strategic joint ventures focused on addressing massive global health markets. The first, Insulinova, Inc., is a partnership with SGAustria Pte. Ltd., through which Avant is developing treatments for type 1 and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. The approach centers on a cell encapsulation technology that allows genetically modified insulin-producing cells to survive long-term in the body without being susceptible to any immune system attacks. This solves a fundamental problem that historically required patients to take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs with serious side effects. “Cell encapsulation is a game-changer in the field of regenerative medicine,” said Chris Winter, CEO of Avant Technologies. “By partnering with SGAustria, we’re ensuring that any genetically modified insulin-producing cells that we develop together can thrive in the body long-term and offer the potential of restoring natural glucose control and dramatically improving patients’ quality of life. This technology not only minimizes risks like immune rejection but also prevents potential complications such as cell escape or tumor formation, making it a cornerstone for safe and scalable diabetes therapies.” The diabetes market represents a substantial opportunity. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 589 million people globally live with type 1 and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, projected to reach 853 million by 2050. SGAustria’s Cell-in-a-Box® technology creates a protective barrier around genetically modified cells, shielding them from any immune response while allowing nutrients, oxygen, and insulin to pass through freely. Avant’s second joint venture, Klothonova, partners with Singapore-based Austrianova to develop anti-aging therapies and treatments for age-related diseases that restore circulating α-Klotho levels using genetically modified human cells that overexpress the Klotho protien. Research from the Mayo Clinic shows declining α-Klotho levels are associated with arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular calcification. Both joint venture projects will utilize cell-encapsulation platforms backed by over 50 publications representing decades of development. The potential market spans multiple therapeutic areas: the global Alzheimer’s market is projected to reach $32.8 billion by 2033, cardiovascular disease remains the world’s leading cause of death, and kidney disease affects 850 million people worldwide. CONTINUED… Read this and more news for Avant Technologies Inc. at https://usanewsgroup.com/2023/10/26/unlocking-the-trillion-dollar-ai-market-what-investors-need-to-know/ and https://usanewsgroup.com/avai-profile/ Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for once-weekly CagriSema (cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg), the first injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist and amylin analogue combination for weight management. In the REDEFINE 1 phase 3 trial, adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities taking CagriSema lost an average of 23% body weight when evaluating the treatment effect if all patients stayed on treatment, with 54% of patients with obesity at baseline reaching BMI below 30 kg/m2 at week 68. The trial included 3,417 adults with 87.4% of patients on steroids at baseline successfully tapering to prednisone 5 mg per day or less by Week 24. The FDA is expected to review the CagriSema application in 2026, with Health Canada granting the first approval outside the U.S. in August 2025. Potential approvals are anticipated in the United Kingdom and Australia in the first half of 2026 and Switzerland in 2027, while Novo Nordisk finalizes a strategy with the European Medicines Agency to support EU marketing authorization. Eledon Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ELDN) recently announced preliminary data from six patients with Type 1 diabetes treated with tegoprubart following islet transplantation at UChicago Medicine. All six subjects achieved insulin independence after one or two transplants, with one patient maintaining HbA1c as low as 4.7% for over 15 months without exogenous insulin. Tegoprubart was well tolerated with no serious infections, thromboembolic events, or kidney and neurological toxicity commonly seen with calcineurin inhibitors. “For years, clinicians have been working to find a new medication that can prevent rejection of islet cells while offering a better safety profile than calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus, which remain the current standard of care but are often associated with debilitating metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular toxicities,” said Piotr Witkowski, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Pancreas and Islet Transplant Program at UChicago Medicine. “These preliminary data in the first six subjects with T1D are very encouraging, with all six subjects achieving insulin independence.” The trial has been extended to 12 subjects, and Breakthrough T1D has committed to fund a second study in T1D patients with chronic kidney disease. Eledon is developing tegoprubart as a tacrolimus-free immunosuppression regimen for preventing transplant rejection. Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) announced completion of enrollment ahead of schedule in its Phase 3 VANQUISH-1 trial evaluating subcutaneous VK2735, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, for treating obesity. The 78-week study enrolled approximately 4,650 adults with obesity or who are overweight with weight-related comorbidities, exceeding the target enrollment. The trial is evaluating weekly VK2735 doses of 7.5 mg, 12.5 mg, and 17.5 mg compared to placebo, with a primary endpoint of percent change in body weight from baseline at 78 weeks. “We are excited to announce completion of enrollment in VANQUISH-1 ahead of schedule,” said Brian Lian, Ph.D., CEO of Viking. “As with prior VK2735 studies, the trial accrued rapidly and exceeded our enrollment target. We believe this speaks to the enthusiasm for new obesity treatments beyond those currently available.” The company expects to complete enrollment in its Phase 3 VANQUISH-2 study of VK2735 in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity in the first quarter of 2026. VK2735 demonstrated up to 14.7% mean body weight reduction with no signs of plateau in the Phase 2 VENTURE study, along with encouraging safety and tolerability. Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ: TNDM) has launched its t:slim mobile application in Canada for both Android and iOS users, enabling patients to deliver boluses from compatible smartphones and wirelessly upload pump data to the cloud-based Tandem Source platform. The secure application displays the last 24 hours of glucose trends, pump status changes, insulin therapy data, and pump alerts while maintaining the t:slim X2 insulin pump’s independent functionality. Users can view pump information and program requests from either their pump or smartphone. “With this release, we are furthering our commitment to expand our innovative, integrated solutions to customers worldwide,” said John Sheridan, president and CEO of Tandem Diabetes Care. “We are thrilled to be able to bring the benefits of the Tandem t:slim mobile app to our customers in Canada for both iOS and Android devices.” The mobile app is available for download on the Apple App Store and Google Play, with eligible customers receiving email instructions for setup. Users must have t:slim X2 insulin pump version 7.8.1 or above to pair their pump with a compatible smartphone and begin using the application.

Record high metal prices, interest rate cuts and trade wars have all boosted the FTSE 100's appeal. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Wednesday 31 December 2025 17:54, UK The UK's flagship stock index has had its best year since 2009 after a series of record-breaking days. The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 ended the year up 21.5% compared to the start. It means the share price of the publicly traded companies making up the FTSE 100 had the greatest annual increase in 16 years. The FTSE 100 comprises the hundred most valuable companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Notable constituents include lenders such as Barclays, Natwest, HSBC and Lloyds and supermarket chains Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's.

Schwimmer urges Reeves to unleash £100bn UK stock market boom How markets reacted to uncertainty over Rachel Reeves's future Stricken currency firm Argentex in talks about emergency sale There was a series of record-breaking moments for the UK's benchmark index across the 12 months, the most recent of which was on 30 December. There were 41 all-time high closes for the FTSE 100 in 2025, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Why? It has been boosted by a weak pound at points over the year, which made it good value to buy shares priced in sterling, as FTSE 100 companies tend to be. Many of the mining giants have done well as minerals like gold, silver and copper reached new highs. Investors moved money into the metals as they were perceived as safe investments while markets were volatile. The promise of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England also helped lift the FTSE 100. It had also benefited from investors looking to companies outside of the US after President Trump's trade war against China, and much of the world, began in earnest on 2 April on his so-called Liberation Day. Many trade deals have since been agreed. How does it compare? The UK's top-flight index also outperformed European and US rivals. France's CAC 40 index gained more than 10% in 2025, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 increased nearly 16%. Germany's DAX also rose 21.5%. After a year that saw tech company valuations soar, as investors sought to benefit from an anticipated artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Wall Street's S&P 500 rose 17%. The S&P 500 is the US index containing companies relied on to be stable and profitable, and contains the Magnificent 7 highest-performing tech companies. Among the Magnificent 7 is the most valuable company in the world, AI-chipmaker Nvidia, as well as Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet.

All Rights Reserved. “Help Wanted” sign is displayed at a dry cleaner in Rolling Meadows, Ill., Thursday, May 15, 2025. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, file) WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week with layoffs remaining low despite a weakening labor market. U.S. applications for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 27 fell by 16,000 to 199,000 from the previous week’s 215,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet forecast 208,000 new applications. Unemployment benefit filings are often distorted during holiday-shortened weeks. The shorter week can cause some who have lost jobs to delay filing claims. The weekly report was released a day early due to the New Year’s Day holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this month, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. That helped to push the unemployment rate up to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. The Labor Department’s report Wednesday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 1,750 to 218,7500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 20 fell by 47,000 to 1.87 million, the government said. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Title: Strategy accumulates over 22,000 Bitcoin, RWAs top $19 billion: December in Charts

The Bitcoin price slump at the end of the year hasn’t discouraged Michael Saylor’s Strategy from buying over 22,000 BTC in December alone. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin’s price continued to fall as 2025 neared its end, declining 4% in December. Despite a slump in markets, Strategy capped off the year with massive Bitcoin buys. In December alone, the software company turned Bitcoin investment vehicle picked up over 22,000 Bitcoin (BTC). In the US, prediction markets are inking deals with major media outlets and scoring approvals from major federal agencies. However, in 11 states, gambling and gaming regulators are taking legal action against platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. Watchdogs state that such markets constitute a form of gambling, a claim the companies themselves dispute. As crypto grows more mainstream, hackers and scammers are increasingly targeting investors and protocols. In December, crypto exploits topped $22.5 million. Chainalysis also released its annual scam report, stating that crypto thefts hit $3.4 billion in 2025. Here’s December by the numbers: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin investment vehicle, Strategy, picked up another stack of Bitcoin in December. The publicly traded company bought 22,628 BTC this month, according to Strategy’s Bitcoin purchase disclosures. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 672,497 BTC, or roughly 3.3% of the 19.9 million Bitcoin currently in circulation. The purchases in December capped off a year of aggressive accumulation by Strategy. The company disclosed Bitcoin purchases in 41 separate weeks of 2025. That’s a marked increase from 18 weeks in 2024 and just eight in 2023. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Strategy’s success in offering debt to fund new Bitcoin purchases has inspired other companies to become “Bitcoin treasury firms” — i.e., companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, 192 public companies hold almost 1.1 million BTC in their treasuries. Bitcoin’s price fell over 4% this month and is trading at $88,000 at publishing time. The asset is slated to end the year down below where it started, around $94,000, and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set in October. Some traders say that Bitcoin is set for further losses, possibly down to $40,000; that is, if the traditionally understood four-year boom-and-bust cycle is still intact. Not everyone is convinced, though. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, previously told Cointelegraph that institutional demand through things like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries has softened the blow. “While the bull market may face near-term consolidation amid macroeconomic pressures, we anticipate it will extend into 2026 with support from ongoing structural inflows and evolving market dynamics,” he said. Betting markets are making headway in the US. On Dec. 4, CNBC signed a contract with Kalshi to integrate real-time forecasting data from the betting market on CNBC’s TV, digital and subscription platforms. But state regulators are not pleased. That same week, Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection sent letters to Kalshi, Crypto.com and Robinhood, ordering them to cease operations in the state. There are now 11 states in which prediction markets are facing legal action from regulators. Kalshi similarly received cease-and-desist letters in Ohio, Illinois, Arizona, Montana and New York. Regulators in those states cited that the market was offering unlicensed gambling, a claim that Kalshi rejects. In Massachusetts, state prosecutors claim that Kalshi has disguised sports betting as “event contracts.” Kalshi said the state is “trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.” A spokesperson for the company previously told Cointelegraph, “It’s very different from what state-regulated sportsbooks and casinos offer their customers. We are confident in our legal arguments and have filed suit in federal court.” In December, hackers made away with $22.5 million across 10 incidents, according to data from DefiLlama, a drop in the bucket compared with other months this year. In February, hackers stole $1.4 billion in assets from the crypto exchange Bybit. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its annual crypto hack report that this year’s crypto thefts totaled $3.4 billion. It added that personal wallet attacks have “grown substantially, increasing from just 7.3% of total stolen value in 2022 to 44% in 2024. In 2025, the share would have been 37% if it weren’t for the outsized impact of the Bybit attack.” Sophisticated attacks from state-sponsored actors have been a particular problem for large, centralized organizations like crypto exchanges. Cybercriminals associated with the government of North Korea reportedly stole $2.02 billion in cryptocurrency this year. The total distributed asset value of real-world assets (RWAs) rose 3% in December, surpassing $19 billion. The largest section of these assets is tokenized US Treasurys at $8.7 billion, followed by commodities at $3.5 billion. This places RWAs as the fifth-largest asset category in decentralized finance by total value locked, according to DefiLlama, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories,” DeFiLlama noted. A number of tokenized fund products like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Ondo’s OUSG are driving increased valuation with tokenized Treasurys. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of Kronos Research, previously told Cointelegraph that for further growth in RWAs, “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity and integration into TradFi.” Magazine: Big questions: Would Bitcoin survive a 10-year power outage?

Jobless claims dipped last week as layoffs remained low, despite a softening labor market. While applications fell to 199,000, analysts expected more. Recent job gains were modest, with the unemployment rate climbing. This data suggests hiring momentum has slowed, prompting the Fed to trim interest rates amid concerns about job market weakness. 2025 throwback: Op Sindoor to Shubhanshu Shukla's space mission Rajnath Singh, UP CM hoist flag at Ram Janmbhoomi Temple Sarma urges Hindus to have more children Gig workers to go on strike on Dec 31 Trains collide inside Chamoli tunnel CRPF distributes radios in Naxal-hit Bastar WB: Shah predicts 2/3rd majority BMC polls: Nomination deadline ends Assam police arrest 11 linked to IMK module We will drive out infiltrators: Amit Shah Hot on Web In Case you missed it Top Searched Companies Top Calculators Top Definitions Top Slideshow Top Prime Articles Private Companies Top Commodities Top Story Listing Latest News Follow us on: Find this comment offensive?

December 31, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® ETFs today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Group 2 weekly pay ETFs. Group 2 Distribution Announcement Ex. & Record Date: January 2, 2026Payment Date: January 5, 2026 Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968. For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 30, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Share this article BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), drew over $143 million in new capital on Tuesday, breaking a run of outflows since December 23 that had reached $449 million and signaling renewed institutional demand for the leading digital asset. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has facilitated growing client access to Bitcoin through its investment products. The firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF has emerged as a key vehicle for institutional allocations to crypto assets. Alongside IBIT, funds managed by ARK Invest/21shares and Fidelity posted strong inflows, pulling in approximately $110 million and $79 million, respectively. Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale products also finished the day in positive territory. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs closed Tuesday with $355 million in net capital, snapping a seven-day outflow streak. The renewed inflows came amid a resurgence in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin reclaimed $89,000 on Tuesday before retreating to $88,729, according to CoinGecko data.

WPBeginner - WordPress Tutorials for Beginners Categories Popular Posts Starter Guides Helpful Resources WordPress Plugin Training Premium WordPress Courses (for FREE!) Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»News»Best of Best WordPress Tutorials of 2025 on WPBeginner By Editorial Staff | January 1, 2026 | Reader Disclosure As the year comes to an end, we’re taking a moment to look back at some of the best tutorials we’ve published on WPBeginner in 2025. While 2025 brought us plenty of exciting WordPress updates and new features, one topic naturally stood out this year: Artificial Intelligence. Our goal wasn’t for you to simply watch the AI revolution unfold, but to use it in practical ways to grow your website and business. That is why we shared practical guides on using AI inside WordPress, along with step-by-step tutorials, and smart automation techniques to help you work faster and more effectively. At the same time, our core mission remains unchanged: to make WordPress easier for everyone, whether you are just starting out or managing a growing business. In 2025, we published hundreds of guides designed to help you build better websites, master new tools, and improve your skills. In this roundup, we’ve carefully selected the most popular and helpful tutorials of the year. Whether you missed these articles or want a quick way to revisit them, this guide will help you catch up on all the must-read WordPress and AI content from 2025. Note: Syed did a personal 2025 year end review on his blog that has more business lessons and insights along with goals for 2026. 2025 has been a remarkable year for the WPBeginner team. From expanding our WordPress tutorials to experimenting with new tools and workflows, our focus stayed the same: helping users succeed without unnecessary complexity. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our team and the continued support of the WPBeginner community. Similarly, our family of products made significant progress, focusing on artificial intelligence, automation, and user experience. Here’s how our top tools evolved to help you grow your business. WPForms WPForms is the most beginner-friendly WordPress form builder on the market. Over 6 million websites use it to create contact forms, payment forms, surveys, and more with a simple drag-and-drop interface that’s now even easier with AI. This year, we shipped a ton of new features, with a heavy focus on automation and AI. We launched AI-powered form generation, so you can describe the form you need, and WPForms will build it for you in seconds. We also added AI Calculations, which lets you turn plain English into complex calculation formulas without using math or weird syntax. This is great for eCommerce, event planners, real estate, consultants, or anyone who needs dynamic pricing or custom calculations. One of the most requested releases was our new PDF Addon, which automatically turns form submissions into professional documents. It’s a huge time-saver if you need to create invoices, contracts, receipts, or certificates after someone fills out a form. On the integration front, we added seamless connections with Airtable, Google Drive, Notion, Make.com, and n8n. These integrations make it easier than ever to automate workflows and keep data synced across tools. Plus, we introduced the Entry Automation Addon, which automatically exports and cleans up form entries. For example, automatically export last week’s leads to a spreadsheet every Monday morning, or delete entries older than 90 days to stay compliant with privacy laws. We also launched a Camera Field for capturing photos directly in forms. We built this because we wanted to collect video testimonials without paying for a third-party SaaS. Now, our users can do the same. Design also got a boost with Form Themes for All, making professional styling accessible to everyone with no CSS required. Plus, free users gained the ability to accept payments via Square, which is a big win for small business owners who want to get paid faster. We truly believe that WPForms is a must-have plugin for WordPress users, and we also have a free version that you can download straight from the WordPress plugin directory. AIOSEO All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is the best WordPress SEO plugin, and over 3 million website owners use it to improve their rankings, add schema markup, and manage their SEO right inside WordPress. This year, we shipped a ton of updates, with a big focus on AI search visibility, faster content creation, and clearer reporting to prepare for the future of search. One of our biggest releases was the AI Assistant, which works right inside the WordPress editor. It can generate entire articles from a simple prompt, so you can spend less time drafting and more time optimizing. We also introduced the AI Content Generator, which can generate FAQ blocks, key points, social posts, and even SEO titles and meta descriptions directly in WordPress. Another game-changing update was our AI Image Generator, which instantly creates unique, on-brand visuals and saves them to your media library. No need to design your own graphics or buy stock photos. We also rolled out our new AI-powered Keyword Report tool, which lets you see which brands are ranking for search queries in AI search results. This is the best tool to prepare you for Generative Engine Optimization (AI Search). Technical SEO saw major upgrades with the new Index Status Report and AI Insights, which help you see exactly how Google sees your content and uncover hidden opportunities without leaving the dashboard. To give you more control over how AI systems see your content, we also introduced the LLMs.txt Generator. It lets you manage how large language models read your site, which is becoming increasingly important as AI engines index the web. Other key updates included a visual Site Audit tool for finding issues faster, advanced Crawl Controls to manage bot traffic, and a highly requested feature for duplicating posts and pages. We strongly recommend checking out AIOSEO if you want to grow your website rankings. We also have a free version that you can download from the WordPress plugin directory. SeedProd AI Website Builder SeedProd is the best drag-and-drop WordPress website builder used by 1+ million website owners. It makes it easy for anyone to create custom landing pages and full websites without hiring a developer or touching code. This year, our team redefined website building for WordPress users with the launch of the AI Website Builder. This game-changing tool allows you to generate a complete, fully designed WordPress website, including copy and images, in less than 60 seconds simply by describing your business in plain text. It’s the fastest way to go from “I need a website” to “my site is live and ready to edit.” Beyond AI, we rolled out a completely redesigned dashboard to streamline user workflows. This makes it easier to manage your pages, jump between projects, and keep everything organized as your site grows. SeedProd also expanded the design library with over 15 new industry-specific themes and upgraded the Image Carousel block. It’s now even easier to build a website that looks polished right from the start. You can download the free version of SeedProd from the WordPress plugin directory. Other Notable Product Highlights There have been many more exciting updates across all our products, and it’s hard to cover everything in one place. I recommend that you check out our WordPress plugins page to see what we’re building. Your continued support truly means a lot to us. Acquisitions and Investments Through the WPBeginner Growth Fund, we continue to invest in and support companies that solve important problems for WordPress users. This year, we were thrilled to welcome aThemes to our family of products. aThemes is the team behind some of the most popular and lightweight WordPress themes on the market, including Sydney and Botiga.

Title: 2025 in Review: James Baratta

Full Content:
I joined the Prospect as a writing fellow in Spring 2025, just months before President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. Much of my reporting out of the gate chronicled how our social safety net and constitutional democracy have been falling apart at the seams since Trump returned to the White House. While the focus of my coverage has varied over the past several months, a common thread that can be found throughout is arguably regulation. I’ve written about the implications of rolling back key guardrails designed to protect consumers, workers, and the environment. Many of those same stories highlighted the Trump administration’s attacks on federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the extent of regulatory capture taking hold at both the state and federal levels. Speaking of regulatory capture, a fair amount of my recent reporting has centered on the role of state-level public utility commissions in regulating investor-owned utilities. As compelling as it is to lay the blame on data centers for driving up electricity prices, utility commissions are responsible for setting rates. They also have the final say on whether regulated utilities can merge or be acquired by another company. In both instances, these commissions have largely refrained from challenging investor-owned utilities, instead opting to rubber-stamp rate increases and fold in the face of private utility takeovers. And with that, I’d like to reflect on a few stories I had the pleasure of writing for the Prospect in 2025. In April, the Department of Transportation declared open season on “burdensome” regulations to implement executive orders issued by President Trump in the early days and weeks of his second term. The freight rail industry, whose largest members are represented by the Association of American Railroads, made quick work of the opportunity to write its own rules and roll back regulations that impede extreme cost-cutting measures. At the time, I wrote about the industry’s push to reduce already threadbare crews with remotely operated or entirely autonomous trains, and replace visual safety inspections with Automated Track Inspection machines. Unions representing rail workers sounded the alarm on these safety-averse proposals. Organizers told me carriers’ efforts to automate the rail industry not only undermine labor, but endanger employees and trackside communities alike. Read the story. For this story, I teamed up with Prospect staff writer Whitney Curry Wimbish to dispel the allure of including private equity and cryptocurrency investments in personal retirement plans. Our reporting found that exposing the nation’s multitrillion-dollar defined contribution market to high-risk asset classes not only threatens to worsen the looming retirement crisis, but functionally provides a bailout to cash-strapped, underperforming private equity firms. Rather than democratizing access to a wider set of financial instruments, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to soften existing regulatory guidance to give plan sponsors more cover for making these investments available to retail investors. Read the story. I went to the Twin Cities in October to attend the final Minnesota Public Utilities Commission hearing on BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ $6.2 billion proposal to acquire Minnesota Power and its parent company, ALLETE. The commission unanimously approved the deal, and we brought you inside the room where it all went down. My post-hearing dispatch was a follow-up to a previous story I had written about pushback against the acquisition and the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s role in drumming up support for the takeover. Read the story. Concurrently, I had been chipping away at what would become my first-ever long-form feature for the Prospect. The piece offers a comprehensive look at the root causes of soaring electricity prices, influence-peddling by investor-owned utilities, and efforts by public power advocates to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system. My reporting also took me to Milwaukee, where I shadowed organizers with Milwaukee Democratic Socialists of America’s Power to the People campaign. As one public power advocate told me, the energy system “connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric.” Read the story.

Title: Fact check: Content farm videos on Merz, Starmer and Trump
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-content-farm-videos-on-merz-starmer-and-trump/a-75262035
Time Published: 2025-12-31T09:28:00Z

Fake videos of political leaders often go viral online. DW's Fact check department analyzes how content farms use algorithm-driven formats, and what narratives they reinforce. Disinformation campaigns targeting politicians are nothing new, but the widespread availability of AI tools has accelerated the spread of deepfake videos and false claims. DW Fact check has examined viral videos featuring three world leaders — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump — looking at how the video formats work, how they spread and what narratives they push. Claim: This TikTok video, with over 360,000 views, claims the German government has fixed gasoline prices at €3 ($3.50) per liter. Verdict: Fake The video combines visuals of Friedrich Merz, stock footage and a banner with the words "Fuel price shock: Fixed at €3 — now it's serious!" Although the regulation of price fluctuation and CO2 price increases have been discussed in Germany, no official announcement has fixed the prices at €3. The current price is set at €1.64 per liter. Such a drastic increase would have a huge financial impact on many people. We also analyzed the technical part of the video: The voice-over shows several anomalies, including noticeable glitches. Not only that, AI detection tools such as HIVE indicate a 69.6% likelihood that the content contains AI-generated or deepfake elements. Claim: A post on X with over 766,000 views claims the UK has issued a 10 p.m. curfew and will shut off television and internet at night. Verdict: False The post includes a video of a man repeating the claim, superimposed on photographs with ominous music playing in the background. He references the UK's digital ID plans, alluding to a smartphone-based identification system for governmental services in the UK, which caused controversy and concerns of government overreach. The UK government did indeed implement new rules governing how children use social media on July 25, 2025, under the Online Safety Act. These regulations require platforms to conduct robust age checks — using methods like facial scans, photo ID, or credit card verification. However, no curfews were enforced, nor was internet access restricted. Claim: In this TikTok video with 578,000 views, we see US President Donald Trump and hear a voice-over that sounds like him. The words "Macron warns Zelemskyy [sic] — Trump fires back with harsh message" written on a banner. Verdict: Fake The video also features subtitles of the voice-over and constant zooming into images of French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The voice-over sounds like Trump, but its intonation is generic and monotone. The HIVE AI-detection tool estimates that it is 99% likely that the audio is AI-generated. Marcus Bösch, political scientist and communications expert and a former DW contributor, said there are steps users can take to identify fake videos. "The first thing you should do is take a look at the account that posted the video," he told DW media partner #Faktenfuchs. The TikTok account that posted the video of Merz has what looks like an AI-generated profile image, and the profile name includes a string of numbers, typical indicators that it is part of a content farm. We found multiple other accounts posting similar videos targeting Merz (including here, here, here and here). They all bear the hallmarks of a so-called "content farm." Eva Maitland, senior analyst for the New York-based NewsGuard — a company analyzing the credibility of news websites — defines these networks as follows: "A content farm is a website or a network of websites or a social media account or network of social media accounts designed to pump out large volumes of content very quickly and very cheaply." Search engine optimization (SEO) plays an important role for such accounts, as keywords will make them appear more often in search engine results and therefore gather more views and clicks. Video topics might change depending on the news cycle and changing public interest. Maitland noted that as content farms try to publish as much and as fast as possible, they often use content based on templates. Both the account that posted the video of Merz and the account that shared the video of Trump had posted several videos in similar visual styles. The fake "news item" has become a recurring format, which DW Fact check has written about previously. These videos mimic legitimate reporting and attach themselves to real political debates. The accounts above also show the repeated use of phrases like "breaking news" or "shocking announcement." This is a classic strategy in disinformation dissemination. "You take something people have already heard before, or something that contains a grain of truth — because that makes it very believable," said Bösch. The videos typically use authentic footage of the politicians but overlay them with AI-generated voice-overs. They include fabricated claims on upcoming policies, such as "Starting in January: Sick? Then stay home, or else you'll be fined and won't get paid!" Julia Smirnova, senior researcher at the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), told #Faktenfuchs, "The videos are designed to trigger a moment of surprise, shock, annoyance or joy in viewers." Maitland urges users to question what the purpose of the content is: "Are they trying to inform me or are they trying to get me to react in a certain way?" The true motives behind the videos are challenging to determine. Importantly, platforms have a threshold for monetization. For TikTok it is based on views and engagement: at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Maitland suggests that "the aspect that the videos are extremely low quality, they're templated, they're AI-generated, they're being produced in high-volume, low-quality, indicates that the campaign may be more motivated to generate income as opposed to genuinely affecting people's viewpoints." The profile that posted the video on Merz states that "All videos are satire and do not contain any real statements whatsoever." Accounts protect themselves in this way, as social media platforms like TikTok allow for AI content as freedom of expression. Whether users believe the content is difficult to determine. Comment sections show mixed reactions: Some users treat the content as a joke, but many take it seriously, while some question the claims. NewsGuard found that the claim of the UK curfew has spread from TikTok to other platforms like Facebook and X. This poses a challenge to users who try to verify the video's source, because it's stripped from the context of the account. A recent report from the voice AI platform Resemble AI found that there has been a record increase in the number of deepfake cases and sophisticated attacks. As AI tools are becoming more sophisticated, this type of content farm video and posting behavior is likely to grow in the future. Tommaso Canetta, fact-checking coordinator at the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO), warned that the loss of a shared reality is ultimately a danger to democracy. "Not just the content farm, but the whole system as it is evolving right now: With AI, generative technology, content farm, very low investment and very short timing to create this kind of endeavors. Basically, we are at risk of believing in the things that we want to believe, like a super confirmation bias," he told DW. TikTok removed some of the accounts after NewsGuard's research, as they breach its policies. But over half are still online. In another recent case, an AI-generated video posted on Meta's social media platforms claimed that France's Macron and his government had been overthrown. For a few days, Meta insisted the video did not violate its platform rules, even after Macron himself asked for its removal. Despite EU-wide regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the EU AI Act , which oblige platforms to label AI and remove disinformation, AI-generated content continues to pose significant challenges. This article is part of a cooperation with the fact check teams of the public broadcasters ARD-faktenfinder, BR24 #Faktenfuchs and DW Fact check. Edited by: Rayna Breuer

In a new CNBC Squawk Box interview, Ives says that artificial intelligence (AI) will likely cause the following five tech companies to outperform next year: Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Apple (AAPL). “It’s about the derivatives of the AI revolution playing out. That’s our whole thesis going into 2026. For every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, there’s an eight to 10 multiplier across the rest of tech. And that’s why I think those five are the ones specifically going into early part of ’26 that I think are going to boom. That’s why we pound the table on those five names.” Ives says that Microsoft, which closed at $487 on Tuesday, may soon soar into the $500 range. “When you look at enterprise, as you see the movements in the cloud and AI, [Microsoft’s] really owning that race. I think this is a stock [with a] $100 upside.” He also says that Apple, which is trading for around $273 at time of writing, could see AI innovation drive its price into the $300 range. “[Apple’s] been nowhere in AI. But now, as we go into ’26, we expect a major Google partnership in terms of the spring. Now, the consumer AI revolution goes through [Apple’s headquarters in] Cupertino, and I think that is significant. We talk about a $75 incremental in the stock is the AI multiple. That starts to increase for Apple. That’s why I view that as just a glaring name that sticks out.” Lastly, Ives says that Tesla, which closed the market Tuesday at $454 per share, will likely surge due to advancements with its autonomous vehicles and robotics. “The whole story is the autonomous chapters now coming to Tesla, and I think it’s going be the most important year in its history for [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk and Tesla… We think autonomous is worth a trillion dollars alone to the Tesla story… I think Tesla’s front and center in terms of physical AI. That’s why we love that name.” CrowdStrike closed on Tuesday at $475, up more than 39% year to date. Meanwhile, Palantir was trading at $180 at market close, up more than 139% year to date.

Title: Asian shares trade mixed with some exchanges closed ahead of the New Year

Wall Street is drifting lower before the opening bell on the final day of trading for 2025, a banner year for markets that was driven by both optimism and uncertainty Wall Street drifting lower before the opening bell, heading for the fourth day of losses, on the final day of trading for 2025, a banner year for markets that was driven by both optimism and uncertainty. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each ticked down 0.1% early Wednesday. Nasdaq futures were off 0.2%. Institutional investors are largely closed out of their positions for the year, so trading is expected to be extremely light. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for New Year's Day. The S&P 500 is up more than 17% this year as investors embraced artificial intelligence technology, both in the sector and its potential across almost all other sectors. The AI frenzy that drove markets in 2025 did not come without concerns. Chief among them is the worry that artificial intelligence technology may not produce enough profits and productivity to make all the investment worth it. That could keep the pressure on AI stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom, which were responsible for much of the market’s gains this year. And it’s not just AI stocks that critics say are too pricey. Stocks across the market still look expensive after their prices climbed faster than profits. On top of concerns that stocks are overvalued, the ongoing impact of a wide-ranging U.S.-led trade war threatens to add more fuel to inflation in the U.S. While the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark lending rate three times to close out the year, inflation remains solidly above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited concerns over a weakening labor market as their motivation for cutting rates. Arriving later Wednesday is the Labor Department’s most recent data on weekly jobless claim applications, which are viewed as a proxy for layoffs. The Fed has signaled more caution moving forward. Minutes from its December meeting reflect the divisions within the central bank as it deals with uncertainty about the threats facing the economy. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its next meeting in January. Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, believes uncertainty is brewing for global markets because of inflation, labor shortages and questions about where interest rates might be headed. “Central banks must tread carefully, and financial markets will likely experience continued volatility as expectations shift,” he said. “For businesses, investors, and policymakers alike, flexibility, risk management, and close attention to economic signals will be essential in navigating the challenges ahead.” Trading in precious metals continued to be volatile as the year winds down. Silver swung back to a big loss, giving back more than 8% early Wednesday after Tuesday's gain of more than 10%. Following Friday's 7.7% jump, silver lost nearly 9% on Monday. It's still up more than 140% this year. Gold fell 1.5% Wednesday morning but is still up 66% in 2025. Elsewhere, global stock markets including Germany, Japan and South Korea were closed Wednesday for the New Year's holidays, while trading was mixed in those that remained open. France's CAC 40 lost 0.5% by midday, while Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.2%. Earlier in Asia, the Hang Seng index dipped 0.9% to 25,630.54, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 3,968.84. The Taiex in Taiwan jumped 0.9% to 28,963.60. In Australia, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 dipped less than 0.1% to 8,714.30. Tokyo trading was set to be closed for the New Year's holidays on Thursday and Friday and scheduled to reopen on Monday. In South Korea, trading was scheduled to be closed on Thursday. U.S. crude picked up 31 cents to $58.26 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 28 cents to $61.61 per barrel. Yet crude, unlike some other commodities this year, has been falling in prices. A barrel of crude costs 19% less today than it did at the start of the year, and gas prices are down 6% to 7% nationally, or about 20 cents per gallon. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Wishes for a Happy New Year (above all), cooperative banks are seeking investors, who will join the Swiss franc restructuring, firefighters and police officers in Intralot!

Greetings. Today we are starting the last Dark Room of 2025, with wishes for health and happiness in the salvific new year 2026, until we speak again, God willing, on Monday, January 5. Until then, and with the permission of our good farmers who are slightly relaxing the roadblocks, we will be able to go on holiday or at least move around the Greek countryside, probably with somewhat more wintry weather. Perhaps even with a little snow—don’t imagine anything dramatic. Otherwise, it seems that there must have been a lot of backlash in society against the tactics and behavior of the farmers who block the roads (something… more than what fell on the government), and that’s why they decided to step a bit aside and open the roads somewhat so people can go on their holidays or return to their homes. An era of frenzy… The truth is that in all the years I’ve been working, I don’t remember a single time, under any government, when the prime minister called a professional group—farmers or anyone else—to dialogue and they refused to go and instead sent an ultimatum. You might say, here we saw a soldier—indeed from the Special Forces—speaking at a protest rally about the budget, and the KKE and SYRIZA issuing statements because he was removed from the Special Forces and even received a prison sentence in the Army. Incredible things, right? Really, what would happen in Russia or China or Cuba if a conscript went to demonstrations—don’t the KKE or SYRIZA tell us? Of course, this is not allowed even in normal Western democracies, nor does the Greek Constitution allow it. Carols and coffees In any case, the government and parties are slowing down these days and until the beginning of next week things will be relaxed. Tasoulas, Mitsotakis, and the political leaders will listen to the customary carols today, and then each will take the road for the last gifts they need to buy and for the New Year’s Eve dinner. Mitsotakis was supposed to give an interview on SKAI radio, but it was postponed. In any case, he will stay within the city walls, and on New Year’s Day he will honor the… customs, that is, service at the Metropolis and then coffee with Tasoulas at Da Capo in Kolonaki Square, despite the biting cold that morning. And after that, off with the yoke, since after many years the rather outdated custom of New Year’s greetings at the Presidential Mansion was “cut.” ATHEX: “For reasons of transparency and legal certainty” The Capital Market Commission asked ATHEX—for reasons of clarity—to inform the investing public what happened with the previous General Meeting, the invitation to shareholders, whether anything was approved or not, etc. After the intervention, ATHEX issued an announcement that it is convening again the extraordinary General Meeting on 20/1/26, because “it was deemed necessary due to procedural issues of convening the GM of the 22nd, during which in any case no relevant decisions were taken.” The announcement concludes that the Meeting must be repeated “for reasons of transparency and legal certainty.” The first plans of Euronext: Streamlining ATHEX operations Meanwhile, the future president of ATHEX, who is now awaiting January 20 to assume his duties, Camil Beutin, is an Euronext executive specializing in energy and has worked for more than three decades at Euronext Oslo and Nord Pool (an energy platform owned by Euronext). He is coming to Athens with a specific agenda that he will immediately put into action. He will start with the introduction of new exchange products (e.g. ETFs, which are particularly popular in Amsterdam) and at the same time will try to include Greek mid-cap listed companies (from €200 to €500 million) on other Euronext platforms, in countries where they already have export activity and are known. His goal is to broaden the reach of listed companies with shareholder-investors from countries where Euronext operates. It also appears, however, that the (necessarily) president-in-waiting Camil Beutin intends to “dig into” some files with issues that fall within the logic of rationalization and streamlining of ATHEX’s operations. Bank of Epirus received signals for January On December 15, the Executive Act of the Governor (EPATh) of the Bank of Greece was issued regarding the conditions for converting cooperative banks into public limited companies. Essentially, the BoG gave the green light to the four cooperative banks (Karditsa, Chania, Epirus, Thessaly) to obtain a nationwide license provided they have minimum share capital of €18 million. The Bank of Epirus held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on December 29 to convert into a public limited company, in order to open the way for the entry of strategic investor Peter Nomikos, who has expressed his intention to invest €30 million. Information suggests that the management of the Bank of Epirus now has clear indications that the fit & proper approval of P. Nomikos will come from the SSM within January, and therefore it is preparing the ground for a €30 million share capital increase. It is important that the capital increase will take place without dilution, but at the book value of the Bank of Epirus—though we will see this. All cooperative banks are seeking a strategic investor Based on the EPATh of the Bank of Greece, the former Cooperative Banks must adjust their own funds no later than March 31, 2026, and of course must have completed the process of converting into public limited companies in order to attract investors. Information indicates that Cooperative Bank of Thessaly is one step closer to the entry of a strategic investor; Karditsa has already expanded into neighboring prefectures but has not yet announced a broadening of its shareholder base; while in Chania, Ioannis Michos, coming from London, has joined as Executive Member of the Board with the goal of capital strengthening. The issue of capital is extremely important, since banking is now a very expensive business. Whether a bank has 1 branch or 100 branches, the very costly IT systems must be installed, supervisory capital must be available, and auditing procedures must be complete and operational. The game has started, and the efforts to capture market shares will be of exceptional interest. Teachers, police officers, and firefighters in Intralot A significant number of domestic mutual funds have taken positions in Intralot. As shown by the company’s shareholder register at the recent General Meeting, the largest positions are held by Alpha Bank and Optima mutual funds (Optima Greek Balanced, Optima Greek Equity) with approximately 6.6 million shares each; the National Asset Management mutual funds with approximately 5.6 million shares; while a significant position continues to be held by K. Antonopoulos, former CEO of the company, with approximately 9.2 million shares. Beyond that, there are smaller positions held by pension funds such as the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, funds for police officers and firefighters of New Jersey, mutual funds of Vanguard, Aviva, BlackRock, MorningStar, etc. Swiss franc: Who will ultimately say “yes” to the restructuring Banks have already started running their models for Swiss franc loans, as the new year brings developments. In about two months, borrowers will be called upon to decide whether they will join the restructuring, making a decision that will determine the course of their loan from now on. Banks are trying to determine the acceptance mix of the restructuring, since this is what will lead them to accurately calculate their provisions. According to banks’ estimates, those who can join the restructuring are borrowers without income criteria, and they will do so if their loan is not particularly mature. If, however, it is mature, given that their interest rate increases from 0% plus a 1% spread to 2.90%, they have no reason to do so. On the other hand, banks estimate that the greatest interest in the restructuring will come from those entitled to higher haircuts, based on income criteria. For this group, joining the restructuring may prove to be more attractive and a substantial relief, since the haircut reaches 50% and the interest rate 2.30%. However, a significant issue arises here: to what extent these particular borrowers can service the restructuring. It is worth highlighting an important advantage for many borrowers with a long repayment horizon: by converting the loan into euros, they essentially start from a point of departure where from then on they will see the outstanding balance of their loan gradually decrease—something that until now did not happen, due to the continuous appreciation of the Swiss franc. 25 listed companies have closed 280 meetings in Paris On January 29, 2026, a Thursday, the Piraeus Bank roadshow with companies listed on the Athens Exchange will finally take place at the famous Espace Cléry in Paris. Participation has already been locked in for 21 listed companies, and an impressively large number of one-on-one meetings with investors—more than 280—has been recorded. There is particular activity and interest for the “newcomers” to this institution, smaller-cap companies such as Profile, Alumil, AVAX, and Alter Ego. On the banking side, participation has already been confirmed (also with many meetings) by Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank, and Bank of Cyprus, followed by Metlen, Motor Oil, TITAN, OPAP, GEK TERNA, PPC, Athens International Airport, Cenergy, ELVALHALCOR, Aegean, HelleniQ Energy, Lamda Development, AVAX, KRI-KRI. Information indicates that the final number of participants will certainly reach 25, provided a sufficient number of one-on-one meetings is secured. Espace Cléry is an imposing, historic building in Paris’s 2nd arrondissement, in the heart of Sentier, and was once the residence of the famous painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. There, the 25 listed companies will paint the future of the Athens Stock Exchange… The background behind the shipping deals of the Greeks Greek shipowners continue to work quietly and methodically, letting their moves speak for themselves. During the festive period, the “hits” were many. On the newbuilding front, Aegean Bulk Co. Inc. closed four 82,000 dwt bulkers at Hengli Shipbuilding (Dalian), with deliveries in 2027–2028—a move read as a steady investment in capacity, without haste but with a clear horizon. At the same time, Cape Shipping shows it is not moving away from crude: one firm and one optional VLCC 319,000 dwt at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, for 2028, with scrubbers and a price around $119 million. Details matter here. In tankers, Capital Ship Management added two orders and two optional LR2/Aframax 114,000 dwt at Hengli, for delivery in 2028, discreetly strengthening its portfolio. V Group, on the other hand, opted for containers: two feeder 1,930 TEU at Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard, LNG dual-fuel, with deliveries 2028–2029. Those who follow the trends take notes. And in LPG, Benelux Overseas proceeded with two VLACs 93,000 cbm at HD Hyundai in South Korea, also dual-fuel, with delivery in 2028—a move showing persistence in a specific strategic path. In second-hand tonnage, the Greeks were not absent. The capesize ANTONIS ANGELICOUSSIS (177,855 dwt, 2007, Shanghai Waigaoqiao) changed hands at $20.5 million to Greek interests, while Oceanstar Management Inc. acquired the Ultramax IVS WINDSOR (60,279 dwt, 2016, Oshima) with cranes, for $26 million. At the same time, Greek-controlled vessels were also on the sellers’ side: the Handysize APHRODITE M (36,000 dwt, 2011, SPP) at $12.5 million, as well as the pair of Post-Panamax PORTO KAGIO and PORTO GERMENO (5,908 / 5,570 TEU, 2002, Koyo Dockyard), linked to Costamare, at $17 million each. The background shows that these are not spasmodic moves. Over the last twelve months, Greek interests count 132 new orders, 158 second-hand purchases, and 14 sales for recycling. As 2025 reached its end, the picture is clear: fleet renewal, careful choices, and a game played without noise but with clear targeting. Navios: Premium now, but with timing risk The three-year charter of Navios Destiny of Navios, interests of Angeliki Frangou, at $34,000 per day from Cosco shows that the company is selling market strength in the present, securing premium revenues for a vessel whose age under other conditions would pressure rates. From analysts’ perspective, this is clearly accretive for upcoming results and improves the short-term cash flow picture. However, timing matters. The question is not whether the deal is good today—because it is. It is whether, in 18 or 24 months, the market will be higher or lower than these levels. Navios appears to be choosing certainty over optionality. For Wall Street, this is neither right nor wrong. It is simply a clear stance on how it currently reads the container shipping cycle. Petros Panagiotidis’ reverse split In the language of Wall Street analysts, Robin Energy’s move constitutes an act of compliance. The 1:5 reverse split was not carried out to change the narrative, but to close a technical risk: the loss of the Nasdaq’s $1 minimum price requirement. With the stock at $0.71, the management of Petros Panagiotidis chose the most direct and institutionally acceptable path. The result—a price of $3.58—restores the relationship with the market without creating expectations that cannot be supported. The $1 million buyback that preceded it is read by funds as a signal of stabilization, not as an aggressive positioning. At the same time, the data from the LPG carriers provide what managers are looking for: cash-flow visibility. Contracts with well-known counterparties, locked-in revenues of more than $5.5 million, and coverage of 59% of days for 2026 are not impressive, but they reduce risk. That is exactly what is reflected in the models. Robin, a spin-off of Toro Corp, is not attempting a high-profile repositioning. It demonstrates discipline with market rules and a focus on operational performance, with the MR tanker following the seasonal improvement in charter rates. For institutional investors, the message is clear: no promises of capital gains, predictability, and remaining on the board. The first victim of 2026 will be the yen Hedge funds are very much like sharks. Once they smell blood, they rush to devour whatever is still alive. At this time, many hedge funds have taken positions against the Japanese yen at levels that strongly resemble the crisis of July 2024. More than 85,000 contracts of net short positions were recorded on December 14, betting on further weakening of the Japanese currency. It all starts with the interest-rate differential between the dollar and the yen, which today reaches as much as 3 percentage points. The Bank of Japan, despite the recent rate hikes it deemed necessary, is moving cautiously so as not to choke growth. The problem, however, lies in Japan’s real interest rates. They remain negative, since inflation is running faster than the BoJ’s rates. Those who hold yen-denominated accounts see their purchasing power eroding and are seeking more profitable deposit options. This is a classic déjà vu. Around this time last year, the dollar–yen exchange rate had exceeded 160, forcing the Ministry of Finance to proceed with immediate intervention to support the national currency. Some believe the same will happen this year. That is why they are taking short positions, expecting intervention. The U.S. stock market is flying. But not all of it… Everyone admires the U.S. stock indices, their resilience and momentum. But indices do not tell the whole truth. The 10 largest companies on Wall Street now account for 22% of global stock market capitalization. This is the highest level of the past 50 years. The top five alone reach 15%. It is a historic record. Goldman Sachs processed a chart of funding spreads that reveals the other side of the story. Professional investors are moving with extreme caution. Funding spreads are dropping sharply despite the upward course of the S&P 500. This divergence is a classic warning: when large institutional investors reduce their leverage even as the market rises, they are usually pricing in major turbulence. Concentration in a few stocks—the famous “Magnificent Seven” and a few more technology giants—creates the illusion of diversification. All investment advisors urge diversification: don’t put all your eggs in one basket, diversify your investment choices. An investor who thinks that by holding a global index ETF they are diversified, in reality has 22% of their exposure in just 10 companies. In roughly the same sector. Obviously, these 10 companies stand out today for their size and prospects. But if there is a sudden change of scenery, if something changes in laws and regulations, what will happen? Already today, investors in Artificial Intelligence companies are no longer satisfied with potential; they want concrete results after three years of gigantic investments. But what if those investments do not deliver as expected? What if something unforeseen happens? Explore related questions

Whether a bank has 1 branch or 100 branches, the very costly IT systems must be installed, supervisory capital must be available, and auditing procedures must be complete and operational. The game has started, and the efforts to capture market shares will be of exceptional interest. Teachers, police officers, and firefighters in Intralot A significant number of domestic mutual funds have taken positions in Intralot. As shown by the company’s shareholder register at the recent General Meeting, the largest positions are held by Alpha Bank and Optima mutual funds (Optima Greek Balanced, Optima Greek Equity) with approximately 6.6 million shares each; the National Asset Management mutual funds with approximately 5.6 million shares; while a significant position continues to be held by K. Antonopoulos, former CEO of the company, with approximately 9.2 million shares. Beyond that, there are smaller positions held by pension funds such as the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, funds for police officers and firefighters of New Jersey, mutual funds of Vanguard, Aviva, BlackRock, MorningStar, etc. Swiss franc: Who will ultimately say “yes” to the restructuring Banks have already started running their models for Swiss franc loans, as the new year brings developments. In about two months, borrowers will be called upon to decide whether they will join the restructuring, making a decision that will determine the course of their loan from now on. Banks are trying to determine the acceptance mix of the restructuring, since this is what will lead them to accurately calculate their provisions. According to banks’ estimates, those who can join the restructuring are borrowers without income criteria, and they will do so if their loan is not particularly mature. If, however, it is mature, given that their interest rate increases from 0% plus a 1% spread to 2.90%, they have no reason to do so. On the other hand, banks estimate that the greatest interest in the restructuring will come from those entitled to higher haircuts, based on income criteria. For this group, joining the restructuring may prove to be more attractive and a substantial relief, since the haircut reaches 50% and the interest rate 2.30%. However, a significant issue arises here: to what extent these particular borrowers can service the restructuring. It is worth highlighting an important advantage for many borrowers with a long repayment horizon: by converting the loan into euros, they essentially start from a point of departure where from then on they will see the outstanding balance of their loan gradually decrease—something that until now did not happen, due to the continuous appreciation of the Swiss franc. 25 listed companies have closed 280 meetings in Paris On January 29, 2026, a Thursday, the Piraeus Bank roadshow with companies listed on the Athens Exchange will finally take place at the famous Espace Cléry in Paris. Participation has already been locked in for 21 listed companies, and an impressively large number of one-on-one meetings with investors—more than 280—has been recorded. There is particular activity and interest for the “newcomers” to this institution, smaller-cap companies such as Profile, Alumil, AVAX, and Alter Ego. On the banking side, participation has already been confirmed (also with many meetings) by Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank, and Bank of Cyprus, followed by Metlen, Motor Oil, TITAN, OPAP, GEK TERNA, PPC, Athens International Airport, Cenergy, ELVALHALCOR, Aegean, HelleniQ Energy, Lamda Development, AVAX, KRI-KRI. Information indicates that the final number of participants will certainly reach 25, provided a sufficient number of one-on-one meetings is secured. Espace Cléry is an imposing, historic building in Paris’s 2nd arrondissement, in the heart of Sentier, and was once the residence of the famous painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. There, the 25 listed companies will paint the future of the Athens Stock Exchange… The background behind the shipping deals of the Greeks Greek shipowners continue to work quietly and methodically, letting their moves speak for themselves. During the festive period, the “hits” were many. On the newbuilding front, Aegean Bulk Co. Inc. closed four 82,000 dwt bulkers at Hengli Shipbuilding (Dalian), with deliveries in 2027–2028—a move read as a steady investment in capacity, without haste but with a clear horizon. At the same time, Cape Shipping shows it is not moving away from crude: one firm and one optional VLCC 319,000 dwt at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, for 2028, with scrubbers and a price around $119 million. Details matter here. In tankers, Capital Ship Management added two orders and two optional LR2/Aframax 114,000 dwt at Hengli, for delivery in 2028, discreetly strengthening its portfolio. V Group, on the other hand, opted for containers: two feeder 1,930 TEU at Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard, LNG dual-fuel, with deliveries 2028–2029. Those who follow the trends take notes. And in LPG, Benelux Overseas proceeded with two VLACs 93,000 cbm at HD Hyundai in South Korea, also dual-fuel, with delivery in 2028—a move showing persistence in a specific strategic path. In second-hand tonnage, the Greeks were not absent. The capesize ANTONIS ANGELICOUSSIS (177,855 dwt, 2007, Shanghai Waigaoqiao) changed hands at $20.5 million to Greek interests, while Oceanstar Management Inc. acquired the Ultramax IVS WINDSOR (60,279 dwt, 2016, Oshima) with cranes, for $26 million. At the same time, Greek-controlled vessels were also on the sellers’ side: the Handysize APHRODITE M (36,000 dwt, 2011, SPP) at $12.5 million, as well as the pair of Post-Panamax PORTO KAGIO and PORTO GERMENO (5,908 / 5,570 TEU, 2002, Koyo Dockyard), linked to Costamare, at $17 million each. The background shows that these are not spasmodic moves. Over the last twelve months, Greek interests count 132 new orders, 158 second-hand purchases, and 14 sales for recycling. As 2025 reached its end, the picture is clear: fleet renewal, careful choices, and a game played without noise but with clear targeting. Navios: Premium now, but with timing risk The three-year charter of Navios Destiny of Navios, interests of Angeliki Frangou, at $34,000 per day from Cosco shows that the company is selling market strength in the present, securing premium revenues for a vessel whose age under other conditions would pressure rates. From analysts’ perspective, this is clearly accretive for upcoming results and improves the short-term cash flow picture. However, timing matters. The question is not whether the deal is good today—because it is. It is whether, in 18 or 24 months, the market will be higher or lower than these levels. Navios appears to be choosing certainty over optionality. For Wall Street, this is neither right nor wrong. It is simply a clear stance on how it currently reads the container shipping cycle. Petros Panagiotidis’ reverse split In the language of Wall Street analysts, Robin Energy’s move constitutes an act of compliance. The 1:5 reverse split was not carried out to change the narrative, but to close a technical risk: the loss of the Nasdaq’s $1 minimum price requirement. With the stock at $0.71, the management of Petros Panagiotidis chose the most direct and institutionally acceptable path. The result—a price of $3.58—restores the relationship with the market without creating expectations that cannot be supported. The $1 million buyback that preceded it is read by funds as a signal of stabilization, not as an aggressive positioning. At the same time, the data from the LPG carriers provide what managers are looking for: cash-flow visibility. Contracts with well-known counterparties, locked-in revenues of more than $5.5 million, and coverage of 59% of days for 2026 are not impressive, but they reduce risk. That is exactly what is reflected in the models. Robin, a spin-off of Toro Corp, is not attempting a high-profile repositioning. It demonstrates discipline with market rules and a focus on operational performance, with the MR tanker following the seasonal improvement in charter rates. For institutional investors, the message is clear: no promises of capital gains, predictability, and remaining on the board. The first victim of 2026 will be the yen Hedge funds are very much like sharks. Once they smell blood, they rush to devour whatever is still alive. At this time, many hedge funds have taken positions against the Japanese yen at levels that strongly resemble the crisis of July 2024. More than 85,000 contracts of net short positions were recorded on December 14, betting on further weakening of the Japanese currency. It all starts with the interest-rate differential between the dollar and the yen, which today reaches as much as 3 percentage points. The Bank of Japan, despite the recent rate hikes it deemed necessary, is moving cautiously so as not to choke growth. The problem, however, lies in Japan’s real interest rates. They remain negative, since inflation is running faster than the BoJ’s rates. Those who hold yen-denominated accounts see their purchasing power eroding and are seeking more profitable deposit options. This is a classic déjà vu. Around this time last year, the dollar–yen exchange rate had exceeded 160, forcing the Ministry of Finance to proceed with immediate intervention to support the national currency. Some believe the same will happen this year. That is why they are taking short positions, expecting intervention. The U.S. stock market is flying. But not all of it… Everyone admires the U.S. stock indices, their resilience and momentum. But indices do not tell the whole truth. The 10 largest companies on Wall Street now account for 22% of global stock market capitalization. This is the highest level of the past 50 years. The top five alone reach 15%. It is a historic record. Goldman Sachs processed a chart of funding spreads that reveals the other side of the story. Professional investors are moving with extreme caution. Funding spreads are dropping sharply despite the upward course of the S&P 500. This divergence is a classic warning: when large institutional investors reduce their leverage even as the market rises, they are usually pricing in major turbulence. Concentration in a few stocks—the famous “Magnificent Seven” and a few more technology giants—creates the illusion of diversification. All investment advisors urge diversification: don’t put all your eggs in one basket, diversify your investment choices. An investor who thinks that by holding a global index ETF they are diversified, in reality has 22% of their exposure in just 10 companies. In roughly the same sector. Obviously, these 10 companies stand out today for their size and prospects. But if there is a sudden change of scenery, if something changes in laws and regulations, what will happen? Already today, investors in Artificial Intelligence companies are no longer satisfied with potential; they want concrete results after three years of gigantic investments. But what if those investments do not deliver as expected? What if something unforeseen happens? Explore related questions

Major Asian stock markets, including Tokyo and Seoul, were closed Wednesday for the yearend and New Year's holidays, while trading was mixed in those bourses that remained open. In China, the Hang Seng index dipped 0.9% to 25,630.54, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 3,969.75. The Taiex in Taiwan jumped 0.9% to 28,963.60. In Australia, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 dipped less than 0.1% to 8,714.30. Tokyo trading will be closed for the New Year's holidays on Thursday and Friday and is scheduled to reopen on Monday. In South Korea, trading will be closed on Thursday. Trading will remain open Wednesday on Wall Street but will be closed Thursday. Trading volume was thin Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 9.50 points, or 0.1%, to 6,894.24. Even with three straight days of small losses, the S&P 500 is on track for an annual gain of more than 17%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.87 points, or 0.2%, to 48,367.06. The Nasdaq composite fell 55.27 points, or 0.2%, to 23,419.08. The biggest weights on the market remained technology companies, especially those focused on advancements for artificial intelligence. Nvidia fell 0.4% and Apple fell 0.2%. Both companies have outsized values that have a greater overall impact on the market’s broader direction. On the winning side, Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.1%. The company is buying artificial intelligence startup Manus as it continues an aggressive push to amp up AI offerings across its platforms. The more notable action was in the commodities markets. The price of gold rose 1.4% to 4,386.30 per ounce. Silver prices gained 10.9%. Prices for gold and silver slumped Monday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the largest trading floors for commodities, asked traders to put up more cash to make bets on precious metals. Prices for both metals have surged in 2025 on a mix of economic worries and supply deficits. Copper rose 4.4% and is up more 40% for the year on strong demand. The base metal is critical to global energy infrastructure, and demand is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid. In energy trading, U.S. crude fell 7 cents to $57.88 per barrel. The price of Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 7 cents to $61.26 per barrel. Treasury yields were mixed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.12% from 4.11% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, held steady at 3.45% from late Monday. Overall, Treasury yields have fallen significantly through the year, partly because of the market's expectations for a shift in interest rate policy at the Fed. The central bank cut interest rates three times late in 2025, most recently at its meeting earlier in December. The central bank has been dealing with a more complex economic picture. Consumer confidence has been weakening throughout the year as inflation squeezes consumers and businesses. The continued impact of a wide-ranging U.S.-led trade war threatens to add more fuel to inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly high while the jobs market slows down. The Fed can cut interest rates to help the economy weather a slower jobs market. But that could add more fuel to inflation, which is still solidly above the Fed's 2% target. Hotter inflation could stunt economic growth. The Fed has signaled more caution moving forward. Minutes from its December meeting reflect the divisions within the central bank as it deals with uncertainty about the threats facing the economy. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its next meeting in January. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 156.60 Japanese yen from 156.36 yen. The euro cost $1.1740, little changed from $1.1744. AP Business Writer Damian J. Troise contributed to this report.

Title: Out of the Greenhouse and Into the Madhouse: the Year in Climate Politics

Mill, Westport, Oregon. Photo: Jeffrey St. Clair. 2025 will go down as the second or third hottest year on record. The last decade has been the hottest decade in human history. Driven by drought and extreme winds, a massive fire burned its way across the LA Basin, incinerating more than 10,000 homes. The estimated damage ranges from $76 billion to $133 billion. Total losses to businesses and workers in income and wages totaled at least $297. The year saw two of the largest, most rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the history of the Atlantic Ocean. Floods in central Texas killed at least 137 people, while massive flooding driven by twin cyclones that tore across Sumatra and the southern Philippines killed at least 1,800 people and left more than a million people homeless. We are in the midst of the largest mass coral bleaching event in history, affecting 83% of the world’s extant coral reefs. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is accelerating. Its surface is fracturing, causing massive ice falls and rockslides that are warping the southern continent’s geology. A total collapse of the ice sheet, which now seems certain, would raise global sea levels by 12 feet. The Arctic Ocean is now expected to be “ice-free” in the summer by 2030, twenty years earlier than predicted just a few years ago. The Atlantic Current is slowing down and may be on the verge of collapse, which would likely destabilize rainfall patterns for much of the planet. Wildfires in Canada now burn year-round. There were 24,000 heat-related deaths in Europe this summer from June to August alone. Deaths from extreme heat in the US have increased by more than 50% since 2000. None of these catastrophic events has left the slightest impact on Trump, who has ordered his administration to slash nearly every restraint on the release of CO2 into the atmosphere. Oil drilling has been expanded on federal lands (including the high Arctic) and waters. The dying industry of coal mining has been put on life support with new subsidies and exemptions from environmental regulations, while coal-generating power plants slated for closure have been forced to keep operating. Large-scale renewable energy projects, in the planned for years, have been cancelled and tax credits and incentives for small-scale solar have been gutted. Energy-hogging data centers have been fast-tracked and freed from regulatory constraints. Prior to Trump’s re-inauguration, Bethany Kozma — who now heads RFK’s Department of Health and Human Services Office of Global Affairs— vowed that the administration “will have to eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere” in government. And they’ve largely followed through gutting NOAA’s Office of Atmospheric Research; the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, National Center for Atmospheric Research, U.S. Global Change Research program and NASA’s Earth Science program. Climate research stations have been shuttered. References to climate change have been removed from federal websites, documents, databases and signage on federal lands, offices and parks. And it’s not just Trump. The supposed global protectors of the climate had their annual meeting in Bélem, Brazil this year and likely generated more CO2 coming and going from the confab than they saved during the sessions. That’s in part because they came and went without even mentioning fossil fuels in their final document. These actions go beyond denial and amount to incitement of the wrath of the climate gods. Their vengeance will be a terrible thing to behold. We’ve gone from trying to survive in a global greenhouse into a madhouse.–JSC January Pacific Palisades fire from a flight leaving LAX. (Screengrab from video posted to X.) “The climate crisis reveals that our civilization has never really been organized around science, contrary to the usual Enlightenment narrative. It is organized around capital. Science is embraced when it serves the interests of capital and is often ignored when it does not.” – Jason Hickle There’s nothing so terrifying as a nightmare come to life. The Santa Ana winds have haunted the dreams of southern Angelinos for decades. Like the Chinooks of the Rockies and the Mistrals of the Rhone Valley, these winds play on the mind. They tell you they’re coming for you. They whisper the dangers they bring with them. Van Gogh believed the mistral inflamed his madness. Another kind of madness seems to be inflicting LA, the madness of boundless consumption. Some listen to the warnings of the wind. Some don’t. Those who listen are driven mad by those who don’t. In the chaparrals of southern California, the warning of the Santa Anas has always been: fire. Fires that race down hillsides and canyons faster than any Tesla can drive. Fires that leap roads, highways, malls. Fires that ride on the wind. This is not new. The Santa Ana winds come with the territory–that territory being the desert basins behind the coastal mountains and canyons. They are katabatic winds that rush downhill, dry and fierce, as they pour through the Cajon, San Gorgonio, and Soledad passes. Geography makes them. Climate change and a rapacious real estate industry that has remained deaf to their message have turned them into killers. Historically, the Santa Anas (ponder the resonance of that name in our time of mass xenophobia) are autumn winds, warm winds that carry the dust of the Mojave. Now, Santa Anas can erupt any time of year. That’s climate change, for you. Yet a threat that is omnipresent often seems somehow less ominous, making it more likely to catch you off guard. Even so, LA wasn’t entirely taken by surprise this week. They had two days to get ready. The Santa Anas create the conditions for catastrophic fires on their own. They are fire-making weather events that dry out already parched landscapes, lowering the humidity and raising the temperature as they blow through. On November 13, 2008, 50-mile-per-hour Santa Ana winds whipped up a bonfire started by college students into an inferno that spread across neighborhoods in Montecito and Santa Barbara. The Tea Fire burned for three days, destroying 210 homes. Then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger described the charred landscape as “looking like Hell.” The next day, the still-roaring winds, gusting to 80—mph, supercharged a fire in the Santa Clarita Valley that ravaged the town of Sylmar. The Sayre fire burned for a week and destroyed more than 600 buildings, including 480 mobile homes. We don’t know how this week’s fires originated—cigarette, campfire, truck spark, downed power line, or arson. But the Hollywood Hills, Santa Monica, and San Gabriel Mountains were already primed to burn. Chapparal is born in fire and thrives in it. In their natural state, the chappal landscapes of southern California experience low-intensity fires once every 20 to 50 years. After a couple of relatively wet years, the southern California coast has now flipped back into drought conditions. It hasn’t experienced any measurable rainfall in eight months. Climate change has made southern California drier, increasing the frequency and intensity of the region’s natural fire regime. Even fully functioning fire hydrants will never replace the amount of moisture climate change has stolen from the ecosystem. They talk about the “urban-wildland” interface. In So Cal, that interface is under relentless siege as new luxury homes, condos, and “mixed-use” buildings creep inexorably up the hillsides and canyons, undeterred by the rugged geography, faultlines, or flammability. The boundaries between the natural and the manufactured have been shredded, both on the ground and in the atmosphere. The buffer zones are gone and now nothing is standing between you and the wind. Yes, you were warned. But no number of red flags could really fortify you for what was coming; no amount of preparation at this late stage could save you from hundred-mile-per-hour winds from a hurricane of fire. Even palaces burn. Pacific Palisades fire. (Screengrab from video posted to X.) +++ + You don’t have to be versed in Mike Davis’s The Ecology of Fear to understand that the people who always pay the heaviest price for these kinds of cataclysms in So. Cal–even in elite zip codes like Pac Palisades–aren’t Hollywood moguls or hedge funders, but LA’s mostly brown and black working poor… + In 2019, Eric Garcetti, then the mayor of Los Angeles, told David Wallace-Wells: “There’s no number of helicopters or trucks that we can buy, no number of firefighters that we can have, no amount of brush that we can clear that will stop this. The only thing that will stop this is when the Earth, probably long after we’re gone, relaxes into a more predictable weather state.” + An initial estimate from AccuWeather Inc. puts the total cost of the LA fires at between $52 billion and $57 billion, making it the most expensive fire event in history. + In July, State Farm, one of the biggest insurers in California, canceled 1600 homeowner policies in Pacific Palisades. A year earlier, the same insurance company had dropped more than 2,000 policies in the nearby neighborhoods of Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, and Monte Nido, all of which have now been ravaged by devastating wildfires. But the big insurers who have canceled policies for homeowners and businesses in climate-vulnerable states continue to insure the fossil fuel industries that make people’s homes uninsurable. + 19 of the 20 largest fires in California history have ignited since 2000… + Environmental historian Stephen J. Pyne, author of Fire in America: “If we keep fighting a war with fire, three things are going to happen. We’re going to spend a lot of money, we’re going to take a lot of casualties, and we’re going to lose.” + Mike Davis: ‘The loss of more than 90 percent of Southern California’s agricultural buffer zone is the principal if seldom mentioned reason wildfires increasingly incinerate such spectacular swathes of luxury real estate.” + It’s worth noting that one of the reasons California likes to keep its prisons as full as possible is that inmates make up around 30% of the state’s firefighting force. For risking their lives on the firelines, prisoners are paid between 16¢ to 74¢ an hour (maxxing out at $5.80 to $10.24 a day) and rewarded with a bologna sandwich and an apple for lunch on the job. + When there’s a mass shooting, the response from MAGA is “thoughts and prayers.” When there’s a climate-driven cataclysm, the response is: “Drill, baby, drill, rake, baby, rake, and log, baby, log.” The LA fires will be used as Trump’s Reichstag fire against environmental regulations. + He’s deliriously wrong about everything in this post, except for the incompetence of Gavin Newsom, a preening servant of the real estate and energy industries. + President Empathy struts his stuff one more time… + If Biden keeps this up, he may be destined to end his presidency less popular than Trump was after Jan. 6, 2021. + Norman Maclean, Young Men and Fire: “In this story of the outside world and the inside world with a fire between, the outside world of little screwups recedes now for a few hours to be taken over by the inside world of blowups, this time by a colossal blowup but shaped by little screwups that fitted together tighter and tighter until all became one and the same thing–the fateful blowup.” + In 2000, the global warming trend predicted the world would hit 1.5C warming in 2041. It happened in 2024. + According to a new study by Aurora Energy Research, rescinding the Inflation Reduction Act’s technology-neutral clean energy tax credits could increase Americans’ electricity bills by 10%. Some states, like Texas, could see increases of more than 20%. + Last year, the European Union imported more Russian LNG than ever. + The Federal Trade Commission announced that crude oil producers XCL Resources Holdings, LLC (XCL), Verdun Oil Company II LLC (Verdun), and EP Energy LLC (EP) will pay a record $5.6 million civil penalty for illegal coordination that led to a crude oil supply shortage. Before merging, the crude oil companies started working together, limiting the oil supply when the US faced shortages and inflated prices. + As more green power plants have gone online, German gas imports dropped by 11% in 2024. + After the first week of congestion pricing in NYC, the commute times into Manhattan were cut in half…. +++ Drone image of Pacific Palisades. Number of destroyed or severely damaged buildings in LA (so far): 20,000 Population of LA County: 10 million Number of destroyed or severely damaged buildings in Gaza (so far): 80,000 Population of Gaza: 2.1 million + In only five days, the Pacific Palisades fire destroyed more structures (> 12,500) than any fire in California history, except the Camp Fire of 2018, which burned for 18 days. + In the 1980s, the US experienced around three weather-related disasters that caused more than $1 billion in damages. Now, the average is around 18 a year. (NOAA) + More than 1000 incarcerated people are out fighting LA’s fires, but their families aren’t allowed to contact them to see if they’re safe. + Jason Oppenheim, owner of the celebrity real estate firm featured on Selling Sunset, told the BBC that his clients are being price gouged in post-fire LA. One landlord was asking $13,000/month, but when his client went to rent the home, the landlord demanded $23,000. Welcome to the club…Meanwhile, California State Attorney General Rob Bonta said that his office has received numerous reports of hotels and rental properties in southern California increasing their prices by more than 10%, which violates the state’s anti-price gouging law. According to the LA Times, the asking price for single-family homes in the Los Angeles area are being listed for nearly 20% higher since the wildfires started. + Florida’s state residual insurance plan is on the hook for $525 billion in losses, twice the amount in 2022, while California’s state insurer faces $290 billion in liabilities, a sixfold increase from 2018. Thirty-six states now have residual insurance plans, but 21 of the states don’t explain how they will pay when the liabilities overwhelm their assets. + A report by researchers at the University of Colorado and the University of Wisconsin-Madison estimates that three-fourths of homeowners may not have enough insurance to fully cover losses after a disaster. + Shed a few tears for the investment bankers of So Cal, one of whom shelled out $27 million to buy a now incinerated mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Beach.’ He told Fortune that he only expects $3 million from insurance. He’ll probably write the loss off on his taxes for the next decade, assuming he’s paying any. + The New York Post reported on Wednesday that Los Angeles landlords have increased rents by as much as 124% after the wildfires. + Here’s a spreadsheet tracking rental price-gouging by landlords in LA County… + Potential insurance exposure to the Los Angeles fires is $458 billion. The state’s FAIR insurance program only has $700 million cash on hand to pay claims. + From Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism: Out of approximately 700 homes destroyed in the 2020 Santa Cruz Mountains Lightning Complex Fire, only 95 have been rebuilt and occupied 4 years later, with only 158 more in construction. Nearly two-thirds are not being rebuilt. + The top five least affordable metro areas in the US are all in California.

On average, about 1.4 million acres burn a year.” July Still from aerial footage of the Texas floods aired by CNN. While offering his “thoughts and prayers” for the families of those drowned in the Texas floods, JD Vance referred to the killer torrents that swept away more than 100 people, including dozens of children, as “an incomprehensible tragedy.” “Incomprehensible?” Only if you ignore the fact that the Girls Camp was allowed to be built and continue operating in one of the most flood-prone valleys in the US, that the climate crisis is making these floods much more frequent and then in order to give more tax breaks to billionaires you gutted the staff of the National Weather Service that could have given these vulnerable children warning of the imminent danger that would claim their lives …If you don’t ignore these facts, this tragedy was both entirely predictable and avoidable. Trump put his own self-exculpating spin on the floods, saying they were impossible to foresee: “Nobody expected it. Nobody saw it.” In fact, almost anyone who knew the slightest thing about the area known as “Flood Alley” saw it coming. Because it had already come, more than once. Previous recent floods had killed 10 people in 1987, 31 people in 1998 and 26 people in 2015. The denuded hill country of central Texas contains some of the most flood-prone valleys in the United States. The Guadeloupe River was so flood-prone that the Kerr County sheriff had recommended installing a flash flood warning system back in 2016. And the Obama administration agreed to the request, only to have the Texas Division of Environmental Management refuse the offer. Climate change has made the extreme rainfall episodes that have plagued this region of Texas for decades even more frequent and more lethal. In central Texas, the intensity of extreme rainfall events has increased by 19% since 1985. Climate change has made the extreme rainfall episodes that have plagued this region of Texas for decades even more frequent and more lethal. In central Texas, the intensity of extreme rainfall events has increased by 19% since 1985. “Generally, extreme rainfall is intensifying at a rate of 7 percent with each degree Celsius of atmospheric warming. But recent studies indicate that so-called record-shattering events are increasing at double that rate,” Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA told the New York Times. On July 3, remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which had whacked the gulf coast of Mexico earlier in the week, settled over central Texas, eventually dumping four months of rainfall on the Texas Hill Country (about 1.8 trillion gallon) in the next three days. That afternoon, the depleted ranks of the National Weather Service issued its first alert, warning of flash floods in the Guadalupe River valley, predicting rainfall totals of more than 6 inches in 12 hours. The predictions were made by a seriously understaffed NWS office in San Antonio, which lacked both a chief meteorologist and a warning coordination meteorologist. It’s not just the NWS that finds itself overworked and understaff as the warming climate unleashes stronger and stronger storms. The slashes to NOAA’s budget and staffing are going to dangerously degrade accurate and timely predictions of the threats posed by tropical storms, cyclones and hurricanes. According to Dr. Frank Marks, a 45-year hurricane veteran, the staff needed to fly NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is down by 50% this year. This initial forecast proved to be a fatal underestimation and the emergency alert, urging residents to evacuate to higher ground (though how high that ground was and whether it was high enough remains unclear) didn’t come out until 4:30 in the morning. By 6:AM, it was too late, the river was already flowing at record flood levels. More than 20 inches of rain would fall on the Guadalupe Valley watershed in the next three days, causing the river to surge from 3.5 feet to 34.29 feet in less than an hour and a half, sweeping away houses, bridges, barns, roads, farm animals and at least 120 people (173 remain missing), including as many as 27 young girls and counselors at Camp Mystic, the summer camp for evangelical girls. Most of the cabins at the camp, run for years by Conservative Christians, were located in flood zones, some in areas label “extreme risk.” In 2019, the owners of the camp completed a multi-million dollar renovation. But instead of moving the most vulnerable cabins out of the flood zone, it built more cabins inside it. Anna Serra-Lobet, a flood risk researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, told the New York Times that allowing these cabins to be built in extreme risk “floodways” was “like pitching a tent in a highway. It’s going to happen, sooner or later. A car is going to come or a flood is going to come.” Texas Governor Gregg Abbott didn’t waste much time in urging a socialist response to the disaster, as he begged Trump for immediate help. The emergency aid wasn’t quick in coming, however. Indeed, FEMA’s response to the Texas floods was crippled by cost controls imposed on the agency by DHS head Kristi Noem, who didn’t authorize FEMA’s deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams until Monday, more than 72 hours after the flooding began. Still Abbott rejected calls for an investigation into the lack of warnings and the bungled rescue operations, calling it “words of losers.” He presumably wasn’t talking about those who “lost” their lives and loved ones, though who knows given the hair-chested rhetoric he customarily deploys. Days went by, as the death toll continued to mount, without a single word from Trump and Noem’s pick to head FEMA, David Richardson, prompting a FEMA staffer to denounce Richardson for showing “a lack of regard in disaster response, and a lack of care for communities that suffer through these disasters.” As for Noem, she fired contract workers at FEMA emergency centers a day after the flooding started, leaving thousands of calls for help unanswered in the middle of the crisis… At his press conference in Texas, Trump said that anyone who criticized the response to the floods was a “bad person.” So, Heckuva job, Puppy Slayer! +++ + Five years from now, we’ll long for the cool June of 2025… + Rep.

It covers 2/3 of the nation, in which 80% of the country’s population over the 7-day heatwave period will hit 90+ for a high temperature (~260 million people). The peak intensity of the heat dome was record-breaking for the SE US in late July. It peaked at 3.7 standard deviations, based on statistics from the past climate records we have, which means this heat dome is rare, if not virtually impossible, in our former climate of the 1900s. But human-caused climate change now makes these extreme heat domes much more likely. From the climate scientists at World Weather Attribution: ‘Every heatwave in the world is now made stronger and more likely to happen because of human-caused climate change.’ + According to the energy statistics group Ageb, German hard coal-fired power generation increased by 23.3% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. + A new study from the UK finds that being hit by an SUV (as compared to a regular car) “considerably” increases the risk of death for children, and even more so for young children. + Marine heat waves in 2023 covered at least 96% of the Earth’s oceans and lasted four times longer than normal. The heat waves of 2024 were just as bad. + The 2025 fire season in Canada is already the third worst in history and will almost certainly become the second worst. A study from 2018 found that over the last six decades, the fire season in Canada is starting one week earlier and ending one week later. The fire season is likely even longer now. + India is on track to meet its 2030 renewable targets and will exceed the US in the deployment of new wind and solar generators this year. + Trump in Scotland this week: “And the other thing I say to Europe: we will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They’re killing us. They’re killing the beauty of our scenery. Our beautiful plains. I’m not talking about airplanes… they won’t let you bury the propellers.” + Under its most conservative estimates, the Department of Energy says the US needs to build 5,000 miles of new transmission lines a year to transport renewable power across state lines. In 2024, the entire US built 322 miles of them. + Only 474 out of more than 90,000 oil slicks from ships around the world were reported to authorities over a five-year period–that’s less than 0.5 percent. Carrie O’Reilly, marine ecologist at Florida State: “Even trace quantities of oil are damaging to planktonic organisms, which form the base of the marine food web”. + Bruno Maçães: “Stunning to look at Europe today: if China sells us ultra cheap solar panels, effectively subsiding our energy transition, that’s the threat of autocracy. If the US uses coercion and blackmail to sink our economies, that’s working together.” + Trump has almost completely deregulated the fossil fuel industry in the US, but his pals on Wall Street don’t seem to be buying it. The financing of new oil, gas and coal projects by the six largest banks has dropped by 25% percent, as compared to the last year of the Biden administration. Morgan-Stanely’s financing of fossil fuels fell by 54%. + A new study published in Science finds that breathing polluted air increases the risk of osteoporosis. +++ Meteorologist Jeff Beradelli on the explosive growth of Hurricane Erin: Hurricane Erin achieved something most storms do not this weekend. “Extreme Rapid Intensification”. Did climate change play a part? Science says, yes. In 12 hours winds increased by ~65 mph. Only 3 other storms have done that and Erin was the earliest & only August storm to do so. Also, there was a 78 mb drop in 24 hours, a feat only achieved by 2 other storms since 1980, and those were both in October (Milton & Wilma). Erin was the 5th earliest cat 5 on record. The image below shows that water temps in the vicinity of the Rapid Intensification (RI) were almost 2F above normal, hot waters made much more likely by climate change. In fact, studies show episodes of Rapid Intensification (esp. extreme RI) have increased significantly over the past few decades as waters have warmed. RI has increased by almost 5 mph per decade over the past 40 years. That means that a storm – which in the 1980s – had a RI of 40 mph in 24 hours, would likely have an RI of 60 mph in 24 hours now (on average). That makes storms much more destructive (if they landfall of course) It’s not coincidence, it’s climate change. Now, worth mentioning you need a whole lot more than hot water for a cat 5 & RI – all factors must line up – but if they do, hotter than normal water makes it much more possible. + Meteorologist John Morales: “The rapid intensification threshold is 35 mph in 24 hours. For extreme rapid intensification, it’s 58 mph in 24 hours. Erin saw an 85 mph gain in max windspeed in 24 hrs. By barometric pressure, it is a top-20 strongest Atlantic hurricane.” + From a disturbing new report in Nature on the “abrupt changes” going on down in the Antarctic: “A regime shift has reduced Antarctic sea-ice extent far below its natural variability of past centuries, and in some respects is more abrupt, non-linear and potentially irreversible than Arctic sea-ice loss.” “The tipping point for unstoppable ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be exceeded even under best-case CO2emission reduction pathways, potentially initiating global tipping cascades.” + What AI data centers have done to your electricity bill: prices in the US are up 38% in the last 5 years, after being stable for the previous 5 years. + A study in Nature found glaciers in the Alps and Pyrenees mountains of Europe have lost about 40% of their mass since 2000. 2022 and 2023 set new records for percentage of ice loss. + The Mediterreanean is becoming a tropical sea. With water temperatures of 32C, these warming water have encouraged hundreds of species native to the Red Sea, such as the lionfish, to invade the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. The consequences to the sea’s ecosystems could be devastating. Heatmap: “From 2020 to 2023, the average American breathed in concentrations of smoke-related PM2.5 that were between 2.6 and 6.7 times higher than the 2006 to 2019 average.” + Former NOAA scientist Holden Harris, whose doctorate was funded by the National Science Foundation, on life after being fired by the Trump Administration: “Today, among my four part-time and consulting jobs, I sell frozen chocolate bananas on the beach in Jacksonville Beach. That cannot be the best return on taxpayer investment.” September + On Tuesday, California was hit by more than 10,000 lightning strikes in less than 24-hours, igniting wildfires up and down the state. + China currently has 339 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity under construction, that’s nearly two-thirds of the world’s existing capacity. +There’s a reason for this… + The data center for Zuckerberg’s Meta, now under construction outside Cheyenne, Wyoming, will consume more power than all of the homes in the Cowboy State. + Trump’s Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, got brutally fact-checked on Elon Musk’s own platform this week for his inane deprecations about solar energy… + Nicholas Fulghum, Senior Energy and Climate Data Analyst at Ember Energy: “Covering the planet in solar panels would produce around 150-200 million TWh of electricity a year. That is 1,000x more than the global primary energy consumption of ~180,000 TWh. There’s wrong and then there’s @SecretaryWright wrong, who is LEADING THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.” + There are two options here: Wright destroyed a lot of brain cells when he drank fracking fluid to prove it was “safe.” Or he’s just lying. Probably both. + A bracing new report in Nature warns that the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon may be exhausted much sooner than thought: “Researchers report that Earth can safely store around 1,460 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO₂) — a number much lower than the 10,000–40,000 GtCO₂ often cited in previous studies.” + According to OXFAM, the deepening drought in East Africa is worse than the one that devastated the region in 2011, when huge herds of cattle, sheep and goats were completely wiped out and 750,000 people perished from starvation and lack of water. Herder Mahmoud Ciroobey from Kalsheikh in Somaliland: This drought is slowly killing everything. First, it “swept away” the land and the pastures; then it “swept away” the animals, which first became weaker and weaker and eventually died. Soon, it is going to “sweep away” people. People are sick with flu, diarrhoea, and measles. If they don’t get food, clean water, and medicines, they will die like their animals. + Decade after decade, the dry season in the Amazon rainforest has been getting longer and drier. A new study published in Nature Communicationsfound that about 75 percent of the decrease in rainfall is directly linked to deforestation. In the first six months of 2025, Brazilian officials reported a 27 percent increase in tree loss nationwide over the same period last year. + The air quality in Squamish, British Columbia (30 miles north of Vancouver) hit 800 on Wednesday. An AQI between 200 and 300 is considered “very unhealthy. An AQI above 300 is considered “hazardous.” An AQI of 800 is almost unbreathable. + Air pollution generated by the oil and gas industry causes more than 90,000 premature deaths across the US each year and results in hundreds of thousands of cases of childhood asthma and more than 10,000 incidents of premature birth annually, according to a new study by researchers at University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute. Moreover, the report found that the burden falls disproportionately on the poor and communities of color. + + Realtor Climate Risk Report: “More than one in four U.S. homes—amounting to $12.7 trillion in real estate—faces at least one type of severe or extreme climate risk, like floods, hurricanes, and wildfires.” + Trump’s EPA is preparing to stop collecting toxic emissions data from air polluters, which is going to end up killing a lot more people a year than mass shooters, even here in the home of mass shooters. + Last year, Burgum’s home state of North Dakota produced 35% of its energy from wind power. + Apparently, they’ve forgotten all about how to store energy and the batteries containing the rare earth minerals they’re arm-twisting countries across to acquire? + Even as Trump is doing everything he can to shut it down, congestion pricing in NYC has succeeded in reducing vehicle traffic into Manhattan by 12%, meaning almost 18 million fewer vehicles trips since it went into effect. + Trump at the UN General Assembly: Climate change it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you’re involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that cost their country’s fortunes and given those same countries, no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. + The Trump administration has ordered the National Park Service to begin removing signage about slavery, climate change and the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II. “This is an outrageous assault on our free speech and ability to educate each other,” charged Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat from Maine. “It’s just bonkers to me that the federal government is imposing these kinds of restraints, that we’re taking away valuable information from our citizens who visit this park, and that we are trying to dumb everyone down and pretend real weather events don’t happen by not letting you read a simple sign.” October + This month, Trump’s team launched a coordinated assault on renewable energy. + Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Fox: “We’re announcing today expanded programs to help the American coal industry. We’re helping it because for years it has been under assault. It was out of fashion with the chardonnay set in San Francisco, Boulder, Colorado, and New York City … coal just makes the world go round.” + Bailing out a dying industry that has killed and sickened 10s of thousands of workers and the atmosphere… + Coal power peaked in the US in 2007. Wind and solar power overtook it in 2024. + EPA director Lee Zeldin on why renewable energy is bad: “Those battery storage sites cost a whole lot of money, and they then catch on fire and these local municipalities, fire departments, they aren’t prepared for those massive fires that end up resulting and those environmental impacts.” + Interior Secretary Doug Burgum: “There was just a report out — all of these European wind companies, they’ve had a wind drought … All of those European companies are reporting earnings below expectations because the wind didn’t blow as hard this summer as they expected it to do.” + A new study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that: “A broad shift to electric vehicles — which are quieter than traditional vehicles — could yield noise reduction benefits of $77.3 billion, concentrated among low-income families in dense urban areas.” + Bloomberg News reports that “wholesale electricity costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers. That’s being passed on to customers.” + Only 38% of the California homes lost to fire in the last ten years have been rebuilt. +++ + Since the year 2000, nearly 78% of the planet has set new records for all-time maximum monthly temperatures. At least 38% were set in the last five years alone. + The Energy Department has added “emissions” and “climate change” to its banned words list. Too bad George Carlin isn’t around to expound upon the 1,723 words you can’t say in the Trump Administration… + Chinese electric vehicles, which are priced thousands of dollars less than US and European models, now account for more than half of all global EV sales, + Carbon offsets are a corporate scam that hasn’t worked and never will work. Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School: We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale. We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed. + The latest evidence that the ocean ecosystems are dying: Since June, around 400 marine mammals have washed up sick or dead on California’s Central Coast since June from leptospirosis, toxic algal blooms and a collapsing food chain. These numbers, records though they are, are almost certainly a vast undercount, since most of the deaths go unnoticed. + Despite spiking demand, Nevada has seen the lowest electric utility price increases in the nation over the last twenty years (just +1.4%), owing largely to its massive investment in solar power. + A new report submitted to the UK government by its climate advisors warns that “heatwaves will occur in at least four out of every five years in England by 2050, and time spent in drought will double. The number of days of peak wildfire conditions in July will nearly triple for the UK…with some peak river flows increasing by 40%.” + With his customary perverse sense of timing, Trump posted this rubbish on the same day one of the most powerful hurricanes in the history of the Atlantic Ocean trashed Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba, killing dozens, perhaps hundreds, and took direct aim at the Bahamas… + Luke de Noronha on Hurricane Melissa’s ferocious landfall in Jamaica: ‘Shana texted me: ‘I can hear trees breaking and zinc flying. The wind sounds like it’s talking.’ On the videos people sent, it sounded more like screeching. Chris: ‘An almond tree broke in half next door. It was three storeys high.’” + Amitav Ghosh on Earth after the climate apocalypse: “The notion of anticipatory ruination has implications that extend far beyond Bangladesh: in a sense, it has now become a plan for the future of the entire planet.” + As Trump calls for a halt to solar installations, Texas has forged ahead. In the last five years, electricity demand on the Texas grid (ERCOT) has grown by 20 percent. But emissions have fallen by 7% over the same period. Why? Because according to the Energy Information Agency, nearly all of the demand has been met by renewables: wind, batteries and, especially, solar. + According to a survey by the University of Chicago, only 52% of Americans believe in human-caused climate change, a drop from 55% in 2017. Belief among Democrats has fallen 5 points since then, while belief among Republicans has grown by 9 points and, among Independents, by 16 points. (42 percent of young Republicans now believe in anthropogenic warming, logging only slightly behind the rest of the country.) + North Dakota is the only state in the US that has seen its electricity prices fall since 2019. Could that be because in the last six years, the Flickertail State has seen: – Solar generation increased by 425% – Wind generation increased by 34% – Coal generation fell by 8% + Carbon reduction plans submitted to the UN by more than 60 countries would reduce global emissions by a mere 10 percent, far below the goals set in the Paris Climate Accords or needed to slow runaway climate change. + A Lawrence Livermore / Berkeley study estimates that about 40 percent of California’s electricity price increase over the last five years was due to wildfire-related costs. November +++ + Obviously, not “our” people, so no cause for alarm… + Since 1997, there’s been a 2.7% decline in annual rainfall in the US, while extreme flooding events have dramatically increased, according to new research from AccuWeather. + According to a study by researchers at the World Inequality Lab, the wealthiest 1 percent of the global population accounts for 15% of all emissions attributed to consumers, but when their carbon footprint is measured by the assets they own, their share jumps up to about 40 percent. + A new paper published in Energy Research and Social Science found that the 2022 energy crisis drove record global profits for fossil fuel companies: “We estimate that globally, the net income in publicly-listed oil and gas companies alone reached $916 billion in 2022, with the US the biggest beneficiary, with claims on $301 billion, more than US investments of $267 billion investment in low-carbon energy economy that year.” Half of profits went to the top 1 percent, mainly through stock ownership. + CNBC: I could see a Democratic president declaring a climate emergency to tax countries with high CO2 emissions. Does that concern you at all what Democrats might do with this type of tariff power? Scott Bessent: I would question whether there’s a climate emergency. It’s all been proven wrong. + Elon Musk, disputing Trump’s assertion that solar energy is “a scam to make your country fail”: “Just with solar alone, China can, in 18 months, produce enough solar panels to power all the electricity of the United States.” + Though fossil fuels still dominate, the percentage of the planet’s energy derived from fossil fuels edged down again in 2024 and is now at the lowest level since the 1960s. + Battery capacity by power grid in the US: CAISO (California): 14,609 MW ERCOT (Texas): 10,982 MW PJM (Mid-Atlantic): 441 MW + Since April 13, 2025, Nepal has recorded 4,597 weather/climate-related disaster incidents nationwide. A total of 335 people have died, 41 are missing, and 1,264 have been injured, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. + Lyndi Stone, a principal corporate counsel for Microsoft, on the problem with siting data centers: Nobody really wants a data center in their backyard, I don’t want a data center in my backyard…. Data centers, once they’re operational, don’t bring a lot of jobs. +++ + Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement will rise around 1.1% in 2025, reaching a record 38.1 billion tonnes of CO2, according to the latest figures from the Global Carbon Project. + A new study published in Nature finds broad support globally for decisive action to combat climate change: “Our findings reveal widespread support for climate action. Notably, 69% of the global population expresses a willingness to contribute 1% of their personal income, 86% endorse pro-climate social norms and 89% demand intensified political action.” + In the last 13 years, electric vehicle sales in Norway have gone from less than 5% to 95% of all cars and trucks sold in the country. + Today, almost 3/4 of EU electricity generation comes from non-fossil energy sources. + Solar now accounts for around 90 percent of all new energy growth, globally. Global solar grew by 498 TWh (+31%) in Q1-Q3 2025, compared to 2024, “the largest increase ever over a nine-month period.” Global solar output in the first three quarters of 2025 already eclipsed the total output in all of 2024. + China’s CO2 emissions have now been flat or falling for 18 months. + The draft text coming out of COP30 in Belém dropped a provision calling for a global plan to move away from fossil fuels. In fact, the elides all mentions of fossil fuels. What’s the point? + The amount of carbon dioxide emitted getting to and from the climate summits is now officially more than the amount of carbon dioxide reduced by the summits. + This is the 29th year in a row that Greenland has lost more ice than it gained. For the past four years, rainfall has been recorded at Greenland’s northernmost point. + Trump on climate change at Saudi/US Investment conference: ” I’m all for climate change… It’s climate change that’s destroying the world, remember? The world was supposed to have been gone two years ago. The world was gonna burn up, but it actually got much cooler. It’s a little conspiracy. We have to investigate them immediately. They probably are being investigated.” +South Africa’s solar panel imports increased by 60% in the last 12 months, led by South Africa and followed by 20 other countries. Meanwhile, India has now hit its goal of 50% clean energy, five years ahead of the target date. + In 2008, climate models predicted the world would pass 1.5 °C of warming in 2048. Today, the best estimate is 2029. + After pushback from the real estate industry, “Zillow “quietly removed” climate risk estimates from over one million listings… + Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro, the genocide defender many Democratic Party elites want to run for president in 2028, pulled his state out of a climate pactmany other Blue states, including Virginia, under new governor Abigail Stanberger, have joined… + The Guardian on the rapid depletion of the planet’s groundwater: “Groundwater poverty has become one of the major issues in climate change, with cities throughout the world sinking through a combination of frequent droughts, heavy stormwater running off without replenishing the underwater storage and megacities drawing too much Artesian water. It is a problem which immediately affects large centres of population, eventually making them uninhabitable. And now huge swathes of southern Europe, home to millions of people for thousands of years, are under severe and immediate threat.” + Solar power generation in Texas is up 40 percent over last year. + According to a piece in Forbes, it seems like Trump’s campaign to halt the transition to renewable energy sources are failing: In the third quarter, USA spending on clean energy and transportation jumped 8% from a year ago to $75 billion, the highest quarterly amount ever. And so far this year, such investments are running 6% ahead of the first three quarters of 2024. December + The mass coral bleaching event that began in 2023 has become the largest event ever recorded. It is the fourth mass coral bleaching event ever recorded and the second to occur in the last 10 years. Since January, 2023, at least 83.7% of the world’s coral reef areas have been damaged by bleaching-level heat stress, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced last week. + According to a new paper published in Nature Communications, peak glacier extinction will occur in the next 15 to 30 years: “Here, using three global glacier models, we project a sharp rise in the number of glaciers disappearing worldwide, peaking between 2041 and 2055 with up to ~4,000 glaciers vanishing annually.” + The massive flooding in Sumatra may have been a death knell for the world’s endangered great ape, the Tapanuli orangutan. Primatologists are calling the flooding an “extinction-level disturbance” for the species, which has fewer than 800 individuals left. Large areas of habitat have been destroyed and ape conservation groups estimate that as much as 11% (35 or more individuals) of the orangutan’s entire population may have been lost. + The Trump administration is pulling the plug on one of the world’s leading climate research stations, the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Known as the “Global Mothership” for climate and weather forecasting, Ross Vought, Trump’s hatchet man at OMB, says the Center needs to be eliminated because its research and forecasts spread “climate alarmism.” This is the climate equivalent of Trump trying to tell people that their food and energy prices have gone down, not up. + In New York City, congestion pricing has led to a 22 percent decline in particulate pollution, a study finds. + More than 1,800 people died and some 1.2 million were chased from their when two overlapping tropical cyclones – Ditwah and Senyar – hit Sumatra region of Indonesia and Peninsular Malaysia at the same time, generating deadly floods, mudflows and landslides. The storms developed over North Indian Ocean waters that were 0.2°C warmer than the historical 1991-2020 average. It is one of the most lethal weather-related disasters in recent history and recent research by the World Weather Attribution group corroborates the theory that climate change is making these deadly cyclones more frequent, the winds stronger and the rainfall more intense. + According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said this year is “virtually certain” to finish as either the second- or third-warmest year since records began around 1850: The global average temperature anomaly for January to November 2025 stands at 0.60°C above the 1991–2020 average, or 1.48°C above the 1850–1900 pre-industrial reference. These anomalies are identical to those recorded for the full year 2023, currently the second warmest year. + The last 10 years have been the 10 hottest years on record.

Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026.

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Title: January 1, 2026

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important. Consider joining The Conversation, a site that has actual researchers write clear articles about important topics (“Deepfakes leveled up in 2025. Here’s what’s coming next.”) Be like Jimmy the President. Be like Leo the Pope. Be like the Drunken Raccoon. Make a difference where you are. (Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us. To the good folks we’ve met along the way, and with whom we chat too rarely. To Andrew and Michelle Foster of Seafarer Capital Partners for their vision of a better kind of fund company, and their enduring success. To Mark and Tina Oelschlager, the folks behind the small and excellent Towpath Focus Fund, for thoughtful talks and cheerful humanity … and enduring success.

To Dave Sherman, founder of Cohanzick / CrossingBridge, whose formidable intellect and Tigger-like energy has translated into a bunch of funds that consistently honor the credo, “return of investment is more important than return on investment.” To the inestimably talented Charles, maestro of MFO Premium, whose tools deserve about ten times the attention – and financial support – that they receive. To Chuck Jaffe, aka “Hurricane Chuck,” who’s still at it after all these years, and to Dan Wiener, who our colleague Ed Studzinski denominated as Dan Dan the Vanguard Man, who has had the sense to take a step back and enjoy life. To our colleague Lynn Bolin, who has done likewise and yet writes better than ever, and to The Shadow, who might yet find cause to slow down. To Victoria Odinotska of Kanter Public Relations, a bright spirit and humane voice who toils bravely while under the burden of the ongoing assault on her beloved homeland. To the good folks at Long/Short Advisors and Cook & Bynum for keeping in touch, thoughtfully and consistently, over the years. Finally, to our faithful subscribers and readers, thanks!

Title: BlackRock dumps, Saylor buys: Holiday chaos erupts as crypto market ends 2025

Together, they show two very different institutional approaches to Bitcoin exposure. While many regular investors were relaxing during the holidays, the world’s biggest asset manager was making major moves. BlackRock quietly transferred $214 million worth of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] to Coinbase Prime in a series of year-end transactions, as reported by Arkham. These transfers come at a key moment for the company’s crypto ETFs, as both IBIT and ETHA are seeing falling investor interest. The on-chain activity suggests BlackRock is no longer just holding crypto; it’s actively managing liquidity to handle a wave of investor redemptions. The $214 million shift appears to be a direct response to cooling demand for U.S. crypto ETFs. Since 18th December, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has faced steady outflows, with $7.9 million leaving the fund on the 29th of December alone. That same day, all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs together saw $19.3 million in withdrawals. Ethereum ETFs are facing similar pressure, with BlackRock’s ETHA losing $13.3 million on the 29th of December, nearly doubling the entire day’s net outflow for Ethereum ETFs. This pattern shows that many institutional investors are pulling back, likely because of year-end tax-loss harvesting and profit-taking after a volatile final quarter. While ETF investors are stepping back, Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is doing the opposite. On the same day, BlackRock saw redemptions, Strategy bought another 1,229 BTC for $108.85 million as per Lookonchain data. The company paid an average of $88,568 per Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to an incredible 672,497 BTC. Despite recent market swings, Strategy is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $8.31 billion, a 16% gain overall. This creates an interesting contrast in the crypto market, wherein BlackRock is acting as a liquidity provider, moving BTC and ETH onto exchanges to help ETF investors cash out. Meanwhile, Strategy is acting as a liquidity sink, buying Bitcoin and holding it long-term, taking supply out of the market. Yet, despite all this movement, prices have barely reacted. Bitcoin at press time was changing hands at $87,900, up only 0.24% in 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum was trading at $2,974, with a small 0.45% gain. This price-flow divergence, with big movements of money without big moves in price, shows that the market likely expected these end-of-year withdrawals. Therefore, as we move into January, attention will shift from these withdrawals to the new year’s sentiment. Now, whether Saylor can pull retail investors back into the market is still unclear, but one thing is obvious from the on-chain data: the weak hands are exiting, and the biggest players are simply repositioning for 2026.

Title: Software taketh away faster than hardware giveth: Why C++ programmers keep growing fast despite competition, safety, and AI

Sutter’s Mill Herb Sutter on software development 2025 was another great year for C++. It shows in the numbers Before we dive into the data below, let’s put the most important question up front: Why have C++ and Rust been the fastest-growing major programming languages from 2022 to 2025? Primarily, it’s because throughout the history of computing “software taketh away faster than hardware giveth.” There is enduring demand for efficient languages because our demand for solving ever-larger computing problems consistently outstrips our ability to build greater computing capacity, with no end in sight. [6] Every few years, people wonder whether our hardware is just too fast to be useful, until the future’s next big software demand breaks across the industry in a huge wake-up moment of the kind that iOS delivered in 2007 and ChatGPT delivered in November 2022. AI is only the latest source of demand to squeeze the most performance out of available hardware. Quick quiz: What are the two biggest constraints on computing growth in 2025? What’s in shortest supply? Take a moment to answer that yourself before reading on… — — — If you answered exactly “power and chips,” you’re right — and in the right order. Chips are only our #2 bottleneck. It’s well known that the hyperscalars are competing hard to get access to chips. That’s why NVIDIA is now the world’s most valuable company, and TSMC is such a behemoth that it’s our entire world’s greatest single point of failure. But many people don’t realize: Power is the #1 constraint in 2025. Did you notice that all the recent OpenAI deals were expressed in terms of gigawatts? Let’s consider what three C-level executives said on their most recent earnings calls. [1] Amy Hood, Microsoft CFO (MSFT earnings call, October 29, 2025): [Microsoft Azure’s constraint is] not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power, is the language we use, to put them in. Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO (AMZN earnings call, October 30, 2025): [AWS added] more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we’re now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we’re on track to double again by 2027. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO (NVDA earnings call, November 19, 2025): The most important thing is, in the end, you still only have 1 gigawatt of power. One gigawatt data centers, 1 gigawatt power. … That 1 gigawatt translates directly. Your performance per watt translates directly, absolutely directly, to your revenues. That’s why the future is enduringly bright for languages that are efficient in “performance per watt” and “performance per transistor.” The size of computing problems we want to solve has routinely outstripped our computing supply for the past 80 years; I know of no reason why that would change in the next 80 years. [2] The list of major portable languages that target those key durable metrics is very short: C, C++, and Rust. [3] And so it’s no surprise to see that in 2025 all three continued experiencing healthy growth, but especially C++ and Rust. Let’s take a look. Programming is a hot market, and programmers are in long-term high-growth demand. (AI is not changing this, and will not change it; see Appendix.) “Global developer population trends 2025” (SlashData, 2025) reports that in the past three years the global developer population grew about 50%, from just over 31 million to just over 47 million. (Other sources are consistent with that: IDC forecasts that this growth will continue, to over 57 million developers by 2028. JetBrains reports similar numbers of professional developers; their numbers are smaller because they exclude students and hobbyists.) And which two languages are growing the fastest (highest percentage growth from 2022 to 2025)? Rust, and C++. To put C++’s growth in context: C++ is a living language whose core job to be done is to make the most of hardware, and it is continually evolving to stay relevant to the changing hardware landscape. The new C++26 standard contains additional support for hardware parallelism on the latest CPUs and GPUs, notably adding more support for SIMD types for intra-CPU vector parallelism, and the std::execution Sender/Receiver model for general multi-CPU and GPU concurrency and parallelism. But wait — how could this growth be happening? Isn’t C++ “too unsafe to use,” according to a spate of popular press releases and tweets by a small number of loud voices over the past few years? Let’s tackle that next… C++’s rate of security vulnerabilities has been far overblown in the press primarily because some reports are counting only programming language vulnerabilities when those are a smaller minority every year, and because statistics conflate C and C++. Let’s consider those two things separately. First, the industry’s security problem is mostly not about programming language insecurity. Year after year, and again in 2025, in the MITRE “CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses” (mitre.org, 2025) only three of the top 10 “most dangerous software weaknesses” are related to language safety properties. Of those three, two (out-of-bounds write and out-of-bounds read) are directly and dramatically improved in C++26’s hardened C++ standard library which does bounds-checking for the most widely used bounded operations (see below). And that list is only about software weaknesses, when more and more exploits bypass software entirely. Why are vulnerabilities increasingly not about language issues, or even about software at all? Because we have been hardening our software; this is why the cost of zero-day exploits has kept rising, from thousands to millions of dollars. So attackers stop pursuing that as much, and switch to target the next slowest animal in the herd. For example, “CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report” (CrowdStrike, 2025) reports that “79% of [cybersecurity intrusion] detections were malware-free,” not involving programming language exploits. Instead, there was huge growth not only in non-language exploits, but even in non-software exploits, including a “442% growth in vishing [voice phishing via phone calls and voice messages] operations between the first and second half of 2024.” Why go to the trouble of writing an exploit for a use-after-free bug to infect someone’s computer with malware which is getting more expensive every year, when it’s easier to do some cross-site scripting that doesn’t depend on a programming language, and it’s easier still to ignore the software entirely and just convince the user to tell you their password on the phone? Second, for the subset that is about programming language insecurity, the problem child is C, not C++. A serious problem is that vulnerability statistics almost always conflate C and C++; it’s very hard to find good public sources that distinguish them. The only reputable public study I know of that distinguished between C and C++ is Mend.io’s as reported in “What are the most secure programming languages?” (Mend.io, 2019). Although the data is from 2019, as you can see the results are consistent across years. Can’t see the C++ bar? Pinch to zoom. 😉 Although C++’s memory safety has always been much closer to that of other modern popular languages than to that of C, we do have room for improvement and we’re doing even better in the newest C++ standard about to be released, C++26. It delivers two major security improvements, where you can just recompile your code as C++26 and it’s significantly more secure: Additionally, C++26 adds functional safety via contracts: preconditions, postconditions, and contract assertions in the language, that programmers can use to check that their programs behave as intended well beyond just memory safety. Beyond C++26, in the next couple of years I expect to see proposals to: I know of people who’ve been asking for C++ evolution to slow down a little to let compilers and users catch up, something like we did for C++03. But we like all this extra security, too. So, just spitballing here, but hypothetically: What if we focused C++29, the next release cycle of C++, to only issue-list-level items (bug fixes and polish, not new features) and the above “hardening” list (add more library hardening, remove more language undefined behavior)? I’m intrigued by this idea, not because security is C++’s #1 burning issue — it isn’t, C++ usage is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds — but because it could address both the “let’s pause to stabilize” and “let’s harden up even more” motivations. Focus is about saying no. Programming is growing fast. C++ is growing very fast, with a healthy long-term future because it’s deeply aligned with the overarching 80-year trend that computing demand always outstrips supply. C++ is a living language that continually adapts to its environment to fulfill its core mission, tracking what developers need to make the most of hardware. And it shows in the numbers. Here’s to C++’s great 2025, and its rosy outlook in 2026! I hope you have an enjoyable rest of the holiday period, and see you again in 2026. Thanks to Saeed Amrollahi Boyouki, Mark Hoemmen and Bjarne Stroustrup for motivating me to write this post and/or providing feedback. Finally, let’s talk about the topic no article can avoid: AI. C++ is foundational to current AI. If you’re running AI, you’re running CUDA (or TensorFlow or similar) — directly or indirectly — and if you’re running CUDA (or TensorFlow or similar), you’re probably running C++. CUDA is primarily available as a C++ extension. There’s always room for DSLs at the leading edge, but for general-purpose AI most high-performance deployment and inference is implemented in C++, even if people are writing higher-level code in other languages (e.g., Python). But more broadly than just C++: What about AI generally? Will it take all our jobs? (Spoiler: No.) AI is a wonderful and transformational tool that greatly reduces rote work, including problems that have already been solved, where the LLM is trained on the known solutions. But AI cannot understand, and therefore can’t solve, new problems — which is most of the current and long-term growth in our industry. What does that imply? Two main things, in my opinion… First, I think that people who think AI isn’t a major game-changer are fooling themselves. To me, AI is on par with the wheel (back in the mists of time), the calculator (back in the 1970s), and the Internet (back in the 1990s). [5] Each of those has been a game-changing tool to accelerate (not replace) human work, and each led to more (not less) human production and productivity. I strongly recommend checking out Adam Unikowsky’s “Automating Oral Argument” (Substack, July 7, 2025). Unikowsky took his own actual oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court and showed how well 2025-era Claude can do as a Supreme Court-level lawyer, and with what strengths and weaknesses. Search for “Here is the AI oral argument” and click on the audio player, which is a recording of an actual Supreme Court session and replaces only Unikowsky’s responses with his AI-generated voice saying the AI-generated text argument directly responding to each of the justices’ actual questions; the other voices are the real Supreme Court justices. (Spoiler: “Objectively, this is an outstanding oral argument.”) Second, I think that people who think AI is going to put a large fraction of programmers out of work are fooling themselves. We’ve just seen that, today, three years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the number of human programmers is growing as fast as ever. Even the companies that are the biggest boosters of the “AI will replace programmers” meme are actually aggressively growing, not reducing, their human programmer workforces. Consider what three more C-level executives are saying. Sam Schillace, Microsoft Deputy CTO (Substack, December 19, 2025) is pretty AI-ebullient, but I do agree with this part he says well, and which resonates directly with Unikowsky’s experience above: If your job is fundamentally “follow complex instructions and push buttons,” AI will come for it eventually. But that’s not most programmers. Matt Garman, Amazon Web Services CEO (interview with Matthew Berman, X, August 2025) says bluntly: People were telling me [that] with AI we can replace all of our junior people in our company. I was like that’s … one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard. … I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job. But it doesn’t mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them. Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian CEO (Stratechery interview, December 2025) says it well: I think [AI]’s a huge force multiplier personally for human creativity, problem solving … If software costs half as much to write, I can either do it with half as many people, but [due to] core competitive forces … I will [actually] need the same number of people, I would just need to do a better job of making higher quality technology. … People shouldn’t be afraid of AI taking their job … they should be afraid of someone who’s really good at AI [and therefore more efficient] taking their job. So if we extend the question of “what are our top constraints on software?” to include not only hardware and power, the #3 long-term constraint is clear: We are chronically short of skilled human programmers. Humans are not being replaced en masse, not most of us; we are being made more productive, and we’re needed more than ever. As I wrote above: “Programming is a hot market, and programmers are in long-term high-growth demand.” [1] It’s actually great news that Big Tech is spending heavily on power, because the gigawatt capacity we build today is a long-term asset that will keep working for 15 to 20+ years, whether the companies that initially build that capacity survive or get absorbed. That’s important because it means all the power generation being built out today to satisfy demand in the current “AI bubble” will continue to be around when the next major demand for compute after AI comes along. See Ben Thompson’s great writing, such as “The Benefits of Bubbles” (Stratechery, November 2025). [2] The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy contains two opposite ideas, both fun but improbable: (1) The problem of being “too compute-constrained”: Deep Thought, the size of a city, wouldn’t really be allowed to run for 7.5 million years; you’d build a million cities. (2) The problem of having “too much excess compute capacity”: By the time a Marvin with a “brain the size of a planet” was built, he wouldn’t really be bored; we’d already be trying to solve problems the size of the solar system. [3] This is about “general-purpose” coding. Code at the leading specialized edges will always include use of custom DSLs. [4] This means that compiling plain C code (that is in the C/C++ intersection) as C++26 also automatically makes it more correct and more secure. This isn’t new; compiling C code as C++ and having the C code be more correct has been true since the 1980s. [5] If you’re my age, you remember when your teacher fretted that letting you use a calculator would harm your education. More of you remember similar angsting about letting students google the internet. Now we see the same fears with AI — as if we could stop it or any of those others even if we should. And we shouldn’t; each time, we re-learn the lesson that teaching students to use such tools should be part of their education because using tools makes us more productive. [6] This is not the same as Wirth’s Law, that “software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.” Wirth’s observation was that the overheads of operating systems and higher-level runtimes and other costly abstractions were becoming ever heavier over time, so that a program to solve the same problem was getting more and more inefficient and soaking up more hardware capacity than it used to; for example, printing “Hello world” really does take far more power and hardware when written in modern Java than it did in Commodore 64 BASIC. That doesn’t apply to C++ which is not getting slower over time; C++ continues to be at least as efficient as low-level C for most uses. No, the key point I’m making here is very different: that the problems the software is tackling are growing faster than hardware is becoming faster.

Title: Is the US economy strong heading into 2026? The picture is complicated

The world’s largest economy is growing faster than its peers, but the divide between wealthy and poorer Americans is growing. Share Save As the United States economy heads into 2026, the report card emerging on its performance is complicated. By many measures, the world’s largest economy appears to be in a strong position. After a tumultuous year marked by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his swing towards tariffs and protectionism, recent growth has outpaced the expectations of most analysts. In a speech this month, Trump hailed his economic record, insisting that the US was on the cusp of an economic boom the “likes of which the world has never seen”. Yet nestled within the economic data are signs of weakness that hint at risks down the track. And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition. Here are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close: After a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent. That was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries. During the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis. Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period. While robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. By some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025. That means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy. While many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped. Campbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity. “We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera. “This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.” While the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high. Yet Americans are continuing to spend. Consumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024. The splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year. The reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means. The top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics. Harvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10. “Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said. Rolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure. “The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera. After wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note. The benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent. While most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households. Stock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup. Despite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. Year-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September. While inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch. In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable. Some economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs. Langhammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year. “Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office. However, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact. “The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said. “Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.” Despite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January. The official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January. While Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people. Whereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Title: ROOKE: The Somali Fraud Scandal Gave Trump A Kill Switch. What Happens If He Doesn’t Use It

Americans are demanding action. Anything less will lead to political chaos. “Long Live The King,” The New York Times wrote in February when President Donald Trump posted a picture of himself as Napoleon Bonaparte alongside a quote attributed to the French emperor, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” It was this level of boldness to do the right thing for our country, no matter the costs, that led millions of Americans to vote for Trump’s second term. The Trump administration started strong. Americans wanted deportations, a rollback on every left-wing ideological policy implemented during the Biden years, and an all-out assault on government fraud and bloat that had become all too common in D.C. He took immediate action on the most critical issues voters mandated in the 2024 election. For a brief moment, it felt like the power we had given Trump and Republicans was paying off in Americans’ favor. Some even dared to say that we had finally gotten our country back. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) But something happened over the summer. As left-wing judges blocked the Trump administration at every turn, refusing to let deportations continue, and Republicans in Congress failed to codify most of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts that were made, the momentum had shifted back to the bureaucratic blob. This is not to say that the Trump administration has stopped working on these issues, but the rapid-fire successes Americans saw in the first 100 days seemed to have come to an abrupt halt. Congressional Republicans resumed their backdoor dealing, ensuring that important voter wishes were dropped from legislation before it even reached the floor. Americans couldn’t afford to take their eye off of Congress even for a moment lest their elected representatives would secretly be selling their birthright off to BlackRock and Vanguard behind their backs. We don’t need to sell federal land and turn our wilderness into housing developments. If we need more housing, let’s round up all the illegals who don’t belong in this country and evict them. That’ll free up millions of housing units in one fell swoop. Leave the federal land… — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 20, 2025 Then Trump came out and called the face of government corruption – The Epstein List – a hoax. We saw that Democrats were trying to weaponize the human trafficker to own Trump. Still, there was an understanding that Trump would save this country no matter the cost. But Americans were told not to look at it. Attorney General Pam Bondi paraded influencers out with binders of useless pages that did nothing to bring any of the bad actors to justice. Still, we were told to trust the plan. The economic strains on Americans persisted as the summer months passed. Trump flew all around the world settling foreign wars for countries that wouldn’t hesitate to ignore our calls should something kick off here at home. While some of these trips were crucial to ensuring our national economic security, the optics of them, while Americans suffered back home, were less than helpful to his mission. And unless you were clued into the political world, it’s unlikely you saw these trips as anything but an administration focused more abroad than on its citizens. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s polling trended downwards. Americans wanted more relief, action, signs of life. Regardless of what it was, they expected to see more from this administration, which had promised an end to D.C. corruption. Instead, they got a government shutdown, brought on by the same slimy officials who have never hidden their contempt for their constituents. If there was ever a black pill forced down the throats of voters, watching this circus play out live was the ultimate one. Gallup poll | 11/3-11/25 President Trump approval Disapprove 60% (+6) Approve 36% (-5)https://t.co/RFvzrLjT6Z https://t.co/treMZzeKK9 pic.twitter.com/PsH6z5Im0p — Politics & Poll Tracker 📡 (@PollTracker2024) November 28, 2025 When the November elections came and Republican voters who had turned out in droves just one year before sat home, the GOP should have had a wake-up call. Instead, they complained about low-propensity voters and harped about New York City being a hotbed for socialism. However, the writing on the wall is clear: if Republicans don’t act now, there is nothing that will stop a midterm bloodbath, which will return their power to Democrats. However, hope has come in the most unlikely of places. Like Gandalf arriving at Helm’s Deep at first light on the fifth day, emerging from the east with Erkenbrand, rescuing the Rohirrim soldiers and turning the tide of the battle against Saruman’s forces, Somalis in Minnesota were caught defrauding billions in federal funds. Trump has been given the chance to turn back the last eleven months. The anger that even everyday Americans not clued into the political system feel toward the massive fraud uncovered in Minnesota provides almost unlimited leeway to get back to work. But real action has to be taken. MINNESOTA FRAUD: @NickShirleyyy’s work has helped show Americans the scale of fraud in Tim Walz’s Minnesota. @TheJusticeDept has been investigating this for months. So far, we have charged 98 individuals – 85 of Somali descent – and more than 60 have been found guilty in… — Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) December 29, 2025 It’s not enough for Bondi and other agencies and officials to post their supposed arrest and conviction stats as proof they are working when more and more fraud is being uncovered, not by them but by citizen journalists. Nothing less than massive arrests and deportations in every state will satisfy Americans looking for action. The focus shouldn’t just be on Somalis or other immigrant groups gaming the corrupt system. Elected officials and their bureaucratic allies need to be taken down with them. Trump needs to use the bully pulpit voters have given him. If Republicans are standing in the way of enacting the will of the people, call them out. Let the voters help take the obstinate D.C. swamp rats out with the trash. Americans want their country back. Kill the fraud. If the Trump administration and GOP Congressmen do not produce adequate results, why would voters ever give them power again? The Democrats will come in and ruin Trump’s legacy. Whatever work he has completed will be torn down, as if this past year never even happened.

Please let us know Topic:Financial Markets The value of Australian gold mining stocks skyrocketed in 2025. (Unsplash: Zlataky Cz) Interest rate cuts drove the Australian share market to its highest level ever in October 2025. Expectations of rate hikes in 2026 are driving the Australian dollar higher, though the ASX has fallen from its record. Market analysts expect shares of gold and AI stocks to continue doing well next year, though global markets may encounter more volatility from US President Donald Trump's unpredictable governing style. With 2025 almost over, now is perhaps as good a time as any to look back at where we could have invested our hard-earned money — but probably did not. Those who had the foresight (or luck) to buy mining stocks at the start of the year would have seen the value of those investments double, or even triple. Take, for example, Liontown Resources — a battery minerals company that reported a $193 million loss in the previous financial year. Despite its lacklustre financial performance, Liontown counts mining billionaire Gina Rinehart as its largest shareholder (with an almost 20 per cent stake through her company Hancock Prospecting). Gold miners dominate the list of best performing stocks in 2025. (Bloomberg, ABC News) The company has also inked lithium supply deals with Tesla, Ford and LG. And it received a $50 million investment from the federal government in August as part of its Future Made in Australia strategy to prop up certain industries in the national interest. It is no wonder the share price of this unprofitable, partly taxpayer-funded lithium miner has surged 180 per cent since January, making it one of the best performers on the Australian share market. Shares of its rivals Core Lithium (up 220 per cent), PLS (up 89 per cent) and IGO (up 65 per cent) have also enjoyed strong gains. The rally was also driven by a rebound in lithium prices (since crashing in 2023 on concerns about an oversupply of the battery mineral) and expectations of strong demand for electric vehicles in the years ahead, particularly in China. Another surprise was the sheer number of gold miners in the list of this year's best-performing stocks. They included Regis Resources, Genesis Minerals, Evolution Mining and Newmont Corporation. Shares of mining companies surged in 2025. (Bloomberg, ABC News) The value of their shares has roughly tripled in the past year as the price of physical gold has hit new record highs throughout the year, even climbing as high as $US4,532 an ounce last week. "What's driving the price higher in the last two years is mainly central banks buying gold as they move away from the US dollar and US dollar assets like Treasury bonds," said Gemma Dale, nabTrade's head of investor behaviour. Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset that tends to do well in times of global uncertainty. Financial commentators often cite US President Donald Trump's erratic policymaking and ever-changing tariff policies as reasons for gold's relatively recent popularity. Another concern is whether the Federal Reserve will continue to make interest rate decisions independently, free from the White House's interference, particularly given the US president's recent efforts to appoint rate-cutting loyalists. Gemma Dale expects President Trump to have less influence on the markets in 2026. (ABC News: John Gunn) On top of that, the Fed has already slashed America's interest rates three times in 2025 and is likely to keep cutting them next year, which has contributed to the US dollar losing 10 per cent of its value this year. So all this, along with concerns about US economic exceptionalism and geopolitical conflict, has led to huge demand for bullion, which in turn has led to the share prices of many Australian gold mining companies rising to their most expensive levels ever. Overall, the local share market has done reasonably well, with the ASX 200 up 10 per cent (when dividends are included), and the broader All Ordinaries index gaining 7 per cent. But for those who bought into the Australian market in early April, after Mr Trump caused a global crash with his so-called liberation day tariff, and sold at a record high in late October, their gains would be much higher at about 24 per cent. When asked to describe 2025, the words "volatility" and "stress" were what came to mind for Ten Cap's lead portfolio manager and stock picker, Jun Bei Liu. Jun Bei Liu expects 2026 to be a volatile year for markets. (ABC News: John Gunn) She said: "No-one expected Trump to be negotiating tariffs so openly, which has been the cause of all this volatility on the markets" — as evidenced by the extreme swings in share prices (up and down) that have regularly occurred throughout the year. Ms Dale also found 2025 to be quite a stressful year for share investing. "We had so much concern about what the implications of those particular tariff announcements were going to be, and whether there'd potentially be a catastrophic collapse in global trade, something like we saw during COVID," Ms Dale said. Donald Trump with his 'reciprocal tariffs' chart on April 3, 2025. (Reuters: Carlos Barria) "As those fears failed to materialise … everyone jumped on the TACO trade." TACO is an acronym that stands for "Trump always chickens out", and is used by traders to describe the US president's tendency to make grand tariff threats that cause investor panic — only for him to then backflip to some degree, giving time for markets to rebound. The TACO trade — which is essentially the belief that markets will recover after Mr Trump's initial shocking announcements — has helped push many countries' share markets to their highest levels ever. However, the ASX appears to have underperformed against its overseas peers, particularly Wall Street's S&P 500 (up 18 per cent), Japan's Nikkei (up 28 per cent) and South Korea's KOSPI (up by a whopping 76 per cent). The price of gold has hit another record and is set to become Australia's second most valuable resource export after iron ore. Unlike those nations, Australia's technology sector is much smaller, making up only 3 per cent of the local share market's value. So the ASX has not benefited as much from the artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom, which has led to the share price of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla ("the Magnificent Seven"), as well as the broader US stock market, soaring to new heights. Another difference is that those foreign stock markets belong to countries that have seen significant falls in their exchange rates because they are likely to be recipients of further stimulus in 2026 (whether it is interest rate cuts or massive government spending). In contrast, Australia is more likely to see interest rates rise next year due to the return of higher inflation, which is expected to stick around for longer than what the RBA is comfortable with. The Australian market had much smaller gains than its overseas peers. (Refinitiv, ABC News) As a general rule, lower interest rates (and cheaper borrowing costs) usually lead to stock markets rising as investors pile into riskier, speculative investments — and feel more comfortable overpaying for stocks. Rate hikes, on the other hand, tend to have the opposite effect (that is, investors "selling down" and taking profits as the cost of money becomes more expensive). Concerns about the share market (or certain companies and sectors) being overvalued have grown louder over the past year. Commonwealth Bank, for instance, has developed a reputation for being the most expensive bank in the world, especially when judged by its price-to-earnings ratio (basically, the amount of money people are willing to pay for each dollar of profit it earns). After hitting a record high of $191.40 in June, CBA's share price has undergone a major correction, having dropped 16 per cent in six months. The ASX 200 crashed in April, then scaled a new record high within months. (Refinitiv) Worries about the market being too expensive have also led to the collective value of the ASX's technology and healthcare stocks falling by more than 20 per cent this year. Indeed, tech and health care are the worst-performing sectors on the local share market — largely due to steep falls in the share price of biotech giant CSL (-39 per cent), bookkeeping software firm Xero (-33 per cent) and logistics software company WiseTech Global (-45 per cent). WiseTech, meanwhile, has also taken a hit from personal scandals involving its founder Richard White, which led to him being forced to step down as CEO — though he has since taken up the executive chairman role. The tech and healthcare sectors had the steepest falls in 2025. (Refinitiv, ABC News) She does, however, expect companies like NextDC and Goodman Group, both AI data centre owners, to earn strong profits next year, which will support their share price. Ms Liu expects "resources [stocks] should continue to do well, led by copper and gold prices". "Airlines should do better because oil prices are reasonably low and some of the 'oversold' tech companies could make a comeback," Ms Liu said. This year saw economies survive tariff shocks and markets burst through record highs, but it doesn't feel like a party because so many people aren't invited. "I think the share market will do OK next year and should deliver a return between 8 and 10 per cent. That's pretty much an average year." "We expect there'll still be volatility because we still haven't got the final outcome for the China and US tariffs. All we've got from both sides is just a framework." Although Mr Trump's unpredictability had a significant impact on markets this year, Ms Dale believes he will have far less influence in 2026. "The markets don't believe him anymore," she said. "They believe that everything he does is a negotiating tactic, so it's no longer credible. So he can make these big dramatic announcements and they won't be market-moving anymore." "And I think that's a really interesting outcome because people trust that he will back down. Trump has flooded the airwaves to the point where the market is just a little bit more relaxed. "At this point, 2026 looks like it could be a solid, boring kind of year with the major sectors holding up OK, but not sensational levels of growth."

Title: XRP ETFs Pull In $1.3B in 50 Days—What the Data Suggests if Flows Reach $5B

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © CL STOCK / Shutterstock.com In just 50 days since launch, XRP ETFs pulled in $1.3 billion with 43 consecutive trading days of positive inflows—the first and only zero-inflow day occurred on December 26, 2025. That pace ranks XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) among the fastest institutional adoption curves outside Bitcoin. Institutional capital entered steadily even while XRP’s price fell 50% from its July 2025 peak of $3.56, and the broader crypto markets struggled through December’s volatility. With inflows averaging $27.7 million daily and 746 million XRP now locked in ETF custody, the question becomes structural: What happens to supply, liquidity, and market depth if XRP ETF flows reach $5 billion? FAMILY STOCK / Shutterstock.com In 50 days, XRP ETFs absorbed $1.3 billion while locking 746 million XRP—roughly 1.14% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply—with virtually zero redemptions through late December. The pace shows how quickly institutional capital can tighten supply before prices respond. Here’s how issuers performed. Canary Capital defined the market early. XRPC launched on November 13 and pulled in $250 million on day one. The fund now holds approximately $384 million, roughly 30% of total XRP ETF assets. That share stayed stable despite cheaper competitors entering the market, showing institutions favored liquidity and early access over low fees. Daily inflows often exceeded $100 million outside headline events, signaling durable allocation rather than event-driven trading. Canary’s book reflects committed institutional demand building positions over weeks. Grayscale’s strength came from existing relationships. Assets from its XRP Trust rolled directly into GXRP at launch, creating instant scale without requiring new capital commitments. The fund now manages more than $220 million, and that capital has proven sticky—investors didn’t rotate out after launch-week excitement faded. The conversion structure reduced friction for allocators who wanted regulated exposure without operational changes to custody arrangements. GXRP’s steady flows demonstrate how institutional familiarity still matters in ETF adoption, even when competitors offer lower fees. Franklin took a different approach. XRPZ launched with a 0.19% expense ratio—the lowest in the category—and raised over $190 million. Adoption has been measured rather than explosive, which fits its target audience. As annual portfolio reviews roll through advisory practices in Q1 2026, Franklin’s market share may rise as cost-conscious allocators shift from higher-fee competitors. These quieter flows still contribute meaningfully to tightening available XRP supply, even if they don’t generate daily headline volume. Bitwise attracts active trading desks that rebalance frequently, resulting in uneven but persistent inflows as institutions adjust crypto exposure tactically. 21Shares extends reach through international distribution channels, particularly in Europe where cross-border ETF access matters for multi-jurisdiction allocators. Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com At the current pace, XRP ETF inflows show steady institutional commitment rather than speculative bursts. With roughly $27.7 million entering daily on average over 50 days, assets continue climbing on a predictable trajectory driven by consistent allocation rather than momentum trading. Maintaining this velocity places the $5 billion milestone approximately 130 days away from current levels, pointing to mid-May 2026. Hitting that threshold would lock an estimated 2.6 billion XRP into ETF custody—representing roughly 4% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply. That’s a fourfold increase from current 1.14% lockup levels. That accumulation compounds existing supply removal happening outside ETFs. Exchange balances fell dramatically throughout 2025, dropping from approximately 4 billion XRP at year-start to just 1.6-1.7 billion by late December—a 58% decline. While ETFs absorbed 746 million of that withdrawal, the remaining 1.5+ billion XRP moved into private custody wallets, institutional cold storage, and long-term holder addresses, showing accumulation extending well beyond regulated products. XRP’s supply is fixed at 65.5 billion in circulation, so tokens placed in regulated custody don’t return to active trading unless investors redeem ETF shares. If institutional positions remain in place for quarters rather than weeks, liquidity tightens through structure rather than sentiment, fundamentally reshaping market depth and available float over time regardless of short-term price moves. TopMicrobialStock / Shutterstock.com ETF inflows rarely move in straight lines. Three forces could push XRP funds past the $5 billion mark faster than the current 130-day projection. BlackRock’s absence remains the largest variable in XRP’s ETF growth trajectory. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion in assets within its first year, demonstrating BlackRock’s unmatched ability to mobilize institutional capital at scale through its Aladdin platform connections and relationships with thousands of wealth advisors. The firm tends to wait for regulatory clarity rather than chase first-mover advantage. Once confident in the legal framework, BlackRock moves decisively. A late XRP ETF filing from BlackRock would carry enormous weight with allocators—many institutions wait for BlackRock’s entry as implicit validation. Based on IBIT’s trajectory, a BlackRock XRP ETF could potentially bring $1-2 billion in launch-month inflows alone, compressing timelines dramatically. As Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin expands across blockchains and into lending markets—currently at approximately $1.3 billion market cap—XRP gains functional relevance beyond passive custody. RLUSD settlement on XRP Ledger creates organic demand for XRP as a bridge currency and fee-payment mechanism. Utility-backed flows tend to be stickier than speculative positioning. If RLUSD scales to $5-10 billion and begins facilitating significant cross-border settlement volume through ODL corridors, the narrative around XRP shifts from “crypto asset” to “payments infrastructure token.” XRP ETF inflows held remarkably steady despite Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs facing significant outflows during the same November-December period. If Bitcoin reclaims $100,000+ and sustains that level through Q1 2026, ETFs across all crypto assets often see second-wave institutional demand. A healthier macro backdrop could lift daily XRP ETF subscriptions well above the current $27.7 million average. XRP ETF inflows have fundamentally shifted the conversation from price speculation to structural market changes. Sustained allocations totaling $1.3 billion over 50 days, 746 million XRP locked away from trading circulation, and disciplined institutional behavior through volatile December conditions all point to a market changing quietly beneath range-bound price action. The path to $5 billion isn’t guaranteed—macro shocks, prolonged underperformance, or capital fragmentation could derail the current trajectory. But the path is measurable and predictable if current conditions hold. At $27.7 million daily, XRP ETFs reach $5 billion by mid-May 2026, locking 4% of circulating supply into regulated custody. From a technical standpoint, XRP consolidating between $1.85-$2.00 while ETF accumulation continues supports the supply squeeze thesis building over months. A decisive breakout above $2.20 with expanding volume would signal the structural changes are beginning to impact price discovery. If $5 billion hits with XRP trading above $2.50, the combination of reduced available float and improving sentiment could accelerate moves toward $3-4 as patient institutional positioning meets returning retail demand.

Wealth quote of the day by Bill Ackman: “Investing is one of the few businesses where you can do everything right and still lose money in the short term. What matters is a strategy that works long term—and the discipline to ignore the noise.” Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, is a name synonymous with high-stakes Wall Street drama. Ackman has spent decades perfecting a strategy known as activist investing. Unlike traditional investors who buy and sell quietly, Ackman takes massive, concentrated stakes in companies and publicly demands structural changes to unlock value.

Title: Looking Back at 2025 – I Really Have to Just Focus on the Highs Again

Once again on the path out of 2025 continues with what is sometimes my final reflective post to be written during the year. The Year is 2025 There is, at this point, a long tradition of such posts here at TAGN. If you are sufficiently bored, you can indulge yourself with the musings of past years: Usually I do highs and lows. Once in a while I try highs, lows, and in between. Those are rare years. And then there are years where the lows will grind you down if you spend too much time dwelling on them, so I just have to zero in on the good things. 2024 was like that, and 2025 even more so. For years like those I have to just leave behind all the layoffs, cancellations, studio closures, corporate greed, transparent bonus chasing, lies, betrayals, and any AI related stupidity… which is 99% of the pro-AI discourse… and focus on what went right. Or at least I have to try. I cannot be held responsible for any backhanded compliments or sarcasm you may perceive. I am only human, and can only play along with so much greed and stupidity before I start using “fuck” as a modifier in every other sentence. So here we go. CCP Enad Global 7 Other MMO and Online Game Things Other Video Game Items Blogs, Social Media, Media, and Online Life That is what springs to mind in my stream of consciousness. What else good happened? 2026 It is coming. We cannot stop it. We will have to see what it brings and what we can make from that. Thanks for reminding me I really need to watch KPop Demon Hunters. I’m always late to the zeitgeist. I only just watched the first season of Arcane and I haven’t gotten to Fallout yet. I am up to speed on Stranger Things, though. Out of curiosity, other than Snoop Dogg, what’s AI about Luna? I thought it was just the same as GeForce Now only you get it bundled with Prime. Then again, I haven’t actually used it yet… LikeLike Their intro to Luna had Snoop Dogg as the inaugural entry with a promise of more AI powered titles promised, so there was an least the implication that they are going to keep pressing the “AI” button. Then again, I am starting to see some companies and pundits lauding AI in applications where it would more correctly be called “software.” So we’re getting both people predicting a perfect AI nirvana world and others trying to jump on the bandwagon by just calling all software that does any analysis of data input “AI” as opportunistic branding. LikeLike So it goes… Thanks for keeping this going. Having another average curmudgeon to sympathize with every day keeps me grounded. Good things worth mentioning… Watching Kimmel stick it to the man (and the mouse) was, at least in the end, very enjoyable. Sinners – if you haven’t seen it, see it. LikeLike I liked Sinners. My problem was that people I know who love horror could not stop saying how great it was… and it wasn’t all that. Not for me at least. But that is always a problem, when something gets built up too much based on hype. The thing with Kimmel is that it came in the context of an awful government pressuring our billionaire overlords to stifle dissent. I applaud Kimmel, but the context of the situation is still very very bad. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: New York City Pensions Shelve Recommendation to Rebid BlackRock Mandate, Terminate Fidelity
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/new-york-city-pensions-shelve-recommendation-to-rebid-blackrock-mandate-terminate-fidelity/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T17:33:11Z

City Comptroller Brad Lander had proposed the moves, alleging the firms have failed to meet the funds’ net zero plans. The trustees of New York City’s five pension funds have shelved recommendations from outgoing New York City Comptroller Brad Lander to rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandate and to terminate agreements with Fidelity due to allegedly “inadequate” decarbonization plans. “While I am disappointed in the decision of NYCERS’ trustees to table my recommendation to rebid BlackRock’s mandate today, I hope the trustees will vote to adopt it in the new year, as Comptroller-Elect Mark Levine takes office,” Lander said in a statement issued on December 17. Lander noted that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in a 2020 letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and that the firm was shifting its investment strategy to focus on climate-related investing. “Unfortunately, BlackRock in 2025 is failing to act like it,” Lander said regarding Fink’s position. “BlackRock has chosen to backtrack on their commitments and they now refuse to conduct proxy engagement with companies where they own a significant share of the stock.” For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  Lander, whose term as comptroller will end on January 1, 2026, made his recommendation—after updating the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan—for three of the five pension funds: the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. Lander said the recommendations were based on a “rigorous evaluation.” BlackRock’s mandate is set to expire at the end of 2026. When Lander made his recommendation in November, he included agreements with PanAgora Asset Management as ones to be reconsidered. According to his latest announcement, he considers those agreements appropriate to continue, after PanAgora submitted an amended net zero plan that included additional information about its engagement with portfolio companies to encourage them to adopt net zero plans. In response to Lander’s accusations, BlackRock’s Head of the Americas Institutional Business Armando Senra published a letter to Lander accusing him of politicizing the city’s pension funds and stating that altering any of the funds’ portfolios would have to undergo a review process involving the plans’ board and the New York City Bureau of Asset Management investment team. The Bureau of Asset Management, part of the comptroller’s office, is responsible for overseeing the investment portfolios of the city’s public pension systems. According to Senra’s letter, the world’s largest asset manager has had multiple conversations with the bureau’s investment team concerning investment and decarbonization plans over the past several months and met with the funds’ investment team in November to provide an update on BlackRock’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. “During that meeting, we informed the investment team that a version of this program is now available to each of the five pension plans,” Senra wrote. Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonpartisan business advocacy group, said in a statement that Lander’s recommendation is “unilateral and incomprehensible.” “[BlackRock] is a key member of the Partnership for New York City and is well known for its global leadership on sustainability and environmental issue,” Wylde said in the statement. “It is our hope that the pragmatic interests of the city and our public pension funds will prevail over political theater under incoming Comptroller[-Elect] Mark Levine.” Fidelity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © aleks333 / Shutterstock.com Galaxy Digital is taking an unusually candid stance on Bitcoin’s (CRYPTO: BTC) next phase. According to Alex Thorn, the firm’s head of research, Galaxy sees Bitcoin’s 2026 price too chaotic to forecast confidently, even as longer-term conviction remains intact. Galaxy’s comments reflect a market shaped by macro policy swings, political risk, and shifting institutional behavior rather than the clean four-year cycle patterns that defined previous bull runs. Here’s the problem: the Federal Reserve might cut rates 2-3 times or hold steady depending on inflation. Trump administration pro-crypto policies might execute quickly or stall in Congress. Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks means macro data—jobs reports, GDP prints, inflation readings—now drives price more than crypto-specific news. That creates genuine uncertainty where Bitcoin could reasonably land anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 by mid-2026. Yet beneath that near-term chaos, Galaxy argues that structural adoption continues building. ETFs, corporate balance sheets, and pension frameworks are permanently reshaping institutional capital engagement. That divide explains why short-term forecasts look chaotic while Galaxy’s Bitcoin $250K 2027 target remains firmly on the table. RoseLife_Family / Shutterstock.com Galaxy sees three factors making Bitcoin 2026 unpredictable: Fed rate cuts colliding with stubborn inflation, policy execution risk with midterms approaching, and Bitcoin’s equity correlation tying price to macro data rather than crypto fundamentals. Macro uncertainty sits at the center of Galaxy’s 2026 forecasting problem. The Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts—the market expects 2-3 cuts bringing rates from 4.5% toward 3.5-4%—yet inflation hovering near 3% limits flexibility. The Fed’s 2% target remains out of reach, creating tension between easing policy and controlling prices. Labor data and recession odds remain fluid, keeping policy expectations unstable. Strong jobs reports could delay cuts, while weak GDP prints could accelerate them. This makes it impossible to confidently project where Bitcoin lands because its performance has become increasingly tied to broader financial conditions. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto direction has improved sentiment—Paul Atkins at the SEC, Michael Selig at the CFTC, the GENIUS Act signed in July—but execution risk remains high. Legislation like the Clarity Act could pass the Senate in Q1 2026 or stall for months in committee debates. Trade policy, fiscal spending, and election dynamics—midterms hit in November 2026—could shift liquidity faster than markets can price in. When policy timelines are uncertain and political outcomes unclear, forecasting asset prices 12 months out becomes guesswork. Bitcoin’s correlation with equities climbed sharply over 2024-2025. Bitcoin now often moves in sync with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, tying performance to broad risk appetite rather than the original “digital gold” scarcity narrative. When stocks fall on recession fears, Bitcoin typically falls harder, and when stocks rally on Fed dovishness, Bitcoin follows—a strong jobs report can send Bitcoin up 5% in a day, while a weak GDP print can drop it by 8% as investors flee to bonds and cash. Mer_Studio / Shutterstock.com Galaxy’s long-term case separates short-term noise from structural change. While 2026 remains too chaotic to forecast, durable adoption trends still support a $250,000 scenario by the end of 2027. Spot Bitcoin ETFs created a standing institutional bid that didn’t exist in prior cycles. BlackRock’s IBIT alone gathered over $71 billion, proving regulated access unlocked deep pools of capital. Even during weeks with $497 million in outflows, the infrastructure stayed open. Vanguard’s expansion of ETF access to its 50 million clients in December 2025 reinforces these are permanent channels. Corporate adoption has moved beyond experimental allocations. Strategy’s holdings of over 670,000 BTC—worth roughly $59 billion at $88,000—reshaped how public company balance sheets treat Bitcoin. More than 160 public companies now follow similar frameworks. With projected corporate holdings potentially nearing one million BTC by late 2026, supply dynamics tighten. FASB’s fair-value accounting shift in late 2024 removed a key barrier—companies can now mark Bitcoin to market value each quarter. Pension exposure remains small—most allocations are 0.5-2% of portfolio value—but direction matters more than magnitude. Wisconsin, Michigan, and UK pension allocations signal acceptance within conservative mandates. Even 1% positions matter when portfolios are measured in trillions. A 1% allocation from a $500 billion pension fund is $5 billion—more than most retail waves. These decisions take years to reverse once governance boards approve them. Galaxy frames $250,000 as conditional, not guaranteed. Bitcoin’s role alongside gold as a hedge against currency debasement—protection against deficit spending and money printing—strengthens the case. If rates trend toward 3% by 2027 and institutions keep accumulating through ETFs and treasuries, supply-demand math shifts quickly. With 19.8 million Bitcoin in circulation and potentially 2-3 million locked in long-term institutional custody (ETFs, corporate treasuries, lost coins), the available supply for sale shrinks. That asymmetry—growing demand meeting shrinking supply—creates upside potential that compounds over time. Galaxy’s framework is straightforward: 2026 is a coin flip between conflicting forces, but 2027’s direction is clearer. Whether Bitcoin reaches $130,000 or retests $70,000 in 2026 depends entirely on variables no one controls—Fed rate decisions responding to inflation data that hasn’t printed yet, Clarity Act timing in a Senate facing midterm pressures, and whether recession fears materialize or fade. But here’s what doesn’t change regardless of 2026’s path: BlackRock’s $71 billion IBIT isn’t disappearing. Strategy’s 670,000 BTC isn’t getting sold. Pension boards in Wisconsin and Michigan that approved allocations aren’t reversing decisions. These structural shifts create a floor that wasn’t there in previous cycles. That’s why Galaxy maintains $250K by 2027 despite calling 2026 too chaotic to forecast. When demand keeps growing from permanent institutional infrastructure while available supply keeps shrinking, the direction becomes clear even if the timing stays messy. Galaxy’s betting that 18 months is enough time for macro conditions to resolve while structural forces compound. The 2026 range might be wide, but the 2027 trajectory is narrowing.

Title: 3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy if You Want to Outperform Next Year

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Cherdchai101 / Shutterstock.com The past year has been a continuation of an unceasing tech rally, one that may continue well into 2026 and beyond. If you are a strong believer in that, looking into Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) can help you outperform the broader market significantly. All three are riding the AI megatrend and have strong revenue visibility beyond 2026. These companies are on the “frontline” when it comes to AI hardware. Data centers are being built out at a record pace, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not the only company that is benefiting from it. The market is starting to move past NVDA stock and is pouring into other satellite AI beneficiaries who are seeing explosive upward momentum one after the other. Let’s take a look at why the following three can win big next year. If you’ve built a PC anytime soon, you’ll know that random-access memory (RAM) prices have been soaring. Certain RAM chips have seen their prices quintuple or more in a matter of weeks. This is thanks to stubborn demand from data centers outpacing supply. One would logically say: how can I benefit from this instead of losing out like every other consumer? Micron is a medium to do just that. This company sells semiconductors like DRAM, RAM, NAND flash, SSDs, and similar items that are seeing record demand from data centers. It is seeing demand so strong that the company’s management has decided to exit the consumer market and is now focusing on enterprise clients. I believe this will increase margins significantly, as the consumer market has lower margins. Companies are willing to pay far more, especially at a time when it is becoming harder to secure supplies for data centers. Every hyperscaler is rushing to build as much as possible, and Micron is well-positioned to benefit from that. Analysts expect the RAM market to remain tight through 2026, possibly stretching into 2027 or even 2028. Thus, I see MU stock outperforming in 2026. It has delivered over 226% in year-to-date 2025 gains (as of writing). Western Digital is in a similar market, but it supplies another crucial component that data centers need. It focuses on hard drives and solid-state drives. If you use a computer, you certainly have those components being used, and data centers are putting them into use even more aggressively. AI training needs petabytes (thousands of terabytes) of data. The amount of data needed is only increasing as the AI battle heats up. It’s not just text AI that is being trained by companies now. Image AI models and video AI models need even more data, as they often train on 4K videos. The meteoric increase in demand has translated into the stock price exploding by over 288% year-to-date. You’re still paying just 23 times forward earnings for FY 2026 (ends in June 2026). I expect a lot more upside as FY 2026 EPS growth is expected at 58%. It may prove to be an underestimate if data center demand again proves to be sticky. ACM Research makes equipment for semiconductor fabrication, particularly wet cleaning systems (SAPS, Tahoe) and electroplating (ECP) tools. This is a U.S.-based company, but the twist is that it owns a much larger Chinese company called ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc. That Chinese arm is worth $12.2 billion, of which 74.6% is owned by ACM Research. This equals $9.1 billion, well over the $2.64 billion market capitalization on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This discrepancy was called out by Kerrisdale Capital in January of this year, where ACMR stock was called a “10-Bagger”. ACMR stock is up over 132% since then, and I believe it can go much higher. Financials are still excellent, and the Chinese arm maintains market dominance. The company can also skirt geopolitical tensions (as it has done recently) due to the Chinese arm being separate. Analysts expect nearly 16% revenue growth for all of 2025 and 18.3% revenue growth next year. You’re paying less than 20 times forward earnings for the stock, though that is irrelevant considering the large discrepancy between the Shanghai arm and the U.S.-traded entity makes it a bargain-basement buy.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

Title: Tech Trainwrecks: The Biggest Fails of 2025

We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions.

Title: My Top 10 Learnings from 37 Podcasts with Harry Stebbings and Rory O’Driscoll This Year

Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts Harry Stebbings. Rory ODriscoll and I have done 37 podcasts together this year (!). We didn’t miss a week. But man, the world changed in those 37 weeks. My top learnings… and what’s changed: I know this can be triggering, and I know it sounds unfair and wrong. But the rate at which the best AI + B2B startups can scale today is utterly unprecedented. It’s not just the ones you know. Higgsfield is growing at rates I’ve never seen coming up on $200m run-rate in < 12 months. It’s not just Replit and Lovable and Cursor. It’s amazing there are 20+ others you’ve never even heard of getting to $100m ARR in 12-18 months now. Vertical B2B + AI leaders like @owner accelerating at scale. You just have to find those ones. We’re just getting started. It’s not just startups. Leaders like Salesforce will be almost nothing like they were before, when most of their functions are run by agents. These “AI Agents” in B2B really didn’t work for the first half of 2025. They didn’t. They got better with Claude 3.7, better with Claude 4, and I think, even better with Claude 4.5. @Replit got truly great only with Agent v3 just a few months ago. Today? My agents talk to other agents, debate features, and run almost infinitely. And that’s just the change in the last 90 days. The rate of change here is difficult to see, but it is epic. AI Agents really will work in 2026 in B2B in a way they were mostly experiments in 2025. The difference between the leaders in B2B this year, and the ones that struggled? The ones that ended the year with stock prices up +40%, vs. -25%? They really tapped into AI Tailwinds. Not just claiming they added AI to their products. This sounds obvious today, but it wasn’t 100% clear when we started the pod. Cloud is “dead”. “SaaS” is dead. But B2B AI is attracting more budget than ever before. AI Cloud, AI SaaS, AI B2B, AI datacenter. Per Gartner, total enterprise software spending is accelerating faster than ever before. Go get that budget. I’m now “Replit Fluent.” 9 apps in production. 780,000+ uses already. 6 months ago I couldn’t finish my first project. 10 months ago this would have been impossible. Now I can will almost anything I want to build for the SaaStr community into production — the only limit is time. The learning curve in AI is real, but if you push through, it’s a superpower you never had before. 2,221 CEOs quit last year (up 24%). But — this is not the time or age of professional CEOs. Stay. Founders, stay. The rate of change in the Age of AI is just too fast. Your startup (or large company) will fail or fall far behind if founders aren’t at the helm. Not always, but almost always. Co-pilots were the great failure story of 2025. They didn’t add enough value to justify the pricing. But Gamma, ElevenLabs, Palantir, Replit, Cursor all showed there is massive budget if the ROI is huge and often, near instant. The math has changed: mega-funds like a]16z ($20B) and Founders Fund ($4.6B) can just write one big check into a winner. Why struggle for 8x over 20 years on a seed fund when you can stuff $1B into Databricks at the right price? Thrive’s strategy: “Buy the best property on every block — like Monopoly.” The numbers are almost hard to believe: Nvidia: 80% of employees are now millionaires. 50% have a net worth exceeding $25 million. Wealth creation at a scale we’ve never seen in tech history. Cursor: $29.3 billion valuation. $1B+ ARR. With roughly 300 employees. That’s $100M+ in enterprise value per employee. Scale AI: Alexandr Wang became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire at 24. Meta paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake — just to get him and a handful of top AI engineers. Wang’s net worth: $3.6 billion at age 28. This was all almost brand new in 2025, the massive price for talent. The AI wealth creation machine is producing outcomes we’ve never seen before. The transformation is staggering: AI now captures half of all global venture funding. But more importantly, half of it is all going into very late stage growth deals. And that % isn’t going up. Venture $$$ are way up, back to 2021 pace, but into more and more specific, ultra-high growth, often late stage opportunities. And the pace of valuation acceleration is breathtaking: Meanwhile, traditional B2B? Mega-rounds ($100M+) collapsed from 147 deals in 2021 to just 21 in the 12 months through mid-2025. The money didn’t disappear. It just moved — all to AI. If you’re not building AI-native, you’re competing for a rapidly shrinking pool of capital. 37 podcasts. One year. And honestly? I feel like we captured a moment in time that will define the next decade of B2B software. The rules changed. The playbooks changed. The math changed. T3D2 is dead. Co-pilots failed. Founders need to stay. Agents are real. And the wealth creation is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. 2026 is going to be even wilder. See you on the pod.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Investor Paul Barron’s hint at “big news” has reignited attention on XRP exchange-traded funds this week, sending the community into speculation over possible upcoming announcements or launches. Traders and holders reacted fast on social channels, pushing chatter and price focus higher even as specifics remain unclear. According to data shared by Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominated year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF led with $25 billion in inflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF followed at $1.11 billion. Fidelity and VanEck posted $477 million and $305 million respectively. On the Ethereum side, BlackRock’s offerings recorded about $9.12 billion. A Solana staking ETF from Bitwise pulled in $839 million. These numbers show where most large investors are putting money right now. Expect some big news this week $XRP ETFs https://t.co/3BY5XJosPx — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 29, 2025 Barron’s remark has been read by many as a hint at another XRP-related announcement. Some expect a new ETF launch; others are watching for updates from issuers already in the market. That talk has helped push attention — and inflows — to XRP products that only debuted late in the year. Based on reports from rwa.xyz, on-chain data indicates tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger rose by 2,200% in 2025. The network saw about 23x growth in the value of native real-world assets, including stablecoins, and crossed the $500 million threshold. Themes around RWA tokenization were widely discussed this year by figures such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and the XRPL appears to be drawing benefit from that interest. Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $384 million in year-to-date inflows after launching in November. Other XRP spot funds have built sizable holdings too: 21Shares holds about $250 million, Bitwise roughly $227 million, Grayscale around $244 million, and Franklin about $206 million. Based on reports, all of these XRP spot ETFs launched in November and December and now tally roughly $1.24 billion in total assets under management with cumulative inflows near $1.14 billion. For a new category, that level of money moving in over a short span is notable; some industry voices point out the total might have been higher if market mood had not cooled recently. Reports also say XRP ETFs pulled in over $1 billion through 21 days of steady inflows. WisdomTree’s XRP ETF is among the pending offerings that market watchers expect to arrive next. At the same time, talk about a BlackRock XRP ETF has circulated widely. There is currently no public filing tied to a BlackRock XRP product, and reports caution that such expectations are premature without official filings or approvals. Current flows note that XRP’s ETF debut has shifted part of investor focus from pure crypto bets to spot ETF allocations and tokenization themes. Whether Barron’s hinted “big news” becomes a concrete catalyst will depend on filings and formal product launches. For now, the mix of solid early inflows and rapid XRPL tokenization growth has put XRP squarely in the conversation among ETF-focused investors and network adopters.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. It's been a wild year for tech innovation, and last January we previewed many of its most compelling new products at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As always, we searched the halls and rooms far and wide to examine cutting-edge gadgets and prototypes from more than 4,000 companies. To wrap up the show, we brought you our definitive list of the Best Tech of CES 2025—the 21 products that delighted us the most, and seemed destined to influence the rest of the industry in the months and years to come. CES is once again just a few days away, and we're all set to fly to Las Vegas. (Indeed, our joint digital media division, CNET Group, is choosing the official CES 2026 best-in-show winners, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association.) But before we pack our bags, we asked our experts to look back at the best innovations they picked from last year's show. We wanted answers to the most critical questions: What were our choices like in the real world as actual production models? Did they measure up when we tested them, or did they disappoint? Did they even come out at all? Here's what our experts discovered. When we first saw the Asus Zenbook A14, we were impressed by its slim, lightweight design, distinctive magnesium-alloy construction and Ceraluminum design, and long-lasting battery—enough to name it the best laptop of CES 2025. When we reviewed it in May, I was still wowed by all of those details, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus was a bit underwhelming, even for a Copilot+ PC. But even with low test scores, the Zenbook A14 still earned a 4-star rating as an excellent ultraportable system. It may not have won an Editors' Choice award, but it's currently listed as both the Best Windows Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000 and the Best Budget OLED Laptop, making it a smart buy for many.—Brian Westover We first got a look at the (confusingly named) Vision X AI 2nd at Computex 2024, before seeing it again in a more developed state at CES. It's a sizable and powerful gaming desktop in its own right, but its calling card is a 13-inch touch display on the front panel. This full HD panel can be used to show system diagnostics, apps, or even as a second monitor. The "AI" and "2nd" in its name refer to the NPU-bearing Arrow Lake 200 processors inside, while top-end Nvidia GPUs power gaming and graphics workloads. The main update about how this fared in 2025? It finally went on sale as a finished product, though stock is limited and configurations cost many thousands of dollars. (MSI is currently selling one model on its website for $5,499). We didn't review it ourselves yet, but it is now available for interested enthusiasts. —Matt Buzzi The Lenovo Legion Go S is a system full of potential, but when I finally got my hands on the Windows 11-powered handheld, its gaming performance ultimately let me down. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor proved too underpowered to deliver substantial gains over its predecessor and inherited much of its predecessor's clunkiness. However, Lenovo rectified most of the system’s flaws with the release of a SteamOS variant. With Windows 11 out of the picture, games performed far better than they did on the Windows-powered Go S, and it’s our recommendation for Steam Deck users looking to upgrade their system. —Zackery Cuevas MSI’s Project Zero X was an experimental “what next?” iteration on the company’s Project Zero, an initiative for PC building that enables super-minimalist, clean-looking desktop PCs. Project Zero uses motherboards with connectors on the underside of the PCB to let you hide all the PC’s internal cables behind the board. CES 2025’s Project Zero X took that to another level, with the whole board front covered in fancy heat sinks and the usual rear-edge panel of I/O ports—for monitor, audio, USB, and the like—relocated to the actual back of the board too, letting you put this PC, say, up against a wall with nary an external cable in sight, either. Predictably, though, Project Zero X has not seen the light of day beyond a trade show. The board we saw is highly proprietary, as was the outer chassis. With no sign of new Zero X-style boards or cases, the original “Zero” is all you can buy today. We’ll be on the lookout for any Zero X developments at CES 2026, though. —John Burek Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 impressed us at CES 2025 and again in May when we reviewed it. This gaming-focused tablet is small yet powerful, thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor with a dedicated vapor chamber to manage thermals and 12GB of RAM to run applications. We really like its pixel-rich screen, which measures 8.8 inches and has 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming action. In our review, we called it a “small tablet with big power,” and that’s exactly the experience it delivers at a reasonable $389. —Iyaz Akhtar The HMD Offgrid showed a lot of promise at its CES 2025 debut. This puck provides basic satellite SOS functionality for any smartphone across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The idea is to allow for connectivity in backcountry regions where traditional cell service isn’t available, enabling emergency communications if needed. While the puck itself is inexpensive at $149.99, the associated service fees tally up quickly, according to subscriber reviews. Moreover, those who purchased and used the Offgrid suggest that customer support is limited and connectivity is inconsistent. Although the product is still available for sale, it appears that it never gained traction. The good news is that many US-based smartphone users have access to emergency satellite-based SOS services from their carrier, or even directly from Apple (if they have an iPhone). —Eric Zeman For something as seemingly future-tech as a robotic arm on a vacuum, the Saros Z70 didn't take long to come to market. I reviewed it mere months after it wowed us at CES. In practice, the robot arm needs another generation or two to bake, as it currently only works with a few objects and only on hard floors. It's more of a novelty than a useful extra, and the underlying robot vacuum itself isn't worth the premium $2,599 list price. —Andrew Gebhart The Ultraloq Bolt Mission isn't out yet. Ultraloq is still around, and so we might find out more about this lock and its release date at the upcoming show. It still sounds cool, with its unique combination of ultrawide-band and NFC tech that lets your door sense your precise location for automatic unlocking. The company's name holds prestige, as it has another lock on top of our current best list. So, I'm holding out hope that this one hits retailers soon and lives up to its promise, even if the eventual delivery is later than we initially hoped. —Andrew Gebhart Combining noise cancelling with a comfortable design, the $349 Ozlo Sleepbuds are meant to help you seal yourself away from the world when it's time to get some shuteye. They did indeed launch after impressing us at CES. Two of our sister sites, ZDNET and Mashable, have reviewed the buds. Ozlo won an Editors' Choice award from the former and a score of 3.8 (out of five) from the latter, with both praising their comfort and docking them for the slow launch of their promised sleep tracking feature. —Andrew Gebhart Adding to the growing category of smart rings with cool new features like taking an ECG and detecting atrial fibrillation from your finger, the Circular Ring 2 was also promising at CES for its simplified, app-based system for judging your ring size. The Circular Ring 2 did come to fruition in 2025, but our sister site ZDNET noted some meaningful shortcomings that made its appealing $249 price less attractive, such as a laggy app, slow syncing, and inaccurate data. —Andrew Gebhart The XReal One Pro stood out at CES 2025 for its still-impressive 57-degree field of view, but that isn’t why it ended up earning our Editors’ Choice for AR smart glasses, or why it’s become a regular part of my travel gear. Its head-tracking enables an ultra-wide mode that simulates a 3,840-by-1,080 monitor, which is big enough that you'll need to turn your head to see everything. It’s incredibly useful if, like me, you need either two monitors or an ultrawide to get any work done. XReal is working on more impressive projects, like the Android XR-powered Project Aura development kit. But for now, the XReal One Pro is just an excellent wearable display to use away from your desk. —Will Greenwald These over-ear headphones from JBL packed a wireless transmitter in the case, allowing you to stream audio content from just about any source. Think airplane in-seat entertainment systems or even your record player at home. As long as you have a 3.5mm or USB-C port available, you can pair the JBL Tour One M3 headphones and enjoy. This feature led to their award and CES 2025, and we still found it compelling once the headphones reached the market in April. But connectivity isn’t everything: The Tour One M3 headphones have 40mm Mica Dome drivers that produce rich sound, eight microphones to handle calls, active noise cancellation, lossless audio, and spatial sound. The noise cancellation wasn’t the best we’ve tested, but it was decent enough. In our review, we also appreciated the extensive 70 hours of battery life per charge and their support for new Bluetooth technologies, like Auracast. Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves. If anything, I ended up liking it even more, awarding it 4.5 stars and an Editors’ Choice for its picture quality. It’s the brightest OLED I’ve ever tested and looks fantastic. I’d still recommend LG’s C5 (another Editors’ Choice, and the successor to the C4 I use at home) to most shoppers for its also-excellent picture and significantly lower price. —Will Greenwald Honda’s two funky electric cars are currently in development, and the SUV model is on track for a 2026 North American launch, Honda tells us. In October, the Japanese automaker unveiled an updated prototype of it in Japan—and the sleek, futuristic silhouette would certainly make waves on the road. The Saloon, a sedan model that’s likely to be less popular in the US, has been pushed back to 2027. —Emily Forlini Last year's top AI announcement from CES wasn't a chatbot or an AI-infused gadget. Instead, it was a unique foundation model, Nvidia Cosmos, which was developed as the first "world foundation model" built not for generating images or carrying on conversations, but to simulate and replicate the physical world to train future robots, self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous tech. Instead of real-world training in closed courses and lab conditions, this model would accurately replicate those conditions virtually, allowing robots to be trained virtually. As we said last year, this virtual sandbox "could be the platform that enables future CES innovators...for years to come." One year later and this ambitious project has matured considerably. Since that CES announcement, the model has been released as open source for easier downloading and deployment. Major updates have introduced prediction capabilities, embedded reasoning agents, controllable world generation, and support for large-scale synthetic data generation. And companies are already taking advantage of it. Top robotics and AV companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, and Uber, were early adopters of the platform, and it's part of the training and simulation loop for many more major robotics and autonomous vehicle programs. It may not be the kind of flashy consumer-facing technology that people see in reviews and ads, but it's already a major part of the future that's being built.—Brian Westover The Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV demonstrated its mettle in our testing, following up on its Best of CES 2025 with a four-star review and a PCMag Editors’ Choice. It has proven itself a capable and far more cost-effective alternative to the Pro Display XDR, which has the same screen size and resolution, although not quite matching the elite performance of Apple’s 6K flagship monitor. We’ll see how the PA32QCV stacks up against a new wave of 6K displays now coming through PC Labs. —Tony Hoffman The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D looked impressive on paper when it was announced during CES last year. When it launched in April 2025, test results showed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to be arguably the fastest consumer processor of the year. In gaming, it has no real competitor, and only the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K can offer competition against the 9950X3D in non-gaming workloads. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains the fastest CPU for consumers to date, and there are no signs of a new strong competitor emerging soon, so the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is set to hold this position for some time to come. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton Following up on the elite-performing but energy-hogging Editors’ Choice Crucial T700 and T705, which require substantial heatsinks to avoid thermal throttling, Micron’s latest PCI Express 5.0 SSD, the Crucial P510, is a more mainstream, power-efficient model that ships with a simple heat spreader. While the P510 is a capable model, its performance numbers were more sedate than its predecessors in our testing, allowing Sandisk’s WD Black SN8100, which combines energy efficiency with record-setting benchmark numbers, to wrest PCMag’s PCI Express 5 SSD crown away from the Crucial line. —Tony Hoffman Our favorite PC DIY product at CES 2025, this Corsair case didn’t take long to get into our hands and on the market. The Frame 4000D received a four-star rating in our February review, and the chassis proved to be a solid entry, thanks to its unique front panel and easy build experience. It’s something of a budget model, and even more so since launch. Discounted widely at this writing to $99 and equipped with three ARGB fans, it’s a good bet for a first-time PC builder these price-sensitive days. —John Burek Flint has not posted any news on its site since December 2024—right before last CES—but that’s not because it’s gone belly up like startups tend to do. Quite the opposite. The Singapore-based company started producing its first two battery products in early 2025, CEO and Founder Carlos Charles tells us, and has “collaborations with leading brands, including Logitech, Amazon Devices, Apple, and others.” More details to come at CES 2026. —Emily Forlini One of the oddest gadgets to get attention at the show is Kirin’s electric spoon, which sends a low-intensity electric current through your tongue to make salty and umami flavors pop more without using as much actual salt. It’s an interesting idea, and as someone who’s licked his share of 9-volt batteries, I see the logic behind it. And, as far as I can tell from the slew of CES 2025 news stories highlighting it and very little other English-language coverage, it never came to this side of the Pacific. Vendors on eBay are selling it for $200 to $300 if you really want to get one, though. I’m more of a Kiuichi man than a Kirin one myself, anyway. —Will Greenwald Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

The Circular Ring 2 did come to fruition in 2025, but our sister site ZDNET noted some meaningful shortcomings that made its appealing $249 price less attractive, such as a laggy app, slow syncing, and inaccurate data. —Andrew Gebhart The XReal One Pro stood out at CES 2025 for its still-impressive 57-degree field of view, but that isn’t why it ended up earning our Editors’ Choice for AR smart glasses, or why it’s become a regular part of my travel gear. Its head-tracking enables an ultra-wide mode that simulates a 3,840-by-1,080 monitor, which is big enough that you'll need to turn your head to see everything. It’s incredibly useful if, like me, you need either two monitors or an ultrawide to get any work done. XReal is working on more impressive projects, like the Android XR-powered Project Aura development kit. But for now, the XReal One Pro is just an excellent wearable display to use away from your desk. —Will Greenwald These over-ear headphones from JBL packed a wireless transmitter in the case, allowing you to stream audio content from just about any source. Think airplane in-seat entertainment systems or even your record player at home. As long as you have a 3.5mm or USB-C port available, you can pair the JBL Tour One M3 headphones and enjoy. This feature led to their award and CES 2025, and we still found it compelling once the headphones reached the market in April. But connectivity isn’t everything: The Tour One M3 headphones have 40mm Mica Dome drivers that produce rich sound, eight microphones to handle calls, active noise cancellation, lossless audio, and spatial sound. The noise cancellation wasn’t the best we’ve tested, but it was decent enough. In our review, we also appreciated the extensive 70 hours of battery life per charge and their support for new Bluetooth technologies, like Auracast. Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves. If anything, I ended up liking it even more, awarding it 4.5 stars and an Editors’ Choice for its picture quality. It’s the brightest OLED I’ve ever tested and looks fantastic. I’d still recommend LG’s C5 (another Editors’ Choice, and the successor to the C4 I use at home) to most shoppers for its also-excellent picture and significantly lower price. —Will Greenwald Honda’s two funky electric cars are currently in development, and the SUV model is on track for a 2026 North American launch, Honda tells us. In October, the Japanese automaker unveiled an updated prototype of it in Japan—and the sleek, futuristic silhouette would certainly make waves on the road. The Saloon, a sedan model that’s likely to be less popular in the US, has been pushed back to 2027. —Emily Forlini Last year's top AI announcement from CES wasn't a chatbot or an AI-infused gadget. Instead, it was a unique foundation model, Nvidia Cosmos, which was developed as the first "world foundation model" built not for generating images or carrying on conversations, but to simulate and replicate the physical world to train future robots, self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous tech. Instead of real-world training in closed courses and lab conditions, this model would accurately replicate those conditions virtually, allowing robots to be trained virtually. As we said last year, this virtual sandbox "could be the platform that enables future CES innovators...for years to come." One year later and this ambitious project has matured considerably. Since that CES announcement, the model has been released as open source for easier downloading and deployment. Major updates have introduced prediction capabilities, embedded reasoning agents, controllable world generation, and support for large-scale synthetic data generation. And companies are already taking advantage of it. Top robotics and AV companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, and Uber, were early adopters of the platform, and it's part of the training and simulation loop for many more major robotics and autonomous vehicle programs. It may not be the kind of flashy consumer-facing technology that people see in reviews and ads, but it's already a major part of the future that's being built.—Brian Westover The Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV demonstrated its mettle in our testing, following up on its Best of CES 2025 with a four-star review and a PCMag Editors’ Choice. It has proven itself a capable and far more cost-effective alternative to the Pro Display XDR, which has the same screen size and resolution, although not quite matching the elite performance of Apple’s 6K flagship monitor. We’ll see how the PA32QCV stacks up against a new wave of 6K displays now coming through PC Labs. —Tony Hoffman The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D looked impressive on paper when it was announced during CES last year. When it launched in April 2025, test results showed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to be arguably the fastest consumer processor of the year. In gaming, it has no real competitor, and only the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K can offer competition against the 9950X3D in non-gaming workloads. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains the fastest CPU for consumers to date, and there are no signs of a new strong competitor emerging soon, so the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is set to hold this position for some time to come. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton Following up on the elite-performing but energy-hogging Editors’ Choice Crucial T700 and T705, which require substantial heatsinks to avoid thermal throttling, Micron’s latest PCI Express 5.0 SSD, the Crucial P510, is a more mainstream, power-efficient model that ships with a simple heat spreader. While the P510 is a capable model, its performance numbers were more sedate than its predecessors in our testing, allowing Sandisk’s WD Black SN8100, which combines energy efficiency with record-setting benchmark numbers, to wrest PCMag’s PCI Express 5 SSD crown away from the Crucial line. —Tony Hoffman Our favorite PC DIY product at CES 2025, this Corsair case didn’t take long to get into our hands and on the market. The Frame 4000D received a four-star rating in our February review, and the chassis proved to be a solid entry, thanks to its unique front panel and easy build experience. It’s something of a budget model, and even more so since launch. Discounted widely at this writing to $99 and equipped with three ARGB fans, it’s a good bet for a first-time PC builder these price-sensitive days. —John Burek Flint has not posted any news on its site since December 2024—right before last CES—but that’s not because it’s gone belly up like startups tend to do. Quite the opposite. The Singapore-based company started producing its first two battery products in early 2025, CEO and Founder Carlos Charles tells us, and has “collaborations with leading brands, including Logitech, Amazon Devices, Apple, and others.” More details to come at CES 2026. —Emily Forlini One of the oddest gadgets to get attention at the show is Kirin’s electric spoon, which sends a low-intensity electric current through your tongue to make salty and umami flavors pop more without using as much actual salt. It’s an interesting idea, and as someone who’s licked his share of 9-volt batteries, I see the logic behind it. And, as far as I can tell from the slew of CES 2025 news stories highlighting it and very little other English-language coverage, it never came to this side of the Pacific. Vendors on eBay are selling it for $200 to $300 if you really want to get one, though. I’m more of a Kiuichi man than a Kirin one myself, anyway. —Will Greenwald Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Title: The Best Products of CES 2025: Where Are They Now?

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. It's been a wild year for tech innovation, and last January we previewed many of its most compelling new products at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As always, we searched the halls and rooms far and wide to examine cutting-edge gadgets and prototypes from more than 4,000 companies. To wrap up the show, we brought you our definitive list of the Best Tech of CES 2025—the 21 products that delighted us the most, and seemed destined to influence the rest of the industry in the months and years to come. CES is once again just a few days away, and we're all set to fly to Las Vegas. (Indeed, our joint digital media division, CNET Group, is choosing the official CES 2026 best-in-show winners, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association.) But before we pack our bags, we asked our experts to look back at the best innovations they picked from last year's show. We wanted answers to the most critical questions: What were our choices like in the real world as actual production models? Did they measure up when we tested them, or did they disappoint? Did they even come out at all? Here's what our experts discovered. When we first saw the Asus Zenbook A14, we were impressed by its slim, lightweight design, distinctive magnesium-alloy construction and Ceraluminum design, and long-lasting battery—enough to name it the best laptop of CES 2025. When we reviewed it in May, I was still wowed by all of those details, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus was a bit underwhelming, even for a Copilot+ PC. But even with low test scores, the Zenbook A14 still earned a 4-star rating as an excellent ultraportable system. It may not have won an Editors' Choice award, but it's currently listed as both the Best Windows Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000 and the Best Budget OLED Laptop, making it a smart buy for many.—Brian Westover We first got a look at the (confusingly named) Vision X AI 2nd at Computex 2024, before seeing it again in a more developed state at CES. It's a sizable and powerful gaming desktop in its own right, but its calling card is a 13-inch touch display on the front panel. This full HD panel can be used to show system diagnostics, apps, or even as a second monitor. The "AI" and "2nd" in its name refer to the NPU-bearing Arrow Lake 200 processors inside, while top-end Nvidia GPUs power gaming and graphics workloads. The main update about how this fared in 2025? It finally went on sale as a finished product, though stock is limited and configurations cost many thousands of dollars. (MSI is currently selling one model on its website for $5,499). We didn't review it ourselves yet, but it is now available for interested enthusiasts. —Matt Buzzi The Lenovo Legion Go S is a system full of potential, but when I finally got my hands on the Windows 11-powered handheld, its gaming performance ultimately let me down. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor proved too underpowered to deliver substantial gains over its predecessor and inherited much of its predecessor's clunkiness. However, Lenovo rectified most of the system’s flaws with the release of a SteamOS variant. With Windows 11 out of the picture, games performed far better than they did on the Windows-powered Go S, and it’s our recommendation for Steam Deck users looking to upgrade their system. —Zackery Cuevas MSI’s Project Zero X was an experimental “what next?” iteration on the company’s Project Zero, an initiative for PC building that enables super-minimalist, clean-looking desktop PCs. Project Zero uses motherboards with connectors on the underside of the PCB to let you hide all the PC’s internal cables behind the board. CES 2025’s Project Zero X took that to another level, with the whole board front covered in fancy heat sinks and the usual rear-edge panel of I/O ports—for monitor, audio, USB, and the like—relocated to the actual back of the board too, letting you put this PC, say, up against a wall with nary an external cable in sight, either. Predictably, though, Project Zero X has not seen the light of day beyond a trade show. The board we saw is highly proprietary, as was the outer chassis. With no sign of new Zero X-style boards or cases, the original “Zero” is all you can buy today. We’ll be on the lookout for any Zero X developments at CES 2026, though. —John Burek Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 impressed us at CES 2025 and again in May when we reviewed it. This gaming-focused tablet is small yet powerful, thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor with a dedicated vapor chamber to manage thermals and 12GB of RAM to run applications. We really like its pixel-rich screen, which measures 8.8 inches and has 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming action. In our review, we called it a “small tablet with big power,” and that’s exactly the experience it delivers at a reasonable $389. —Iyaz Akhtar The HMD Offgrid showed a lot of promise at its CES 2025 debut. This puck provides basic satellite SOS functionality for any smartphone across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The idea is to allow for connectivity in backcountry regions where traditional cell service isn’t available, enabling emergency communications if needed. While the puck itself is inexpensive at $149.99, the associated service fees tally up quickly, according to subscriber reviews. Moreover, those who purchased and used the Offgrid suggest that customer support is limited and connectivity is inconsistent. Although the product is still available for sale, it appears that it never gained traction. The good news is that many US-based smartphone users have access to emergency satellite-based SOS services from their carrier, or even directly from Apple (if they have an iPhone). —Eric Zeman For something as seemingly future-tech as a robotic arm on a vacuum, the Saros Z70 didn't take long to come to market. I reviewed it mere months after it wowed us at CES. In practice, the robot arm needs another generation or two to bake, as it currently only works with a few objects and only on hard floors. It's more of a novelty than a useful extra, and the underlying robot vacuum itself isn't worth the premium $2,599 list price. —Andrew Gebhart The Ultraloq Bolt Mission isn't out yet. Ultraloq is still around, and so we might find out more about this lock and its release date at the upcoming show. It still sounds cool, with its unique combination of ultrawide-band and NFC tech that lets your door sense your precise location for automatic unlocking. The company's name holds prestige, as it has another lock on top of our current best list. So, I'm holding out hope that this one hits retailers soon and lives up to its promise, even if the eventual delivery is later than we initially hoped. —Andrew Gebhart Combining noise cancelling with a comfortable design, the $349 Ozlo Sleepbuds are meant to help you seal yourself away from the world when it's time to get some shuteye. They did indeed launch after impressing us at CES. Two of our sister sites, ZDNET and Mashable, have reviewed the buds. Ozlo won an Editors' Choice award from the former and a score of 3.8 (out of five) from the latter, with both praising their comfort and docking them for the slow launch of their promised sleep tracking feature. —Andrew Gebhart Adding to the growing category of smart rings with cool new features like taking an ECG and detecting atrial fibrillation from your finger, the Circular Ring 2 was also promising at CES for its simplified, app-based system for judging your ring size.

Title: World Markets Have Outrun Wall Street by a Decent Margin

The stock market has treated US investors well this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 up about 17%. But the Financial Times reports something of a surprise: World markets have done significantly better. The MSCI ex-US index, which excludes American companies from its basket of international stocks, is up 29%—the biggest performance gap since 2009. A number of factors appear to be at play, including sky-high US tech valuations, related fears of an AI bubble, and concerns over President Trump's tariff wars, explains Axios. "US equities are more expensive than lots of other equities, the growth trajectory is likely to be challenged, and everyone's got lots of them," Matthew Beesley of Jupiter Asset Management explains. His current diversification mantra on stocks is "anything but America." Investors have instead piled into long-neglected markets in China, Japan, Europe, and emerging economies, helped by a weaker dollar. China's main index has climbed 29% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng almost 28%. South Korea's Kospi has jumped more than 75%, driven by sharp rallies in tech firms Samsung and SK Hynix. Another factor is a fear that the Chinese start-up AI DeepSeek—which unveiled a large language model seen as a credible, cheaper rival to leading US AI systems—will challenge American dominance in the field. "The reason we lost that exuberance [about US stocks] was really … 'DeepSeek day,'" says Helen Jewell of BlackRock, referring to the day of the product's launch. "You had that sudden realization that 'too overweight the US' was not the way to build a portfolio."

Title: Standard Chartered Models XRP at $8 by 2026—Breaking Down the 315% Upside Case
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/30/standard-chartered-models-xrp-at-8-by-2026-breaking-down-the-315-upside-case/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T13:44:45Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com Standard Chartered’s crypto research team, led by Geoffrey Kendrick, recently predicted XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) could hit $8 by 2026—implying a substantial 325% increase from its current $1.88 price. This high-profile Standard Chartered XRP prediction is anchored on easing regulatory uncertainty and the launch of new spot XRP ETFs, which they argue will unleash pent-up demand. Skeptics note that XRP has underperformed despite this positive forecast. The token is trading around $1.88 today, down about 13% year-to-date, even after the SEC withdrew its appeal in Ripple’s lawsuit and multiple XRP ETFs crossed $1 billion in inflows. While institutional endorsement is noteworthy, reaching XRP $8 2026 will require near-perfect execution across multiple bullish factors. Travis Wolfe / Shutterstock.com Standard Chartered’s model specifically targets XRP at $8 by late 2026. Below are the catalysts behind the Geoffrey Kendrick XRP forecast. The cornerstone of the Standard Chartered XRP prediction is institutional ETF demand. In 2025, U.S. regulators approved several spot XRP ETFs from firms such as Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary. These products reduce the friction of buying XRP—pension funds and asset managers can now allocate through regulated wrappers. Standard Chartered predicts spot ETF launches would attract $4-8 billion into XRP throughout 2026. If such inflows materialize, the additional demand against XRP’s relatively fixed supply could drive prices sharply higher. Kendrick laid out a roadmap: $5.50 in 2025, then $8.00 in 2026, eventually reaching $12.50 by 2028. For comparison, XRP’s current circulating supply is about 57 billion coins. Even a few billion dollars of new buying would be a meaningful supply shock. If $5-10 billion flows into XRP ETFs over 12 months—similar to early Bitcoin ETF momentum—that sustained demand could push prices toward the $8 target. Another key assumption is that regulatory clouds will clear globally. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs dominated XRP’s narrative for years. In August 2025, the SEC withdrew its appeal, leaving Ripple to pay a $125 million settlement with the court affirming that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. That resolution removes a major legal overhang. Standard Chartered cites this clarity as a catalyst for adoption. When legal uncertainty disappears, capital that was sitting on the sidelines can finally allocate. The XRP Ledger’s real-world use is also rising. Over 300 banks and financial institutions across 45+ countries now partner with RippleNet. Some partners already use XRP for liquidity through ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) corridors. Ripple has launched the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin on XRPL. In just one year, RLUSD’s market cap climbed to about $1.3 billion, making it one of the top U.S.-regulated stablecoins. If XRPL processes $10-20 billion in cross-border payments annually by 2026, the demand for XRP as a bridge currency could multiply. XRP has a capped supply of 100 billion maximum with about 57 billion circulating. Standard Chartered points out that, unlike Bitcoin where new coins are mined daily, new XRP issuance from mining is zero—the supply is fixed. When more tokens move into ETF custody and long-term holders lock up supply, the available tokens for sale on exchanges shrink dramatically. leksiv / Shutterstock.com Skeptics have given several reasons why the XRP $8 prediction might be too aggressive. In 2025, XRP’s price action doesn’t fit the rosy picture. In late December, XRP is about 13% down year-to-date at $1.88, even after the SEC cleared Ripple and XRP ETFs launched. After some XRP ETF approvals in November 2025, the token actually dipped—XRP fell 4% on the day of one ETF launch, a classic example of how it underperforms despite good news. XRP has decades of banking partnerships that have failed to reliably push its price up. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s claim that Ripple could capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share has never translated into meaningful price appreciation. Banks use RippleNet’s messaging without holding XRP tokens, meaning adoption doesn’t automatically equal token demand. XRP’s role as a bridge currency faces stiff competition. Ethereum Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, Solana with sub-second settlement, and Stellar’s similar payment focus are also advancing. Banks exploring blockchain payments have options beyond XRP. A concrete math check is sobering. An $8-per-XRP price would imply a market capitalization of about $456 billion (57 billion tokens × $8). Today, XRP’s market cap is only about $107 billion at $1.88. So hitting XRP $8 2026 means roughly quadrupling the market cap—adding approximately $349 billion in value. By comparison, $456 billion would make XRP larger than almost every crypto except Bitcoin. For context, Ethereum currently sits around $356 billion. Achieving $456 billion would require massive capital inflows, far beyond the roughly $1.25 billion the XRP ETF complex has raised so far. Finally, broader conditions could spoil the run-up. Any global recession, stock market crash, or crypto winter would make speculative gains unlikely. During the 2022 crypto winter, Bitcoin fell 75% despite improving fundamentals, showing macro conditions matter more than narratives when capital is fleeing risk. Uuganbayar / Shutterstock.com To turn the Standard Chartered XRP prediction into reality, a perfect storm of factors must align. To turbocharge flows, a heavyweight like BlackRock needs to launch an XRP ETF. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion within a year. A BlackRock-backed XRP fund could legitimize XRP in a way smaller issuers can’t. When the world’s largest asset manager—managing over $10 trillion—endorses an asset, it would spark investors’ confidence, and could help XRP to reach $8 quickly. RLUSD could become a major on-ramp for institutions. RLUSD’s market cap has grown swiftly to $1.3 billion, but it remains small relative to competitors like USDC ($40+ billion). For the XRP $8 prediction to become reality, RLUSD needs to become a mainstream payment hub—perhaps reaching $10-20 billion in market cap. RippleNet needs to win real traffic. Garlinghouse’s claim of targeting 14% of SWIFT’s market share would imply over $20 trillion in annual payment flows. If Ripple can capture even 5-10% of global bank transfers using XRPL liquidity, that could create hefty XRP demand. In practice, this means many more financial institutions actively using XRP for cross-currency flows—not merely experimenting with RippleNet messaging. Concrete announcements like “Bank X now processes $500 million monthly through ODL using XRP” would validate the thesis. The Geoffrey Kendrick XRP scenario requires continued significant inflows. Kendrick’s model implied $4–8 billion in year one, but that would need to sustain or grow. So far, XRP ETFs accumulated about $1.25 billion. To reach $8, imagine annual ETF flows hit the $5–10 billion range—similar to the early Bitcoin ETF frenzy. Finally, markets must remain bullish or at least stable. To achieve XRP $8 2026, we’d likely need low interest rates, risk-on investor sentiment, and a stable global economy. If macro headwinds intensify, funds will avoid altcoins.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after two consecutive sessions of losses for major indexes; tech stocks have stabilized after slumping on Monday; gold and silver prices are surging after the precious metals posted steep declines to start the week; Facebook-parent Meta announced it acquired AI agent firm Manus. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are holding steady this morning after major indexes lost ground on Monday for the second straight session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were hovering near unchanged in recent trading. Bitcoin was at $87,900, up from an overnight low of around $87,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates and costs on other consumer loans, was at 4.14%, up from 4.12% at yesterday's close. Oil prices continued to climb amid tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up 0.3% at $58.30 per barrel, trading near their highest levels of the month. Shares of some of the world's biggest technology companies are back on firmer footing Tuesday after leading the market's downturn yesterday.Concerns about whether major tech companies will profit from massive investments in artificial intelligence have weighed on investor sentiment in recent months. In premarket trading Tuesday, Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 0.5%, after the stock fell 3.3% on Monday to lead Nasdaq decliners. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) inched higher after shedding more than 1% yesterday, while Palantir (PLTR) ticked higher after dropping more than 2% Monday and Oracle (ORCL) was little changed after sliding 1%. Gold and silver prices are bouncing back from the big declines posted yesterday after exchange operator CME Group made a key change to its metals contracts. Gold futures were recently up 1.7% at $4,415 an ounce, after sliding as low as $4,330 yesterday. Silver futures were up more than 7% this morning, at around $75.55 an ounce. After a weeks-long rally that had lifted the precious metals to a series of record highs, gold and silver plunged on Monday after CME raised its margin requirements for precious metals contracts. Higher margin requirements require traders to add money to accounts that insure against default, effectively raising their costs to trade the futures contracts. Traders will be watching today’s release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting for clues about the direction the Federal Reserve will take on interest rates in 2026. The minutes, which are set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, will provide more insight into the FOMC’s decision to cut the Fed's benchmark lending rate for a third straight meeting. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady when it meets in January, though rising unemployment levels, along with tame inflation readings, could put pressure on FOMC members to reduce borrowing costs again. Investors will also be monitoring home price data set to be released at 9 a.m. ET. Meta Platforms (META) announced it acquired Manus, a Singapore-based firm that develops autonomous general-purpose AI agents. In a release, Meta said that Manus agents are able to “independently execute complex tasks like market research, coding, and data analysis.” Meta said it would integrate Manus services into its offerings. The move by the Facebook parent company comes as it continues to make big investments in its AI business. Shares of Meta, which through Monday's close were up 13% in 2025, were little changed in premarket trading.

Investing After rocketing nearly $10 higher on Monday, shares of Micron Technology are up another $2.10 this morning. Sending You to Google News in 3 © RomanR / Shutterstock.com With gold rebounding about $55 this morning, mining stocks, like Newmont Corp. (NYSE: NEM), are up about $1.85. All after the overbought stock lost nearly $6 of value yesterday, with gold’s 4.5% pullback. Shares of SSR Mining (NASDAQ: SSRM) are up about 50 cents on the rebound. Even shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) are up about 80 cents on the news. Despite yesterday’s pullback in gold, we have to remember that growing geopolitical tension, economic uncertainty, expectations of further interest rate cuts, a weak dollar, and strong interest from central banks could send gold prices screaming even higher. In fact, as we noted just yesterday, Bank of America is targeting $5,000 by 2026. JPMorgan is targeting $5,055. HSBC analysts are targeting $5,000 by early 2026, too. Shares of Rocket Lab Corp. (NASDAQ: RKLB) are up about $2 a share in premarket. While the stock took a breather after a substantial run from $40.88 to nearly $80 a share, it’s seeing further upside. Helping, analysts at Needham recently raised their price target on RKLH to $90 from $63, with a buy rating. All after the U.S. Space Development Agency awarded RKLB a prime contract to design and manufacture 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, as noted in a press release. “Under the $816 million contract, Rocket Lab will deliver satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems,” as noted by Seeking Alpha. Recent earnings weren’t too shabby either. In its third quarter, the company’s revenue was up 48% year-over-year to $155.1 million. It also narrowed its Q3 EPS loss to -$0.03 from -$0.10 a year ago. Moving forward, the company guided for Q4 revenue of between $170 million and $180 million, as compared to expectations of $171 million. It’s also calling for an adjusted EBITDA loss of $23 million to $29 million. After rocketing nearly $10 higher on Monday, shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) are up another $2.10 this morning. As we noted the other day, CNBC reported the MU stock was gaining ground after DigiTimes reported that, “citing industry sources, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are raising prices for their fifth-generation high-bandwidth memory 3E chips by nearly 20% for 2026 deliveries.” This comes just days after Micron crushed earnings and guidance. That was after Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share. It also expects revenue to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter.

Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars spent, a surge in mental health concerns and thousands of jobs lost. The link between it all? Artificial intelligence, the buzzy yet controversial technology being depicted as the future or the stock market’s next bubble, depending on who you ask. Although AI has been a key technology behind the scenes for decades, the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022 pushed the tech to the frontlines. The rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini has gradually influenced online services used by millions every day, from Google search’s AI Mode to the AI chatbots built into Instagram and Amazon. In other words, AI is starting to reshape the front door to the internet. But 2025 was also the year AI expanded beyond our screens and began impacting national policy, global trade relations and the stock market. It also raised important questions about whether the tech should be trusted in our jobs, classrooms and relationships. That’s expected to continue in 2026. “In previous years, (AI) was a shiny new object… And I think this last year was a lot more serious uses of the technology,” said James Landay, co-founder and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “And I think people are waking up to actually understanding both some of the benefits and the risks.” Count President Donald Trump among AI’s biggest believers; the technology has been a cornerstone of his second term so far. For example, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, the posterchild of the AI boom, has become a fixture of Trump’s inner circle. And the president has used Nvidia’s and AMD’s AI processors as bargaining chips in the ongoing trade war with China. This year, Trump introduced an AI action plan aimed at stripping back regulation and boosting AI use in the government. He also signed multiple AI-related executive orders, including a controversial one seeking to block states from enforcing their own AI rules. The move was seen as a win for Silicon Valley, but online safety advocates fear it’ll enable tech companies to evade accountability for AI-related risks. Next year will likely see a legal fight over the order and states’ abilities to regulate AI — with some critics arguing it won’t hold up in court. The absence of broad AI guardrails has been in the national spotlight this year and not for good reason. A slew of reports and lawsuits this year have alleged that AI companions like ChatGPT and Character.AI have contributed to mental health episodes and, in some cases, suicide among teens. “Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.” That’s how ChatGPT is said to have responded when 16-year-old Adam Raine wrote that he wanted to leave a noose out in his room so that someone would find it and stop him before he committed suicide. Raine’s parents sued OpenAI in August alleging that the popular chatbot advised the teen on his suicide. OpenAI and Character.AI have since announced parental controls and other changes to improve teen safety, including removing the ability for teens to have back-and-forth conversations with chatbots on Character.AI’s app. Meta also plans to let parents block their children from chatting with AI characters on Instagram next year. But it’s not just teens; a growing number of reports have indicated that AI has contributed to isolation from loved ones and breaks from reality among adults, too. One man told CNN that ChatGPT convinced him he was making technological breakthroughs that turned out to be a delusion. OpenAI said it has worked with clinical mental health experts to enable ChatGPT to “better recognize and support people in moments of distress,” including by expanding access to crisis hotlines, pointing users towards professional help when needed and adding reminders to take breaks. Still, OpenAI has said it ultimately wants to “treat adult users like adults,” allowing them to personalize their chats and even discuss erotica with ChatGPT. Psychiatrist and lawyer Marlynn Wei told CNN that she expects AI chatbots “will increasingly become the first place people turn for emotional support,” further underscoring safety concerns. Young users are among the most likely to turn to AI for support, she said. “The limitations of general-purpose chatbots, including hallucinations, sycophancy, lack of confidentiality, lack of clinical judgment, and lack of reality testing, along with broader ethical and privacy concerns, will continue to create mental health risks,” she said via email. Mental health experts and safety advocates say they hope to see greater guardrails from tech companies, especially when it comes to young AI users. But they worry the fight over regulatory power between the states and the federal government will impact the implementation of such mandated safety measures. At the same time, huge investments are being poured into data centers and AI infrastructure. Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, among others, have spent tens of billions in capital expenditures this year alone, and McKinsey & Company expects companies to invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure globally by 2030. That surge in spending has sparked concerns both for consumers and for Wall Street. Some Americans have watched their electricity bills climb and job prospects sink due to AI, while some companies behind the AI boom have seen their stock reach new heights. The massive investments have also fueled worries that the hype and spending in AI is growing faster than the tech’s true value. That’s prompted investors to grill executives at Meta and Microsoft about future returns on their AI infrastructure investments during earnings calls this year. It doesn’t help that a relatively small group of companies have seemingly driven the investments, trading money and technology back and forth. Christina Melas-Kyriazi, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said it’s common for new transformative technologies to be “overbuilt.” The big question heading into 2026 is whether investors are prepared for the volatility that comes with it, especially since she says a market correction is “likely at some point.” But they’ll likely have more data at their disposal to help make those decisions, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a senior fellow for the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. He said more dashboards will likely emerge in 2026 to track how AI is impacting productivity and jobs. “The debate will shift from whether AI matters to how quickly its effects are diffusing, who is being left behind, and which complementary investments best turn AI capability into broad-based prosperity,” he said. This year, thousands of tech workers were left jobless as a wave of layoffs swept the industry. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, among other tech companies, made significant cuts to their staff, driven at least in part by AI. Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees in October in an effort to operate more leanly in the age of AI. Meta let 600 workers go from its AI division, following an earlier hiring spree, so that it, too, could be more nimble. Some believe AI will lead to more layoffs, while others say it’ll create fresh opportunities. But one thing is certain: More change is coming. “This was the year that we saw skill demands totally change when it comes to what is required to be able to pull off your job,” said Dan Roth, editor-in-chief of LinkedIn. “…And I think the answer for next year is it just accelerates.” CNN’s Matt Egan and John Towfighi contributed to this report.

Warren Buffett is to investing what Einstein was to physics, Edison was to invention, and Mozart was to music. There will never be another one like him, and you should pity anyone who says they aspire to be “the next Warren Buffett.” Whenever I hear someone talk about “the next Warren Buffett,” I think of Antonio Salieri, Mozart’s inferior rival, played brilliantly by F. Murray Abraham in the movie Amadeus. In the film’s climactic scene, Mozart dictates his Requiem to Salieri from his deathbed. As Salieri struggles to keep up with the genius pouring forth, his face is equal parts awestruck and ravaged. It is the face of a person who knows he is doomed—not to failure, but to something perhaps even worse: mediocrity. As we pause to honor the master’s legacy, however, it’s clear that Buffett’s oeuvre is in fact divided into two distinct periods. The first lasted from shortly after he graduated from Columbia Business School in 1951 as Ben Graham’s star pupil to the end of the dot.com bust. If you had invested in Buffett’s partnership in the early days and then rolled your money into Berkshire Hathaway when that old textile company became his investing vehicle, over the next fifty years you would have nearly 500 times more money than if you’d invested in the S&P 500. You don’t get a sense of how awesome, in the original sense of the word, that figure is until you translate the difference into actual dollars. A million dollars invested in the S&P from 1957 through 2007 would have been worth $166 million—but a million invested with Buffett would have been worth almost $81 billion. Fast forward another 18 years, and your $1 million with Buffett is now worth almost $428 billion. This is where the legend of Buffett’s genius rightly springs. What is less well known, however, and even less discussed, is that these first five decades account for more than 100% of Buffett’s career outperformance. While he beat the S&P by a factor of almost 500 in his first fifty years, he has underperformed it in the eighteen years since. As the chart below shows, a million dollars invested in the S&P from the end of 2007 through mid-December 2025 would today be worth $6.6 million, almost 25% more than the $5.3 million you would have earned in Berkshire’s stock. The data lead to an obvious conclusion. For most of the 21st century, Buffett’s record was mediocre—Salieriesque, one might say. How could this happen? How could a practitioner as driven and imaginative as Warren Buffett produce such genius, then become slightly below average? These questions are worth pursuing. To understand why Buffett excelled in the 20th century but hasn’t in the 21st will help us understand two things. First, what once made his style of value investing so good. Second, why he faltered, and how value investors must change if we want to excel in the digital age. I realize that by calling attention to these facts I am violating one of value investing’s cardinal commandments: Thou shalt have no other gods beside Warren Buffett. To those deeply immersed in it, value investing, invented by Ben Graham more than a century ago and passed directly to Buffett, resembles a religious order in many ways. It has many principles and precepts and a long list of dos and don’ts. Our discipline, we believe, distinguishes us from growth investors and momentum investors, whom we look down on as heathens. Unlike them, we think, we aren’t stock jockeys or herd followers. We have rules. We trust that these rules will lead us to outperform. And when we do outperform, we believe it is not a matter of luck, but of patiently applied skill. This fixity of purpose can lead to stilted and dogmatic thinking. To suggest that Buffett was Mozart in the first three-quarters of his investing career and then Salieri in his last quarter represents a kind of heresy to many in the value church. Fortunately, one of the many salutary things about value investing is that recourse to hard facts is another of its cardinal principles. Value investing has had one major reformation in its 100-year history, a reformation driven by Buffett himself. As Buffett’s two disparate records suggest, if we are to succeed in the digital age, value investors must again evolve. Like Buffett’s overall record, his magisterial performance in the late 20th century is in fact composed of two discrete periods. The first comes from what Chris Begg at East Coast Asset Management calls Buffett’s Value 1.0 days, when he invested in Ben Graham-like “cigar butts,” companies that were cheap not on the merits of their business quality but on their asset liquidation value. Early on, Buffett scored big with such fire-sale investments as Dempster Mill Manufacturing and National American Fire Insurance. His purchase of Berkshire Hathaway, a dying New England textile mill he bought because it was worth more dead than alive, was the very distillation of Ben Graham’s quantitative, defensive style. Berkshire in fact survives only because Buffett began to listen to his acerbic partner, Charlie Munger. Munger loathed Graham’s cigar-butt approach, referring to it over the years as “madness,” “a snare and a delusion,” and a discipline that “ignored relevant facts.” From the early days of their collaboration, Munger pressed Buffett to look at a business’s earning power rather than its liquidation value, and to use Berkshire as a holding company to invest in such companies. The real money, Munger argued, lay not in a business’s fire-sale value but in its ability to generate growing profits over its lifetime. Buffett embraced Munger’s style, and thus Value 2.0 was born. With its focus on good, growing businesses, Value 2.0 was as suited to the postwar world as Graham’s defensive Value 1.0 was suited to the Depression. The United States in the 1950s was prosperous and remarkably stable, and its business dynamics were resistant to material change. Television, for example, became the dominant mass medium after World War II, and TV itself was dominated by only three national networks for nearly forty years. The same was true of print media. Earlier in the 20th century, major cities like Washington, D.C., had more than 100 newspapers. By 1981, the city had only one, The Washington Post, and Berkshire was a major shareholder. As the 1950s became the 1960s, Buffett and Munger’s key insight into this ecosystem was as simple as it was brilliant. They didn’t label it as such, but in hindsight we can say they diagnosed and then invested in what might be called the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Only a few outlets dominated the media, giving them a chokehold on advertising dollars. Using these channels, dominant consumer-product companies could take incremental market share simply by outspending their rivals. If a company like Budweiser or Coca-Cola began with 50% more revenue than its nearest rival, Bud or Coke could spend the same percentage of revenue on advertising as Miller or Pepsi and still outspend them by 50%. Buffett and Munger understood and exploited this more quickly and more deeply than anyone else. Media companies like Disney and ABC and consumer product companies like General Foods became major Berkshire investments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as did the few big advertising agencies that supported the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Looking back, it’s remarkable how slow-moving and static competitive dynamics were in the late 20thcentury. Of course there was technological innovation—the silicon chip was commercialized in the 1950s, and on its back the transistor radio and then the mobile phone—but the companies that won in the marketplace were steady, grind-it-out growers in sectors where the battle lines had been drawn and it was easy to identify the commanding players. These sectors included not only media and consumer products but also banks, which often dominated their markets. Buffett loved banks and invested in them profitably for decades, and he extended his interest in financial services to other companies like American Express and GEICO, which combined the best of consumer product companies—brand identity—with the raw scale economies of large financial institutions. Given this, it’s no wonder Buffett came to land on the medieval term “moat” to describe competitive advantage. Buffett learned early on in Value 2.0 that companies with a solid, entrenched competitive position won, and kept winning—slowly but surely, year by year. Likewise, he learned to favor smart, cautious executives who deepened their moat but didn’t try to expand into new territory. Eisenhower, pushing the U.S. Army slowly but surely toward Germany in 1944, was the right archetype for Buffett. Napoleons made for good copy but almost always overreached. In the late 20th century, investing with this template proved extremely lucrative. Markets rewarded plodders and punished risk takers and innovators. When in 1985 Coca-Cola announced it was changing its formula to “New Coke,” its customers were so angry that Coke went back to the same mixture John Pemberton had come up with in 1886. As one of the three major national television networks, all ABC had to do was produce reasonably good programming to keep its hold on millions of American eyeballs. My favorite example of all is that of Scotch Tape, which was invented during the Depression by an engineer at 3M named Richard Drew. Despite its enormous mass-market appeal, no competitor tried to improve upon Scotch Tape for more than a generation after its introduction. Scotch Tape thus had the profitable niche of consumer adhesive to itself for thirty years. Can you imagine a company today maintaining its lead for thirty months, let alone thirty years, absent any innovation? As for investment in technology, Wall Street regarded it for much of the 20th century as a kind of social utility: It was wonderful for civilization, but it was terrible for stockholders. All too often, research and development spending in semiconductors and related technologies was deemed speculative or, just as bad, easily copied and therefore moatless. As a result, even into the late 1980s, good Value 2.0 investors like Peter Lynch dismissed tech stocks as a reliable way to make money. “For every single product in a hot industry,” Lynch wrote in One Up on Wall Street, “there are a thousand MIT graduates trying to figure out how to make it cheaper in Taiwan.” Then, sometime around the turn of the millennium, the world began to change. Ironically, the tipping point came right after the dot.com crash, which was the ultimate proof point to “good investors” that investing in tech stocks always ended poorly. What these investors failed to account for was the ineluctable power of Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law is as simple as it is profound: It stipulates that roughly every two years, computing power becomes twice as powerful with minimal incremental cost. Moore’s Law guaranteed that by the year 2000, computing power had become 30 million times more powerful than when semiconductors were commercialized in the 1950s. Thirty million times is a lot, but it wasn’t enough to generate the critical mass of a digital ecosystem. In 2000, for example, only 1% of the world’s population could access broadband internet, and only 15% could afford a cellphone. This goes a long way to explaining the dot.com crash—there simply wasn’t enough computing power to support the connected world we see around us today. However, Moore’s Law didn’t stop during or after the dot.com crash. Computing power became 30 million times more powerful between 2000 and 2002, then 60 million times more powerful between 2002 and 2004, and so on until sometime around 2010, it became strong enough to enable the technology-rich environment we now inhabit. Today, well more than half of the world’s population has both broadband access and a powerful smartphone. Today, much of the world searches, shops, chats, banks, and performs many other everyday activities online. Because consumers tend to standardize on a single application—Facebook for social media, Microsoft for office tools, Google for search—you also have tech companies that possess the customer loyalty and predictability that Buffett rightly craved. Suddenly, entire economic sectors became existentially threatened by digitally driven alternatives, and these threats extended to most of the hunting grounds that Buffett and Munger had for so long favored. Mass media, already disrupted by the advent of cable television, became even more fragmented as Google, YouTube, and Facebook usurped television’s dominion. In a fragmented media landscape, powerful brands like Coke and Budweiser could no longer press their advantage; it’s easy now to launch a niche brand using TikTok and Instagram. One of banks’ central pillars, its network of brick-and-mortar branches, is increasingly less relevant in a world that does much of its business digitally. Buffett and Munger found it hard to adjust to such changes—and at their age, who wouldn’t? Buffett was 73 when Google IPO’d. It’s difficult to fault him for not quite tuning in to the new narrative. On the other hand, at times Buffett demonstrated an almost willful resistance to the changes brought on by the digital age. He never learned how to use email, for example, and he gave up his flip phone for a smartphone only in 2020, thirteen years after the advent of the iPhone and four years after he invested in Apple. Exquisitely comfortable in the late 20th century ecosystem, he loved reading physical newspapers every morning and talking on the telephone from his office in the Midwest. Every year, he’d take the stage in Omaha for his annual meeting and drink his Cherry Cokes and eat his Dilly Bars. Munger would make a wisecrack, break off a chunk of See’s peanut brittle, and it was all good—until it wasn’t. Still, Buffett was too brilliant a business analyst not to grasp what was happening. He and Munger saw how digital businesses like Google were radically better businesses than even his best Value 2.0 investments. Coke sold sugar water, which had big margins, but to get to market Coke had to build bottling plants and establish a network of trucks and vending machines. When a software company wants to enter a new geographic market, its engineers simply write new code, hit “deploy,” and voila—the product is available around the globe, instantaneously and with almost no incremental costs. The result has been the rise of the most successful companies ever produced. Even though Coke was incorporated in 1892 and Alphabet was incorporated more than a century later, Alphabet now makes more than $100 billion in annual profit—nearly ten times more than Coca-Cola. In what amounted to an extemporaneous master class on the power of digital economics, Buffett acknowledged this superiority at his 2017 meeting. “This is a very different world than when Andrew Carnegie was building a steel mill and then using the earnings to build another steel mill and getting very rich in the process, or Rockefeller was building refineries and buying tank cars and everything,” Buffett told the crowd. “I don’t think people quite appreciate the difference. “Our capitalist system was built on tangible assets, but this asset-light model is so much better,” he continued. “Andrew Mellon would be absolutely baffled by looking at the high-cap companies now. I mean, the idea that you could create hundreds of billions of value, essentially without assets…” “Fast,” Munger interjected. “Fast, yeah,” Buffett agreed. “You literally don’t need any money to run the five tech companies that are worth collectively more than $2.5 trillion in the stock market, who have outpaced any number of those names that were familiar, if you looked at the Fortune 500 list 30 or 40 years ago, you know, whether it was Exxon or General Motors, or you name it.” This is all standard, brilliant Buffett stuff—but why, aside from Apple, did he never pull the trigger on these stocks? Over the last twenty years he has been consistently underweight technology stocks, and he forewent hundreds of billions of dollars of value creation in doing so. Having evolved so well from Value 1.0 to 2.0, why did he fail to evolve to Value 3.0? And if he had, would it have made his record better? The second question is easier to settle than the first. The answer to it is unquestionably yes—Berkshire Hathaway’s stock performance would have been materially better had he followed through on his observations about the superiority of tech’s business models and invested in more of them. When Buffett started buying Apple nearly a decade ago, if he had deployed excess cash (the cash he didn’t need for potential insurance claims) into each of the three mega-tech stocks besides Apple that he knew best—Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft—I estimate that Berkshire Hathaway’s market cap would not be the $1 trillion it is now, but at least $1.6 trillion. It’s important to note that this calculation incorporates only the market appreciation of these three stocks. If the market had capitalized Buffett’s “getting tech” and given Berkshire Hathaway’s stock a greater premium as a result, then Berkshire’s gain would have been greater. (Berkshire did buy $6.5 billion worth of Alphabet’s stock earlier this year, though it’s not clear whether it was Buffett or his lieutenants who pulled the trigger on the purchase). While rough, my estimates are not crazy. Buffett understood all three stocks well. He was close friends with Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, who explained the company’s competitive advantages to Buffett many times. At his 2017 annual meeting, Buffett admitted that he “blew it” by not investing in Amazon and Alphabet. Investing a big slug of his cash in these liquid, mega-cap stocks would have solved the “problem of large numbers” that some who seek to rationalize Buffett’s average latter-day record point to. And my estimate assumes that Buffett bought only a single slug of each. To those who say, “Buffett didn’t miss tech—he had Apple,” I would say two things. First, thank goodness Buffett invested in Apple—can you imagine what his recent record would look like if he hadn’t? Second, I would argue that by the time he invested in Apple the company was acting more like one of his mature, moated consumer products companies than it was a company we would recognize as a “tech company:” ambitious and forward-looking in its investment and R&D spending. When Buffett first bought Apple shares in 2016, it had transformed into a business that had much more in common with Coke and Gillette than it did Amazon or Alphabet. People forget that two important things happened in the years immediately before Berkshire began to buy Apple. First, Steve Jobs became terminally ill and was replaced in 2011 by Tim Cook. Suddenly, the design visionary was out, and the man whose main achievement was perfecting the company’s supply chain was in. While Jobs brought us the iPod and the iPhone, he also was responsible for the Lisa and the Newton, and he once almost bought Universal Music, a purchase that would have meant handing over cash or stock worth nearly Apple’s entire market capitalization at the time. That wasn’t going to happen under Cook. The quartermaster had replaced the field marshal. Salieri replaced Mozart, and this suited Buffett fine. Then, two years after the management change, Carl Icahn launched a proxy fight to force Apple to stop accumulating cash and start returning it to shareholders via massive share buybacks. Icahn never said it exactly like this, but the subtext was clear: With the genius gone and the iPhone bringing in billions, it was time to act like a mature consumer products company. Cook had already begun buying back stock, but Icahn wanted him to do much more, and Cook eventually obliged. By 2015, Cook was saying things like, “By and large, my view is for cash that we don’t need, with some level of buffer, we want to give it back. We’re not hoarders.” The next year, Buffett started buying shares. Post-Jobs, Apple was exactly the kind of company Buffett understood and loved. It had a moat, it worked hard to expand that moat, but beyond that it wasn’t terribly ambitious. A technocrat, not an innovator, was in charge. You can easily see this in not only the tone of Cook’s remarks but in his actions. What is Apple’s biggest innovation since Jobs died in 2011? The Apple Watch and—it’s almost sad to say it—AirPods? As you can see from the accompanying chart, Apple ranks near the bottom of the Magnificent Seven in terms of research and development spending as a percentage of sales. Alphabet and Amazon spend nearly twice as much, and Meta spends three times more. It’s hard to argue that Cook’s plan hasn’t worked. The stock has risen more than tenfold since Buffett began buying it, and Apple remains the second-most-valuable company in the world. But Microsoft is up eight-and-a-half times since Buffett began buying Apple; Amazon is up nearly sevenfold; and Alphabet has octupled. All have dramatically outperformed the market, and Buffett had plenty of evidence almost a decade ago that they would. He understood their competitive advantages ago; he admitted he blew it by not buying them; but he didn’t. Why? Because like other good late 20th century investors, Buffett learned that reinvestment, especially in technology, leads to heartbreak rather than value creation. In his era, companies that reinvested often destroyed value rather than created it. But that is not the era we live in today. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and hundreds of other smaller and lesser-known companies all reinvest a double-digit percentage of their revenues in research and development. The superiority of digital business models permits them to. Without a cost of goods sold—zeros and ones are metaphysical rather than physical—what an average tech company spends on R&D exceeds the entire profit margin of the average American corporation by 50%. Today, unlike a generation ago, there’s abundant evidence that companies which invest in the future will and should be rewarded. Amazon’s average P/E multiple has averaged more than 200x since it went public, but the stock continues to appreciate. Why? Because investors continue to believe that Amazon is depressing current profits to maximize future ones. It’s a “jam tomorrow” company rather than a “jam today” one. Apple is more jam today. It continues to return capital, which is fine, but you don’t get something for nothing. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have plowed billions of profits into new industries like cloud computing, driverless cars, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence; Apple is not a major player in any of these mega-trends. The iPhone accounts for most Apple’s profits. What happens if geopolitical friction impairs the company’s smartphone supply chain, which is still heavily dependent on China? And what happens to Apple if worldwide demand for the iPhone falters, which it perhaps already has? Economic nationalism has begun to cause the Chinese to turn to domestic devices, and China accounts for 20% of the company’s sales. If the courts rule that Google can no longer pay Apple to be its default search engine, almost a quarter of Apple’s profit evaporates. These vulnerabilities illustrate the wisdom of Elon Musk’s 2018 dictum that “moats are lame. If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation.” The wonderful thing about the early 21st century is that, unlike Buffett, we don’t have to choose between mature, moated companies on the one hand and high growth but speculative ones on the other. Today, in a Value 3.0 world, we can have moats and brands and high growth as well. Despite its enormous size, big tech continues to grow its topline at multiples of the growth rate of the American economy. Amazon has been in business for more than a generation but it still has only a single-digit domestic market share of both retail sales and computing operations. The company’s market cap is so large that we tend to forget such statistics, but like age, market cap turns out to be just a number. The investment landscape changed once after World War II, when American business was stable and slowly growing and Buffett could invest with confidence in dominant, moated enterprises. It has now changed again with the advent of huge, winner-take-most digital platform companies—not just the mega-tech companies, but dozens of others like Intuit and Adobe, ARM and Atlassian, Uber and Airbnb. All these companies dominate their niche as much as Coke and Bud did in their day. Because the economy has changed, as value investors we must change with it. Part of this recalibration needs to be quantitative. We need to adjust our metrics to account for companies like Amazon, who spend on the future through the income statement. Such spending penalizes current earnings and makes its stock appear more expensive, but, as GEICO did when Buffett bought the company 30 years ago, the spending boosts future earnings. There’s another, broader recalibration we must also undertake. Just as Munger told Buffett when they were young men, Value 1.0 was useful in its time but, as business and markets evolved, it ignored certain relevant facts. With its emphasis on milking a business rather than reinvesting in it, isn’t it time to say the same regarding Value 2.0? In the end, whether Buffett “missed tech” or not is irrelevant. He has now all but removed himself from the great arena of the stock market, and the best requiem we can give him is to ask how we should proceed ourselves. The only thing more pitiful than hearing about “the next Warren Buffett” is hearing his disciples parroting Buffetisms as if were still 1967, 1987, or even 1997. Many of these disciples have failed to apply the maestro’s maxims to the present day’s radically altered business landscape. “My favorite holding period is forever,” Buffett has said, and it’s a good axiom—but should we be holding businesses like Coke and Wells Fargo, whose best days are likely behind them, or ones like Alphabet and Microsoft? “Price is what you pay, value is what you get,” Buffett has said, and that’s also true—but what does the saying mean in the context of a tech company’s ambitious spending and consequently high P/E ratio? Conversely, what does it mean for a business like Kraft Heinz, a Buffett holding that has systematically failed to reinvest and has thus systematically eroded its business value? Kraft Heinz has so thoroughly failed, in fact, that it’s resorting to the ultimate refuge of corporate scoundrels: a breakup. When I go to Berkshire meetings these days or am around value investors generally, I hear these axioms endlessly repeated, but with little thought to their contemporary meaning. It’s like members of an old, established religion mumbling a catechism without thinking about its relevance to their world today. Buffett and Munger never meant their wisdom to be suspended in amber. They were far more flexible and sophisticated thinkers than that. Value investors need to be, too. Fortunately, as the 21st century enters its second generation, more and more value investors are adapting their templates to a Value 3.0 world. For every holdout like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who continues to rail against tech’s high valuations while owning coal miners and annuity companies, there are investors like Tom Gayner at Markel, Bill Nygren at Oakmark, and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital. They have all used a value-based discipline to make successful investments in tech. My favorite is Lew Sanders, the former CEO of Value 1.0 paragon Sanford Bernstein. During the Great Financial Crisis, Sanders bought banks because they looked cheap using traditional value metrics. Many were in fact worthless, and Bernstein fired him. Forced to start over with his own firm, Sanders decided that the world had changed. He changed with it: His top positions now include Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Taiwan Semiconductor.

Warren Buffett is to investing what Einstein was to physics, Edison was to invention, and Mozart was to music. There will never be another one like him, and you should pity anyone who says they aspire to be “the next Warren Buffett.” Whenever I hear someone talk about “the next Warren Buffett,” I think of Antonio Salieri, Mozart’s inferior rival, played brilliantly by F. Murray Abraham in the movie Amadeus. In the film’s climactic scene, Mozart dictates his Requiem to Salieri from his deathbed. As Salieri struggles to keep up with the genius pouring forth, his face is equal parts awestruck and ravaged. It is the face of a person who knows he is doomed—not to failure, but to something perhaps even worse: mediocrity. As we pause to honor the master’s legacy, however, it’s clear that Buffett’s oeuvre is in fact divided into two distinct periods. The first lasted from shortly after he graduated from Columbia Business School in 1951 as Ben Graham’s star pupil to the end of the dot.com bust. If you had invested in Buffett’s partnership in the early days and then rolled your money into Berkshire Hathaway when that old textile company became his investing vehicle, over the next fifty years you would have nearly 500 times more money than if you’d invested in the S&P 500. You don’t get a sense of how awesome, in the original sense of the word, that figure is until you translate the difference into actual dollars. A million dollars invested in the S&P from 1957 through 2007 would have been worth $166 million—but a million invested with Buffett would have been worth almost $81 billion. Fast forward another 18 years, and your $1 million with Buffett is now worth almost $428 billion. This is where the legend of Buffett’s genius rightly springs. What is less well known, however, and even less discussed, is that these first five decades account for more than 100% of Buffett’s career outperformance. While he beat the S&P by a factor of almost 500 in his first fifty years, he has underperformed it in the eighteen years since. As the chart below shows, a million dollars invested in the S&P from the end of 2007 through mid-December 2025 would today be worth $6.6 million, almost 25% more than the $5.3 million you would have earned in Berkshire’s stock. The data lead to an obvious conclusion. For most of the 21st century, Buffett’s record was mediocre—Salieriesque, one might say. How could this happen? How could a practitioner as driven and imaginative as Warren Buffett produce such genius, then become slightly below average? These questions are worth pursuing. To understand why Buffett excelled in the 20th century but hasn’t in the 21st will help us understand two things. First, what once made his style of value investing so good. Second, why he faltered, and how value investors must change if we want to excel in the digital age. I realize that by calling attention to these facts I am violating one of value investing’s cardinal commandments: Thou shalt have no other gods beside Warren Buffett. To those deeply immersed in it, value investing, invented by Ben Graham more than a century ago and passed directly to Buffett, resembles a religious order in many ways.

Unlike them, we think, we aren’t stock jockeys or herd followers. We have rules. We trust that these rules will lead us to outperform. And when we do outperform, we believe it is not a matter of luck, but of patiently applied skill. This fixity of purpose can lead to stilted and dogmatic thinking. To suggest that Buffett was Mozart in the first three-quarters of his investing career and then Salieri in his last quarter represents a kind of heresy to many in the value church. Fortunately, one of the many salutary things about value investing is that recourse to hard facts is another of its cardinal principles. Value investing has had one major reformation in its 100-year history, a reformation driven by Buffett himself. As Buffett’s two disparate records suggest, if we are to succeed in the digital age, value investors must again evolve. Like Buffett’s overall record, his magisterial performance in the late 20th century is in fact composed of two discrete periods.

With its focus on good, growing businesses, Value 2.0 was as suited to the postwar world as Graham’s defensive Value 1.0 was suited to the Depression. The United States in the 1950s was prosperous and remarkably stable, and its business dynamics were resistant to material change. Television, for example, became the dominant mass medium after World War II, and TV itself was dominated by only three national networks for nearly forty years. The same was true of print media.

If a company like Budweiser or Coca-Cola began with 50% more revenue than its nearest rival, Bud or Coke could spend the same percentage of revenue on advertising as Miller or Pepsi and still outspend them by 50%. Buffett and Munger understood and exploited this more quickly and more deeply than anyone else. Media companies like Disney and ABC and consumer product companies like General Foods became major Berkshire investments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as did the few big advertising agencies that supported the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Looking back, it’s remarkable how slow-moving and static competitive dynamics were in the late 20thcentury. Of course there was technological innovation—the silicon chip was commercialized in the 1950s, and on its back the transistor radio and then the mobile phone—but the companies that won in the marketplace were steady, grind-it-out growers in sectors where the battle lines had been drawn and it was easy to identify the commanding players. These sectors included not only media and consumer products but also banks, which often dominated their markets. Buffett loved banks and invested in them profitably for decades, and he extended his interest in financial services to other companies like American Express and GEICO, which combined the best of consumer product companies—brand identity—with the raw scale economies of large financial institutions. Given this, it’s no wonder Buffett came to land on the medieval term “moat” to describe competitive advantage. Buffett learned early on in Value 2.0 that companies with a solid, entrenched competitive position won, and kept winning—slowly but surely, year by year. Likewise, he learned to favor smart, cautious executives who deepened their moat but didn’t try to expand into new territory. Eisenhower, pushing the U.S. Army slowly but surely toward Germany in 1944, was the right archetype for Buffett. Napoleons made for good copy but almost always overreached. In the late 20th century, investing with this template proved extremely lucrative. Markets rewarded plodders and punished risk takers and innovators. When in 1985 Coca-Cola announced it was changing its formula to “New Coke,” its customers were so angry that Coke went back to the same mixture John Pemberton had come up with in 1886. As one of the three major national television networks, all ABC had to do was produce reasonably good programming to keep its hold on millions of American eyeballs. My favorite example of all is that of Scotch Tape, which was invented during the Depression by an engineer at 3M named Richard Drew. Despite its enormous mass-market appeal, no competitor tried to improve upon Scotch Tape for more than a generation after its introduction. Scotch Tape thus had the profitable niche of consumer adhesive to itself for thirty years. Can you imagine a company today maintaining its lead for thirty months, let alone thirty years, absent any innovation? As for investment in technology, Wall Street regarded it for much of the 20th century as a kind of social utility: It was wonderful for civilization, but it was terrible for stockholders. All too often, research and development spending in semiconductors and related technologies was deemed speculative or, just as bad, easily copied and therefore moatless. As a result, even into the late 1980s, good Value 2.0 investors like Peter Lynch dismissed tech stocks as a reliable way to make money. “For every single product in a hot industry,” Lynch wrote in One Up on Wall Street, “there are a thousand MIT graduates trying to figure out how to make it cheaper in Taiwan.” Then, sometime around the turn of the millennium, the world began to change. Ironically, the tipping point came right after the dot.com crash, which was the ultimate proof point to “good investors” that investing in tech stocks always ended poorly. What these investors failed to account for was the ineluctable power of Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law is as simple as it is profound: It stipulates that roughly every two years, computing power becomes twice as powerful with minimal incremental cost. Moore’s Law guaranteed that by the year 2000, computing power had become 30 million times more powerful than when semiconductors were commercialized in the 1950s. Thirty million times is a lot, but it wasn’t enough to generate the critical mass of a digital ecosystem. In 2000, for example, only 1% of the world’s population could access broadband internet, and only 15% could afford a cellphone. This goes a long way to explaining the dot.com crash—there simply wasn’t enough computing power to support the connected world we see around us today. However, Moore’s Law didn’t stop during or after the dot.com crash. Computing power became 30 million times more powerful between 2000 and 2002, then 60 million times more powerful between 2002 and 2004, and so on until sometime around 2010, it became strong enough to enable the technology-rich environment we now inhabit. Today, well more than half of the world’s population has both broadband access and a powerful smartphone. Today, much of the world searches, shops, chats, banks, and performs many other everyday activities online. Because consumers tend to standardize on a single application—Facebook for social media, Microsoft for office tools, Google for search—you also have tech companies that possess the customer loyalty and predictability that Buffett rightly craved. Suddenly, entire economic sectors became existentially threatened by digitally driven alternatives, and these threats extended to most of the hunting grounds that Buffett and Munger had for so long favored. Mass media, already disrupted by the advent of cable television, became even more fragmented as Google, YouTube, and Facebook usurped television’s dominion. In a fragmented media landscape, powerful brands like Coke and Budweiser could no longer press their advantage; it’s easy now to launch a niche brand using TikTok and Instagram. One of banks’ central pillars, its network of brick-and-mortar branches, is increasingly less relevant in a world that does much of its business digitally. Buffett and Munger found it hard to adjust to such changes—and at their age, who wouldn’t? Buffett was 73 when Google IPO’d. It’s difficult to fault him for not quite tuning in to the new narrative. On the other hand, at times Buffett demonstrated an almost willful resistance to the changes brought on by the digital age. He never learned how to use email, for example, and he gave up his flip phone for a smartphone only in 2020, thirteen years after the advent of the iPhone and four years after he invested in Apple. Exquisitely comfortable in the late 20th century ecosystem, he loved reading physical newspapers every morning and talking on the telephone from his office in the Midwest. Every year, he’d take the stage in Omaha for his annual meeting and drink his Cherry Cokes and eat his Dilly Bars. Munger would make a wisecrack, break off a chunk of See’s peanut brittle, and it was all good—until it wasn’t. Still, Buffett was too brilliant a business analyst not to grasp what was happening. He and Munger saw how digital businesses like Google were radically better businesses than even his best Value 2.0 investments. Coke sold sugar water, which had big margins, but to get to market Coke had to build bottling plants and establish a network of trucks and vending machines. When a software company wants to enter a new geographic market, its engineers simply write new code, hit “deploy,” and voila—the product is available around the globe, instantaneously and with almost no incremental costs. The result has been the rise of the most successful companies ever produced. Even though Coke was incorporated in 1892 and Alphabet was incorporated more than a century later, Alphabet now makes more than $100 billion in annual profit—nearly ten times more than Coca-Cola. In what amounted to an extemporaneous master class on the power of digital economics, Buffett acknowledged this superiority at his 2017 meeting. “This is a very different world than when Andrew Carnegie was building a steel mill and then using the earnings to build another steel mill and getting very rich in the process, or Rockefeller was building refineries and buying tank cars and everything,” Buffett told the crowd. “I don’t think people quite appreciate the difference. “Our capitalist system was built on tangible assets, but this asset-light model is so much better,” he continued. “Andrew Mellon would be absolutely baffled by looking at the high-cap companies now. I mean, the idea that you could create hundreds of billions of value, essentially without assets…” “Fast,” Munger interjected. “Fast, yeah,” Buffett agreed. “You literally don’t need any money to run the five tech companies that are worth collectively more than $2.5 trillion in the stock market, who have outpaced any number of those names that were familiar, if you looked at the Fortune 500 list 30 or 40 years ago, you know, whether it was Exxon or General Motors, or you name it.” This is all standard, brilliant Buffett stuff—but why, aside from Apple, did he never pull the trigger on these stocks? Over the last twenty years he has been consistently underweight technology stocks, and he forewent hundreds of billions of dollars of value creation in doing so. Having evolved so well from Value 1.0 to 2.0, why did he fail to evolve to Value 3.0? And if he had, would it have made his record better? The second question is easier to settle than the first. The answer to it is unquestionably yes—Berkshire Hathaway’s stock performance would have been materially better had he followed through on his observations about the superiority of tech’s business models and invested in more of them. When Buffett started buying Apple nearly a decade ago, if he had deployed excess cash (the cash he didn’t need for potential insurance claims) into each of the three mega-tech stocks besides Apple that he knew best—Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft—I estimate that Berkshire Hathaway’s market cap would not be the $1 trillion it is now, but at least $1.6 trillion. It’s important to note that this calculation incorporates only the market appreciation of these three stocks. If the market had capitalized Buffett’s “getting tech” and given Berkshire Hathaway’s stock a greater premium as a result, then Berkshire’s gain would have been greater. (Berkshire did buy $6.5 billion worth of Alphabet’s stock earlier this year, though it’s not clear whether it was Buffett or his lieutenants who pulled the trigger on the purchase). While rough, my estimates are not crazy. Buffett understood all three stocks well. He was close friends with Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, who explained the company’s competitive advantages to Buffett many times. At his 2017 annual meeting, Buffett admitted that he “blew it” by not investing in Amazon and Alphabet. Investing a big slug of his cash in these liquid, mega-cap stocks would have solved the “problem of large numbers” that some who seek to rationalize Buffett’s average latter-day record point to. And my estimate assumes that Buffett bought only a single slug of each. To those who say, “Buffett didn’t miss tech—he had Apple,” I would say two things. First, thank goodness Buffett invested in Apple—can you imagine what his recent record would look like if he hadn’t? Second, I would argue that by the time he invested in Apple the company was acting more like one of his mature, moated consumer products companies than it was a company we would recognize as a “tech company:” ambitious and forward-looking in its investment and R&D spending. When Buffett first bought Apple shares in 2016, it had transformed into a business that had much more in common with Coke and Gillette than it did Amazon or Alphabet. People forget that two important things happened in the years immediately before Berkshire began to buy Apple. First, Steve Jobs became terminally ill and was replaced in 2011 by Tim Cook. Suddenly, the design visionary was out, and the man whose main achievement was perfecting the company’s supply chain was in. While Jobs brought us the iPod and the iPhone, he also was responsible for the Lisa and the Newton, and he once almost bought Universal Music, a purchase that would have meant handing over cash or stock worth nearly Apple’s entire market capitalization at the time. That wasn’t going to happen under Cook. The quartermaster had replaced the field marshal. Salieri replaced Mozart, and this suited Buffett fine. Then, two years after the management change, Carl Icahn launched a proxy fight to force Apple to stop accumulating cash and start returning it to shareholders via massive share buybacks. Icahn never said it exactly like this, but the subtext was clear: With the genius gone and the iPhone bringing in billions, it was time to act like a mature consumer products company. Cook had already begun buying back stock, but Icahn wanted him to do much more, and Cook eventually obliged. By 2015, Cook was saying things like, “By and large, my view is for cash that we don’t need, with some level of buffer, we want to give it back. We’re not hoarders.” The next year, Buffett started buying shares. Post-Jobs, Apple was exactly the kind of company Buffett understood and loved. It had a moat, it worked hard to expand that moat, but beyond that it wasn’t terribly ambitious. A technocrat, not an innovator, was in charge. You can easily see this in not only the tone of Cook’s remarks but in his actions. What is Apple’s biggest innovation since Jobs died in 2011? The Apple Watch and—it’s almost sad to say it—AirPods? As you can see from the accompanying chart, Apple ranks near the bottom of the Magnificent Seven in terms of research and development spending as a percentage of sales. Alphabet and Amazon spend nearly twice as much, and Meta spends three times more. It’s hard to argue that Cook’s plan hasn’t worked. The stock has risen more than tenfold since Buffett began buying it, and Apple remains the second-most-valuable company in the world. But Microsoft is up eight-and-a-half times since Buffett began buying Apple; Amazon is up nearly sevenfold; and Alphabet has octupled. All have dramatically outperformed the market, and Buffett had plenty of evidence almost a decade ago that they would. He understood their competitive advantages ago; he admitted he blew it by not buying them; but he didn’t. Why? Because like other good late 20th century investors, Buffett learned that reinvestment, especially in technology, leads to heartbreak rather than value creation. In his era, companies that reinvested often destroyed value rather than created it. But that is not the era we live in today. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and hundreds of other smaller and lesser-known companies all reinvest a double-digit percentage of their revenues in research and development. The superiority of digital business models permits them to. Without a cost of goods sold—zeros and ones are metaphysical rather than physical—what an average tech company spends on R&D exceeds the entire profit margin of the average American corporation by 50%. Today, unlike a generation ago, there’s abundant evidence that companies which invest in the future will and should be rewarded. Amazon’s average P/E multiple has averaged more than 200x since it went public, but the stock continues to appreciate. Why? Because investors continue to believe that Amazon is depressing current profits to maximize future ones. It’s a “jam tomorrow” company rather than a “jam today” one. Apple is more jam today. It continues to return capital, which is fine, but you don’t get something for nothing. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have plowed billions of profits into new industries like cloud computing, driverless cars, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence; Apple is not a major player in any of these mega-trends. The iPhone accounts for most Apple’s profits. What happens if geopolitical friction impairs the company’s smartphone supply chain, which is still heavily dependent on China? And what happens to Apple if worldwide demand for the iPhone falters, which it perhaps already has? Economic nationalism has begun to cause the Chinese to turn to domestic devices, and China accounts for 20% of the company’s sales. If the courts rule that Google can no longer pay Apple to be its default search engine, almost a quarter of Apple’s profit evaporates. These vulnerabilities illustrate the wisdom of Elon Musk’s 2018 dictum that “moats are lame. If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation.” The wonderful thing about the early 21st century is that, unlike Buffett, we don’t have to choose between mature, moated companies on the one hand and high growth but speculative ones on the other. Today, in a Value 3.0 world, we can have moats and brands and high growth as well. Despite its enormous size, big tech continues to grow its topline at multiples of the growth rate of the American economy. Amazon has been in business for more than a generation but it still has only a single-digit domestic market share of both retail sales and computing operations. The company’s market cap is so large that we tend to forget such statistics, but like age, market cap turns out to be just a number. The investment landscape changed once after World War II, when American business was stable and slowly growing and Buffett could invest with confidence in dominant, moated enterprises. It has now changed again with the advent of huge, winner-take-most digital platform companies—not just the mega-tech companies, but dozens of others like Intuit and Adobe, ARM and Atlassian, Uber and Airbnb. All these companies dominate their niche as much as Coke and Bud did in their day. Because the economy has changed, as value investors we must change with it. Part of this recalibration needs to be quantitative. We need to adjust our metrics to account for companies like Amazon, who spend on the future through the income statement. Such spending penalizes current earnings and makes its stock appear more expensive, but, as GEICO did when Buffett bought the company 30 years ago, the spending boosts future earnings. There’s another, broader recalibration we must also undertake. Just as Munger told Buffett when they were young men, Value 1.0 was useful in its time but, as business and markets evolved, it ignored certain relevant facts. With its emphasis on milking a business rather than reinvesting in it, isn’t it time to say the same regarding Value 2.0? In the end, whether Buffett “missed tech” or not is irrelevant. He has now all but removed himself from the great arena of the stock market, and the best requiem we can give him is to ask how we should proceed ourselves. The only thing more pitiful than hearing about “the next Warren Buffett” is hearing his disciples parroting Buffetisms as if were still 1967, 1987, or even 1997. Many of these disciples have failed to apply the maestro’s maxims to the present day’s radically altered business landscape. “My favorite holding period is forever,” Buffett has said, and it’s a good axiom—but should we be holding businesses like Coke and Wells Fargo, whose best days are likely behind them, or ones like Alphabet and Microsoft? “Price is what you pay, value is what you get,” Buffett has said, and that’s also true—but what does the saying mean in the context of a tech company’s ambitious spending and consequently high P/E ratio? Conversely, what does it mean for a business like Kraft Heinz, a Buffett holding that has systematically failed to reinvest and has thus systematically eroded its business value? Kraft Heinz has so thoroughly failed, in fact, that it’s resorting to the ultimate refuge of corporate scoundrels: a breakup. When I go to Berkshire meetings these days or am around value investors generally, I hear these axioms endlessly repeated, but with little thought to their contemporary meaning. It’s like members of an old, established religion mumbling a catechism without thinking about its relevance to their world today. Buffett and Munger never meant their wisdom to be suspended in amber. They were far more flexible and sophisticated thinkers than that. Value investors need to be, too. Fortunately, as the 21st century enters its second generation, more and more value investors are adapting their templates to a Value 3.0 world. For every holdout like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who continues to rail against tech’s high valuations while owning coal miners and annuity companies, there are investors like Tom Gayner at Markel, Bill Nygren at Oakmark, and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital. They have all used a value-based discipline to make successful investments in tech. My favorite is Lew Sanders, the former CEO of Value 1.0 paragon Sanford Bernstein. During the Great Financial Crisis, Sanders bought banks because they looked cheap using traditional value metrics. Many were in fact worthless, and Bernstein fired him. Forced to start over with his own firm, Sanders decided that the world had changed. He changed with it: His top positions now include Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Taiwan Semiconductor.

Title: In 2025, bitcoin showed how spectacularly wrong price forecasts can be

2025 is drawing to an end with few crypto market stories more dramatic than the Oct. 10 “flash crash," when bitcoin BTC$88,084.21 plunged $12,000, or nearly 10%, in minutes. The meltdown triggered more than $19 billion in liquidations in just 24 hours, followed by a trader-circulated “cascade warning” and a staggering $500 billion wiped from total crypto market capitalization. That set the scene for an extended slide that's seen the largest cryptocurrency drop to more than 30% below the peak $126,223 value it set just six days earlier. This painful drop is likely to leave it posting the first full-year loss since the crypto winter of 2022. The year began on a more optimistic note, with bitcoin price predictions ranging from dream-like fantasies to more conservative targets that, at times, seemed within reach. Then it all changed after the Oct. 10 crash. Many predictions, from seasoned analysts to outspoken evangelists, shared one thing in common: They didn’t age well. Let's leave aside the long-term forecasts that soared as high as $1 billion by 2038 from Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity's global head of macro, or the undated $700,000 if institutional adoption reached scale from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Even the more restrained estimates now seem somewhat overblown. Some forecasts weren’t just bullish; they were explosive. Samson Mow, CEO of bitcoin technology company Jan3, predicted in February that bitcoin would reach $1 million by the end of 2025 in a “violent” upward move fueled by the collapse of fiat currencies. He received support from Blockstream CEO and founder Adam Back, arguably one of the most respected personalities in bitcoin, who, in April, also reportedly said he believed BTC could reach $500,000 to $1 million by end-2025. His bullish thesis was driven by ETF inflows, institutional buying and limited supply. He wasn't the only one. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya also forecast $500,000 by October. Even some of the more conservative estimates for the year-end price target surpassed the all-time high. Among them were JPMorgan analysts, who in early October, before the crash, raised their year-end forecast to $165,000, basing it on a growing embrace of the "debasement trade," a rise in investor demand for alternative stores of value. Even after the crash, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), helped keep bulls' hopes alive with his Oct. 28 “expectation” that BTC would be “about $150,000 by the end of this year”. Strategy, the holder of the most bitcoin among publicly traded companies, bought another $1 billion of BTC on Dec. 15, increasing its total holdings to 671,268. Of course, they weren’t alone. Throughout 2025, a flood of price predictions poured in from across the crypto landscape, most of which serve only as reminders of just how hard forecasting can be. There was the forecast for a first-quarter peak of $180,000 from VanEck’s digital asset research team, more than $50,000 above the actual high. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had said BTC would reach $200,000 in 2025, backed by what he called “the most bullish setup in years.” Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors repeated his $200,000–$250,000 forecast well into October. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said he was “sticking with” a similar range as late as November. Only a handful adjusted their expectations downward in time. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, once a $500,000 prophet, was one of the few to publicly dial it back, saying in October that BTC would likely end the year between $120,000 and $125,000. Standard Chartered followed suit in December, slashing its target to $100,000 from $200,000. In the end, 2025 reminded the market of an old truth: Bitcoin humbles everyone. It shrugs off models, breaks charts, and ignores even the boldest calls. Some missed by inches. Others missed by miles. But nearly all missed. As the dust settles, the industry is once again left with charts to redraw, narratives to rewrite, and a single, undeniable takeaway: in crypto, predictions are easy to make. Being right is rare.

Title: AI boom to supercharge European banks' rally
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1230/1550903-ai-boom-to-supercharge-european-banks-rally/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T11:05:38Z
Full Content:
After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence. As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a new force drawing investors to European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets. Banks have started to use AI to improve operational efficiency and fraud detection, as well as to reduce staff costs. "European banks could be a real beneficiary of AI," said Helen Jewell, chief investment officer for fundamental equities at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with about $12 trillion under management. "A lot of the AI story has been focused on the revenue winners, but we also know that when it comes to AI, there is a beneficiary from the cost winners," she said at a press event. UBS said in a note to investors they see AI as a key source of potential upside to banks' near-term valuations and longer- term earnings. But that comes with risks. Warnings over AI-related exuberance and the risks of a dot-com style bust have come from various sides, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. And risks are not only AI-related. The ECB said euro zone banks face "unprecedentedly high" risk of shocks including geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies, climate-related crises and even a dollar squeeze for banks exposed to the volatile US currency. Yet investors have snapped up bank stocks in earnest. Societe Generale shares have rallied 140% this year, Commerzbank 125% and those in Barclays rose almost 70%. An index of European bank stocks is up more than 60%, on top of the 25% gain in 2024 and more than four times better than the pan European index. Investors also view them as relatively cheap, particularly when compared with US banking shares. European bank stocks currently trade around 1.17 times their price-to-book value, some 40% below their 2007 peak and below the 1.7 times of their US rivals, according to LSEG data. In terms of costs, Goldman Sachs said in a note that costs would grow at a compound annual rate of only 1% between 2025 and 2027. The US bank also sees efficiency continuing well into 2026, with banks' cost/income ratios improving by 130 basis points year on year, meaning companies are expected to spend less to generate income. Consulting firm McKinsey estimated last year that AI could bring the global banking industry as much as $340 billion a year in additional value, with a drop in operational costs of 20%. Even if AI implementation savings take years to fully emerge, it will be a big enough shift to drive greater expansion in valuations, UBS said. Last month, analysts raised their net revisions for the sector by the most since May 2023, and 12-month forward earnings growth expectations jumped to the highest since 2023, according to IBES data. Growth in bank lending to euro zone firms is still running near its highest since mid-2023, according to the most recent ECB data. Credit growth to businesses was unchanged at 2.9% in October - just below August's 3%, the most since May 2023 - compared to the previous month, while loan growth to households accelerated to a two and a half year high of 2.8% from 2.6%. BlackRock's Jewell expects European banks to return 20-25% of market value to shareholders over the next three years via dividends and share buybacks. "If you put together valuation and the shareholder remuneration, you still have an asset class that is quite attractive," Equita co-head of research Domenico Ghilotti said, adding that merger activity is another driver underpinning the sector. The takeover of Mediobanca by state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena was one of the biggest in the sector this year, transforming Italian banking. Other deals could be on the way. "What we are seeing is economic resilience within Europe, and that means that even if we do see more rate cuts, that economic resilience will be good for European banks," BlackRock's Jewell said.

Title: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Today? BlackRock’s BTC Moves Shakes Market

BlackRock has transferred a significant amount of BTC to the crypto exchange Coinbase, sparking concerns about a sell-off. This comes as the Bitcoin price continues to struggle to break above $90,000 successfully. Arkham data shows that Blackrock deposited 2,201 BTC ($192.13 million) into Coinbase, putting the Bitcoin price at risk of further decline amid increasing selling pressure. The move followed the outflow recorded by BlackRock’s BTC ETF on December 26, with Bitcoin funds as a group seeing a net outflow of $275.88 million. These Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a seven-day outflow streak, which also prompted BlackRock to deposit 6,174.39 BTC last week, likely to offload these coins and redeem shares of its BTC fund. The Bitcoin price has struggled to break above $90,000 amid these outflows from the BTC funds. Notably, the Bitcoin price had broken above $90,000 on December 28 but quickly lost those gains yesterday as BlackRock moved the coins to Coinbase. Crypto pundit Martini claimed that BlackRock wasn’t the only one putting significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. He alleged that Binance, Wintermute, Coinbase, and Fidelity also sold a significant amount of BTC, collectively dumping $3.5 billion yesterday. Crypto pundit Bull Theory claimed that there was a weekend manipulation as the Bitcoin price pumped $3,000 and broke $90,000, liquidating $103 million worth of shorts this Sunday. He then noted that on Monday morning, BTC dumped $2,700 and liquidated $40 million worth of longs, erasing its entire pump in the process. With the current price action, BTC is heading for a red yearly close, as it is currently down over 6% year-to-date (YTD). In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that most of the data continues to become more favorable for the Bitcoin price, putting in a bottom against the equity markets and gold in the coming weeks. He added that the data also points to the flagship crypto outperforming these assets. The analyst stated that this was based on just factual data and not emotions. The Bitcoin price had notably outperformed these major assets at the start of the year but has since fallen behind, following the October 10 crypto crash. Gold is up 66% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 17% since the start of the year. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows also predicted that BTC could soon rally, noting that the long-term holders have stopped selling for the first time since July 2025. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,300, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Bitcoin’s $90K rejection: Is BTC's digital gold narrative losing to bonds?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-90k-rejection-is-btc-digital-gold-narrative-losing-to-bonds
Time Published: 2025-12-30T10:40:43Z

Bitcoin's recovery relied on a shift toward the "digital gold" narrative, but global growth risks and strong equity markets have delayed that breakout. Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Bitcoin failed to break $90,000 again as investors favored gold and bonds. S&P 500 record highs and lower interest rates have reduced Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge compared to traditional equities. Bitcoin (BTC) faced strong rejection near $90,000 on Monday, triggering nearly $100 million in liquidations across leveraged positions. Strong demand for traditional hedges such as gold and US government bonds led traders to question whether Bitcoin has the momentum needed to reclaim the $100,000 level. Gold prices held above $4,300 on Monday, while yields on the two-year US Treasury fell to their lowest level since August 2022. Rising demand for government-backed assets signals broader risk aversion, particularly as the US fiscal deficit is expected to widen in 2026. The US Treasury also faces the difficult task of rolling over roughly $10 trillion in debt throughout the year. Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer of the Rockefeller Global Family Office, told Reuters: Meanwhile, the negative impact of US import tariffs on economic growth has been offset by massive spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure, according to Yahoo Finance. Investor sentiment has deteriorated since the US Department of Labor reported the November US unemployment rate at 4.6%, the highest level in four years. Under normal circumstances, such data would lead traders to raise expectations for a more aggressive stimulus stance from the US Federal Reserve. But this time, inflation risks have become a significant constraint. Even so, the S&P 500 surged to a new all-time high in December, adding to discomfort among Bitcoin investors. If the Fed continues to trim interest rates, equities tend to move higher due to the direct impact on corporate balance sheets. Lower capital costs support higher valuations, while consumer credit conditions also improve. As a result, Bitcoin’s appeal as an independent hedge becomes less compelling. Bitcoin’s difficulty in holding the $90,000 level reflects traders’ risk perceptions, as the cryptocurrency has yet to establish itself as a reliable store of value amid a global recession. If investments in artificial intelligence deliver the expected returns, major tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT US), Nvidia (NVDA US) and Google (GOOG) could unlock additional valuation upside, potentially pushing equity markets to new all-time highs. Bitcoin mining has also moved into focus amid rising energy costs. Investors worry that miners are operating at extremely low, or even negative, margins. Tighter operating cash flows have pushed miners to rely more frequently on debt and equity-linked financing to maintain liquidity, including secondary share offerings. Meanwhile, the network hash rate has edged lower after peaking in late October. However, VanEck analysts argue that Bitcoin miner capitulation is “historically a bullish contrarian signal.” A report by VanEck crypto research lead Matt Sigel noted that Bitcoin’s 90-day forward returns have historically been positive 65% of the time following 30-day periods of network hashrate decline. The report attributed the recent drop in hash rate to the shutdown of 1.3 gigawatts of mining capacity in China. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Another factor behind investors’ reluctance to add exposure near the $87,000 level is the compression in valuation multiples among digital reserve asset companies. There is little incentive to issue shares below the market value of their underlying Bitcoin holdings. For example, Strategy (MSTR US) traded at a 16% discount, while Twenty One Capital (XXI US) was valued 18% below its reserves, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on a shift in risk perception that favors the digital gold narrative. This process may take longer as attention remains focused on global economic growth risks.

Title: LIZ PEEK: Five unforgettable lessons we all learned in 2025, but some Democrats still didn’t

The 'Outnumbered' panel discusses DEI's impact on job markets and Vice President JD Vance's criticisms at AmericaFest2025. Americans — celebrate 2025! The year we found out that Democrats have been wrong about nearly everything and that common-sense Americans were right all along. Think that’s an exaggeration? Consider: Climate alarmism is dead. It turns out we need oil and gas; LET'S TEACH OUR KIDS WHY AMERICA IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR Kids march against climate change in New York. (Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Perhaps the most consequential change of 2025 was the long-overdue realization that climate alarmism is possibly more dangerous than climate change. When even billionaire Bill Gates, long-time climate crusader, hangs up his spikes, something profound has shifted. Gates recently wrote a memo admitting climate change "will not lead to humanity’s demise;" the welcome dose of realism from one of the world’s richest human beings comes only a year after he penned a book entitled "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster." Look how blue state officials are running pell-mell away from climate mandates that have driven electricity costs higher and infuriated voters. Exhibit one is New York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, who recently lifted the damaging de facto ban on natural gas pipeline construction imposed by her predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. DEFINING FAIR PLAY: WHY SWING-STATE DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF STEP ON PROTECTING WOMEN’S SPORTS After clinging to Cuomo’s disastrous climate agenda for years and watching New York’s electricity rates soar to 40% above the national average, Hochul approved key permits for the Williams Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) natural gas pipeline in November, infuriating climate warriors. Hochul said energy needs and grid reliability dictated the change. For a woman who wants to outlaw gas stoves, it was quite an about-face. National Guard members patrol in Washington, Nov. 27, 2025. (Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Both Gates and Hochul are in step with the corporate community, which has quietly abandoned environmental goals, as the need for power to fuel AI data banks reigns supreme. The reality is that trillions of dollars of investment in renewable fuels has barely reduced demand for oil, gas and coal. Also, the cost to western nations of suffocating their economies to reduce carbon emissions has become too high, especially since China, India and other developing nations are today’s biggest emitters and abide by no such regulations. As Gates wrote, the emphasis needs to be on improving lives – both here and around the world – not blindly trying to curb fossil fuels. HIGH-RANKING DEMOCRATS ADMIT TO KNOWINGLY ABANDONING WOMEN Under President Joe Biden, Democrats spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily, boosting our deficits relative to the economy to levels never before seen except during major wars. The gusher of cash not only fed decades-high inflation, it also opened the door to mammoth fraud, with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars going missing. More recently, the nation has discovered a still-developing scandal where the Somali community in Minnesota allegedly stole as much as $9 billion in funds meant to feed hungry children and house the homeless. CONSERVATIVE GROUPS DECLARE 2025 A TIPPING POINT ON ‘CLIMATE HYSTERIA’ AS TRUMP UNLEASHES ENERGY AGENDA Democrats (and sometimes Republicans) hope to attract voters by doling out money; they know that if citizens become dependent on lavish handouts, they will vote to keep the good times rolling. But someone has to pay for free stuff; that poor sod is the taxpayer, who eventually rebels. As blue states jack taxes higher to feed their welfare machines, they bleed businesses and residents who flee to lower-tax locales like Florida and Texas. Bottom line, Big Government does not work. Never has, never will. Early on, President Donald Trump reversed what he called the "illegal and immoral" DEI programs that Biden had required be implemented in every corner of the federal government. Biden’s executive order, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government" demanded nearly every federal agency — including air traffic control and the military — submit "Equity Action Plans," which led to "immense public waste and shameful discrimination." Inspired by the president’s pushback against the virtue-signaling programs, corporations, aware that such efforts divide their employees and stoke resentment, quietly let DEI fall by the wayside. Under President Joe Biden, Democrats spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily, boosting our deficits relative to the economy to levels never before seen except during major wars. In February, Accenture’s CEO wrote a memo to staff indicating the huge professional services firm was shelving its DEI program since it had "largely achieved its goals" and "we are and always have been a meritocracy." Dozens of companies, including Pepsico, Disney, Blackrock, McDonald's, Ford, Walmart and others, followed suit. In 2016, Harvard Business School published a report on "Why Diversity Programs Fail", revealing that decades of mandated diversity efforts had made little progress because, studies showed, "force-feeding can activate bias rather than stamp it out." That remains the case today. You would think it obvious that putting more cops on the beat brings down crime. But leftists in the U.S. insist, based on ideology rather than common sense or evidence, that law enforcement is the problem and not the cure. THE FAR LEFT HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM, AND IT’S TURNING VOTERS OFF Trump deployed the National Guard to the streets of D.C., and they became safer. Hochul activated the National Guard to protect New York’s subways, and, not surprisingly, they became less dangerous. This is not rocket science. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Allowing young people to permanently change their gender is an atrocity that has blessedly been outlawed in much of Europe and is now restricted in 27 states. Because there remains a group in the U.S. weirdly dedicated to promoting this heinous activity, activists continue to push for its legality. They are suing to overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling in United States v. Skrmetti that a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care did not constitute sex-based discrimination and did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The left is adamant that underage kids, often without the knowledge of their parents, should be able to mutilate their own bodies and permanently destroy their reproductive capabilities. It is hard to imagine a crueler campaign. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Happily, common sense prevailed on these five issues during 2025.

Title: These 8 big deals defined the year in artificial intelligence
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-ai-deals-acquisitions-of-the-year-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-30T10:00:02Z

While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, deal teams were grinding at Meta, Nvidia, and SoftBank. They chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: Meta said Tuesday that it's buying Manus, an artificial intelligence agent that went viral earlier this year. Also this week, SoftBank said it would acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion. Nvidia made a splash on Christmas Eve, announcing a "non-exclusive licensing agreement" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies didn't disclose financial terms. While Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently. It's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo. That's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines. The industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond. These were the nine deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value. Nvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out. On Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed. Under the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion. Groq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role. Disney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator. The deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together. Business Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow. The OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters. With days left on the calendar, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta squeezed in an acquisition of Manus, the buzzy startup working on autonomous agents. The hefty price tag — more than $2 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal and other outlets — underscores Meta's strategy. Meta is using its cash to buy speed and to recruit the people who can help it keep up with the labs setting the agenda. The acquisition will enable Meta to provide advanced technology to its users "with safeguards in place to eliminate areas of potential risk," Meta told Business Insider in a statement. Manus was founded in China and relocated to Singapore in 2025. Meta said it would cut Manus' ties to China after acquiring the startup. Congress has imposed restrictions on US investments in Chinese technology firms, citing national security concerns. Developer coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale. The company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute. Google emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property. The deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste. Part of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public. Now, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent. SoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI. On Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals. The deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on "physical AI," building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business. The Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it. Under the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat. The investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas. This also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund. One of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old? Alexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI. Wang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge. When Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist. In March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition. The acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing. Trump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029. In Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come. To make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce. Jump to

Title: Strategy stock bleeds as MSCI verdict nears – What next for MSTR?

MSCI delisting fears and stock dilution drags MSTR lower. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, saw its stock drop to a fresh yearly low. Following a broader tech sell-off on the 29th of December, MSTR stock dropped by 2.15% to a record 2025 low of $155.32. From its 2024 high of $543, MSTR has crashed by 71%, presenting several Wall Street bears with a windfall opportunity. Although some bears began unwinding short positions in November to realize their gains, MSTR’s free fall did not slow down. At press time, the stock was back within the 2024 price range of $100-$180. Source: MSTR, TradingView One of the factors driving bearish sentiment over the past few weeks has been the risk of MSCI index delisting MSTR and other crypto treasury firms. Although the Strategy founder, Michael Saylor, has defended the firm as an operational company that should remain on the global index, prediction site Polymarket was pricing a +75% chance of delisting in early 2026. JPMorgan analysts warned that such a move would drive $8 billion in outflows from the stock. Some even speculated that the delisting would force liquidation of its Bitcoin holdings, but market expectations for such a BTC sell-off remained low. The MSCI decision in mid-January could offer the needed clarity for the stock’s next direction. Additionally, the ongoing dilution through MSTR stock sales to fund Bitcoin [BTC] purchases may have contributed to the stock’s pressure. According to analyst Novacula Occami, Strategy sold $4 billion worth of MSTR despite its BTC holdings trading below its enterprise value, or mNAV, being below 1. “Since that July announcement, they’ve issued $4.9 billion of $MSTR common with $4 billion of that issued at a common mNAV below 1 (in Nov and Dec).” Source: X The firm had earlier stated that it wouldn’t sell the common stock (MSTR) if the mNAV fell below 2.5x, then changed it to 1x. Overall, Strategy has spent $22.5 billion to buy Bitcoin in 2025. This was nearly half of its +$50 billion investment in BTC since 2020. Source: CryptoQuant This has been funded by MSTR and preferred stock sales, as well as debt. In fact, the latest $108 million BTC buy was wholly funded by MSTR stock sales. Strategy now owns 672,497 BTC. That said, despite the massive dump in 2025, Wall Street analysts were still bullish on MSTR stock. There were 13 buy ratings in the past month, with price targets ranging from $465 to $485, implying a 170%-200% upside potential.

Title: Bitwise CEO Points to Bitcoin Amid Iran’s Deepening Currency Crisis

Written & Edited byKamina Bashir Iran’s rial hit a record low against the US dollar, sparking protests on the streets across the capital and other major cities. This economic crisis has revived the debate over Bitcoin’s potential as a safe haven. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggested that the largest cryptocurrency could serve as a form of protection against financial turmoil. According to the Financial Times, the currency has lost over 40% of its value since Iran’s conflict with Israel in June 2025. Notably, the rial’s drop from 32,000 per dollar in 2015 to over 1.4 million represents a nearly 44-fold depreciation in ten years. This swift decline has intensified Iran’s economic crisis. “The official rate in the early 1980s was 70 per dollar,” Alex Gladstein stated. Inflation reached 42.2% in December, marking an increase from the same period last year and rising 1.8% compared with November. This has put Iranian families under severe strain. Food prices surged 72% in December 2025 compared to one year prior, while medical goods rose 50%. Shops in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar shut in protest, and demonstrations spread to Isfahan, Shiraz, and Mashhad. The Associated Press reported these were the largest street protests since 2022. The Iranian rial tumbled to 1.43–1.45 million per USD, plunging 7% amid fresh U.S. sanctions, soaring inflation, and scarce foreign inflows. Footage from Tehran’s bazaars shows shopkeepers closing stores in protest, chanting “Don’t be afraid, we are all together” and “Shut it… pic.twitter.com/ky0tqGY5zW The crisis is accelerated by falling oil revenue due to US sanctions, deep-seated issues in the banking sector, political chaos, and structural corruption. Amid this, the Central Bank Governor, Mohammad Reza Farzin, has resigned. Government efforts, such as food vouchers and subsidies, have aimed to ease public frustration. Yet, they offer limited relief amid persistent inflation. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens like gold have soared. Gold coins, a classic store of wealth in Iran, reached 1.7 billion rials each on December 28, more than double their value in June. While gold has long been established as a traditional safe-haven asset, many are also pointing to Bitcoin as a potential alternative. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley echoed this view in a recent post. “Economic mismanagement – The story of the past, present, and future. Bitcoin is a new way for the people to protect themselves,” Horsley stated. The concept of Bitcoin as a hedge is being increasingly applied across multiple economies. In the US, rising inflation and recession fears have led many investors to position Bitcoin as a tool to protect purchasing power. Previously, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also advocated for Bitcoin. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or… of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears,” Fink said. Worldwide data support the increased use of cryptocurrency to fight inflation. According to a September 2025 MEXC report, 46% of crypto users cited digital assets as a means to hedge against inflation. Argentina offers a clear example of this trend in practice. As the peso collapsed and inflation accelerated, Argentines increasingly turned to Bitcoin and stablecoins to preserve their value. While the collapse of Iran’s rial has reignited the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement, the reality is more nuanced. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and independence from domestic monetary policy make it an appealing alternative in environments marked by chronic inflation, capital controls, and political instability. In such contexts, it increasingly serves as a tool for preserving value when confidence in national currencies erodes. However, it is equally important to acknowledge that Bitcoin remains quite volatile. Furthermore, government bans and restrictions can also hinder access and usability.

Title: The Economic Warning Sign Hiding Behind White-Collar Layoffs

White-collar layoffs at firms like McKinsey and Amazon grab headlines for their implications about artificial intelligence and tariff pressures replacing plum jobs. But there’s another canary in the economic coal mine. What PYMNTS Intelligence calls the Labor Economy® — the roughly 60 million warehouse packers, delivery drivers, home health aides, construction workers, groundskeepers, janitors, retail associates and other blue-collar workers who keep America running — is also sending up warning signals.

Δ With the holiday shopping season in full swing, nearly half of United States Labor Economy workers say they have little to no confidence they can afford to buy presents without going into debt until next summer. Only 1 in 3 who hadn’t started shopping by Dec. 10 said they planned to buy anything at all, compared to 46% of other consumers. Those data points, a supplement to PYMNTS’ latest installment of the Wage to Wallet® Index, suggest pocketbook tightening across a broad swath of America that may indicate deeper trouble ahead. PYMNTS defines Labor Economy workers as people earning under $25 an hour, or less than $50,000 per year. Comprising about one-third the total U.S. workforce, they drive 15% of consumer spending, making them a significant economic bloc. When they dial back their spending, the broader economy takes a hit, creating ripple effects at the businesses their spending supports. Even small interruptions — think missed work shifts, reduced hours or a late direct deposit — can instantly stymie these workers’ ability to pay rent, buy groceries, make debt payments and pay for childcare. PYMNTS estimates that a 0.13% increase in wages for this group in November translated into roughly $2.2 billion in additional annualized spending capacity. This scant increase hardly offsets the 0.8% loss in wages in October, equivalent to an annualized $14 billion hit to GDP. That’s what makes PYMNTS’s fresh data about their holiday spending telling. The financial strain of Labor Economy workers is an early warning signs about pressures on broader economic health that may not show up in traditional metrics for months. Nearly 6 in 10 of Labor Economy workers are relying on cash or debit cards for their holiday purchases—meaning for them that if the money’s not in the account, nothing’s getting bought. Only 15% are using credit cards with the intention to pay in full at the end of the monthly billing cycle, compared to 31% of everyone else. And 4 in 10 plan to spend less this holiday season. Just 19% expect to spend more. And for many of those who do plan to shop, the financial pain won’t end come New Year’s day. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Of these consumers, 1 in 5 expect their holiday debt to take more than six months to repay, a financial ball and chain they will drag into summer 2025. The percentage is one-third higher than for non-labor economy workers, who predominantly have steadier paychecks and better access to low-interest credit. The irony is stark: The very workers powering everyone else’s year-end shopping — packing boxes, driving delivery trucks, restocking shelves, caring for families — are the ones most likely to skip it entirely or pay for it well into next year. It all reflects what PYMNTS calls a mirror economy. Somewhat but not entirely like the K-shaped economy of high earners doing well financially and middle-income and low-income ones struggling, the mirror economy reflects a “split” reality, in which economic sentiment “mirrors” the specific structural constraints a particular group operating in. Non-Labor optimism reflects an economy defined by expanding options and credit leverage , while Labor Economy pessimism mirrors a parallel reality defined by tightening constraints and personal liquidity pressure. In other words, different groups experience different economies, not one single economy in different ways. As such, the Labor Economy sentiment index reflects an economy that is no longer moving in a single direction but instead splitting along a fault line shaped by access to credit, timing of receipt and perceived opportunity. This suggests optimism in today’s economy is shaped less by overall employment levels and more by the mechanics of monthly and sometimes daily cash flow.

Title: 4 Ways 2025 Has Changed the Crypto Markets Forever
URL: https://beincrypto.com/2025-changed-crypto-markets-forever/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T08:00:00Z

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byHarsh Notariya The year 2025 has etched itself into the annals of financial history as the pivotal moment when crypto and digital assets transcended speculation and embedded themselves in the global economic fabric. From boardrooms on Wall Street to policy chambers in Washington, digital assets have evolved from fringe experiments to indispensable tools for wealth preservation and innovation. Institutional giants poured billions into Bitcoin, corporations built digital treasuries as hedges against inflation, meme coins danced on the razor’s edge of euphoria and oblivion, and a pro-crypto administration dismantled regulatory barriers with landmark legislation, such as the GENIUS Act. Drawing on extensive data and insights, this article examines how these forces converged to redefine markets. It explores how they attracted billions in new capital while exposing vulnerabilities in an ecosystem that is still finding its footing. As BeInCrypto has chronicled throughout the year, these transformations signal not just growth, but a fundamental realignment of power in the financial sector. The institutionalization of Bitcoin in 2025 marked a watershed moment for crypto, transforming the volatile asset into a cornerstone of diversified portfolios. Spot ETFs matured quickly, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF amassing nearly $68 billion in assets under management (AUM), dominating daily volumes and attracting the majority of inflows. Institutional AUM in Bitcoin surged to $235 billion, a 161% leap from 2024, fueled by pension funds overseeing $12 trillion in assets entering the fray for the first time. This AUM is achieved by measuring the sum of holdings between private companies, public companies, exchanges or custodians and ETFs, multiplied by the Bitcoin price. Projections from Bursera Capital indicated inflows exceeding $40 billion, surpassing the previous year’s record, as fair-value accounting rules mitigated balance sheet volatility. This allowed corporations to hold BTC without punitive mark-to-market losses. Regulatory clarity played a starring role, with the US establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and lifting restrictions on retirement plans. 2025 has clearly solved the access problem for institutions to allocate into Bitcoin.These were the five major structural obstacles that came down this year:▫️ Spot ETFs securitized Bitcoin▫️ Options markets formed around ETFs▫️ Prior regulatory restrictions in retirement… By mid-December, 14 of the top 25 US banks were developing Bitcoin products. This is according to Bitcoin financial services firm River. Meanwhile, asset managers maintained net long positions even during market dips. An EY survey conducted earlier in the year revealed that 86% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto holdings. DeFi exposure expected to triple from 24% to 75%. It emphasized yield generation through lending and derivatives on secure platforms, such as Fireblocks. Data on Newhedge shows Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dipped 70%, from a 2025 high of 3.81% to depths as low as 1.36% in August. This rendered it calmer than some traditional equities, while prices climbed from the $76,000 range to top out $126,000. Analysts at firms like Standard Chartered anticipated pension-driven demand shocks, where each $1 billion in ETF inflows could propel prices higher. According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, corporate Bitcoin holdings were under 600,000 BTC at the start of ,2025 but institutional interest has ramped up this year. Now, corporations hold over 4.7% of the total BTC supply. Against this backdrop, believers like Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy say Bitcoin is no longer fringe. Rather, it is financial infrastructure. This observation echoes the sentiment at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, where the US Vice President JD Vance’s BTC ownership and Pakistan’s national reserve were highlighted. Bitcoin 2025 Conference just changed the game 🟠📈US VP owns BTC.Pakistan launched a national Bitcoin reserve.Trump Media raised $2.5B to buy BTC.NYC Mayor wants Bitcoin-backed bonds.BlackRock’s ETF hit $71B AUM.Bitcoin is no longer fringe—it’s financial infrastructure.… pic.twitter.com/XhvdDnk2BF This institutional adoption went beyond stabilizing markets and positioned Bitcoin as a modeled reserve asset, forever altering portfolio strategies. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) experienced a surge in prominence in 2025. CoinGecko data shows they accumulated over $121 billion in assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This is while controlling substantial portions of their supplies, approximately 4% of ETH and 2.5% of SOL. Fair-value accounting catalyzed this surge, enabling corporations to allocate without balance sheet distortions; Bitwise analysts noted this could “tilt the market significantly.” MicroStrategy exemplified the trend, holding over 671,268 BTC, as corporate accumulations rose from 1.68 million to 1.98 million BTC mid-year. Data on Rwa.xyz shows that tokenized Treasuries increased by 80% to $8.84 billion, after reaching a peak of $9.3 billion in mid Q4. They outpaced stablecoins in terms of yield amid US rates of 3.50%–3.75%, leveraging blockchain technology for efficiency. Real-world assets (RWAs) excluding stablecoins grew 229% to $19 billion, with Ethereum anchoring $12.7 billion in Treasuries. Stablecoins exceeded $308 billion in market cap, according to data on DefiLlama, maturing under the GENIUS Act’s regulatory umbrella. Forecasts from Galaxy Research painted a bullish horizon, with DAO-managed bonds potentially exceeding $500 million by 2026, and crypto-backed loans reaching $90 billion. ETF inflows were projected to exceed $50 billion, with sovereign wealth funds expected to join the influx. However, headwinds emerged, with mNAV compression forcing some DATs to sell or shutter, as inflows plummeted 90-95% from July peaks amid scrutiny. BeInCrypto detailed how miners and firms navigated Bitcoin buying retreats, with DAT inflows hitting 2025 lows at $1.32 billion. A $25-$75 billion demand pivot into Treasuries via stablecoins highlighted integration with debt markets. “DATs can move beyond speculation and become lasting economic engines,” wrote analyst Ryan Watkins, highlighting their long-term implications. This rise bridged traditional finance and crypto, but with risks. Declining liquidity and fading confidence triggered sell-offs, pressuring firms like MicroStrategy and BitMine to innovate revenue models. Ultimately, DATs symbolized the fusion of resilience and ambition in 2025, reshaping corporate treasuries for the digital era. Meme coins in 2025 embodied the crypto market’s duality: a meteoric rise followed by a stark “heat death,” with trading volumes cratering 70-85% and mindshare plummeting 90%. memecoins hit their lowest mindshare in yearsfrom 20% → 2.5%0 next? pic.twitter.com/VpwaeklMhn The sector’s capitalization peaked above $100 billion in late 2024 but consolidated sharply. Yet, a late-year frenzy revived the narrative in September 2025. The total market cap approached $60 billion (2% of the crypto market). AI bots and centralized exchanges (CEXs) likely amplified the pumps, with the former known to exploit thin order books and arbitrage plays. OGs like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE retained multi-billion caps, growing into utility hybrids amid sector maturation. Pump.fun’s 90% volume drop signaled a pivot to utility alts, with a 2026 revival anticipated amid hype cycles. Memes captured 25% of investor interest, reimagined as “emotion futures.” CoinGecko dashboard highlights the market cap bottoming signals and the shift from hype to utility, with nearly 2 million tokens collapsing in Q1. This cycle’s meme coin mania, smarter and more dangerous with AI orchestration, reflects crypto’s speculative underbelly. Under President Donald Trump, dubbed the “Crypto President,” 2025 ushered in a regulatory renaissance. Among other things, it culminated in the signing of the GENIUS Act in July. This landmark law mandated 1:1 reserve, regular audits, consumer protections, and non-securities status for stablecoins, with oversight split between the OCC and states. Pre-passage odds reached 68%, with VP JD Vance pledging to implement tailored frameworks post-enactment. While the market structure bill stalled, leaving exchanges in limbo, GENIUS propelled the tokenization of assets forward. Concerns over Trump’s ventures fueled fears of rejection, but the passage signified a rules-first pivot. The FDIC geared up for implementation, authorizing banks for custody. Impacts included 20-30% growth in USDC and USDT adoption, alongside issuer consolidation. 6. One 6/18/2025 The GENIUS Act was passed by the Senate.

This regulatory thaw, from enforcement to empowerment, unlocked trillions in potential, cementing 2025 as the year crypto came of age. In retrospect, 2025 wasn’t just a banner year for crypto. It was the inflection point where digital assets claimed their stake in the future of money. With institutions leading the charge, treasuries fortifying balances, memes testing boundaries, and regulations providing guardrails, the markets emerged stronger, inclusive, and inevitable. As we gaze toward 2026, the lessons of this transformative epoch remind us: in crypto, evolution is survival.

Title: Ethereum TVL Set For Explosive Growth: Sharplink CEO Foresees Tenfold Surge In 2026
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-tvl-set-for-explosive-growth-sharplink-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T07:00:05Z
Full Content:
Joseph Chalom, the CEO of Sharplink, has outlined an optimistic forecast for Ethereum’s (ETH) future, emphasizing a significant increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the network in the coming year. According to a report from CoinMarketCap, Chalom anticipates that the stablecoin market will soar to $500 billion by December 2026. Currently, the total market capitalization for stablecoins stands at approximately $308.46 billion, suggesting a 62% growth from current figures. Given that Ethereum is responsible for processing over half of all stablecoin transactions across various blockchain networks, the projected expansion in stablecoin issuance and transaction volume is set to significantly elevate the network’s TVL. Chalom further predicts that the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will also witness substantial growth, potentially reaching a total value of $300 billion next year. This is expected to move beyond tokenizing individual securities and funds to encompass complete fund complexes, thereby increasing Ethereum’s relevance in the financial ecosystem. Key to this expected growth is the increasing involvement of major financial institutions from traditional finance such as BlackRock, which has shown heightened interest in blockchain technologies over the past year. Chalom predicts that it could serve as a catalyst for moving significant assets onto Ethereum’s infrastructure. The rise in total value locked usually indicates increased network utilization, which can bolster market sentiment and may influence Ethereum price dynamics. Currently, data shows ETH’s TVL at approximately $68.20 billion. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently expressed skepticism about Ethereum reaching new price highs in 2026, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s (BTC) market conditions. However, Chalom anticipates that sovereign wealth fund holdings and tokenization efforts on Ethereum could grow five- to tenfold in the coming year. This potential increase is attributed to competitive pressures that may encourage institutional investors, who have previously been hesitant about cryptocurrency exposure, to reconsider their strategies as peer adoption accelerates. Moreover, Chalom believes that the integration of on-chain artificial intelligence (AI) agents and prediction markets will gain mainstream traction in 2026, further driving activity and adding value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately, Sharplink’s CEO stressed that the convergence of institutional interest from traditional finance firms, expanded applications, and the involvement of sovereign funds could significantly position Ethereum for impressive TVL growth in the near future. Currently, Ethereum is trading at around $2,930, marking a 13% year-to-date decline for the leading altcoin. Compared to its all-time high of $4,964 reached earlier this year, the cryptocurrency is currently trading 40% below this level.

Each year, our most-read stories offer a snapshot of where the programmatic industry is at this moment. This year, programmatic companies faced tough decisions about privacy, awkward acquisitions and the cookie die-off that never quite happened. Programmatic is an industry that’s long past its youthful growth spurt and immaturity. Now it’s dealing with the discomfort of regulation and attention from lawmakers. While the programmatic web faced these tough decisions, connected TV felt the warm, golden glow of programmatic transformation. CTV represents an opportunity for programmatic natives and for streamers that haven’t fully embraced how data and automation can sweeten the revenue from their subscribers. Our top 10 stories highlighted programmatic growing pains, CTV’s evolution, how closely watched The Trade Desk continues to be and more. Here they are, starting at the top: 1. Google Is Found Guilty Of Operating An Ad Tech Monopoly (!) (April) Our top story of the year should come as no surprise to our readers. What happens to Google’s sell-side ads business affects everyone in the programmatic industry. The remedies to Google’s monopoly will have particular resonance among publishers and SSPs. The guilty verdict found that Google unlawfully tied its publisher ad server with its ad exchange, setting the stage for the remedies phase in the fall, when the judge decided what punishment to mete out to Google. 2. Microsoft Is Shutting Down Invest, The One-Time AppNexus DSP Business (May) Over the years, stories about AppNexus (later renamed Xandr, then Microsoft Invest) always ranked among the most popular AdExchanger stories – both because of its independent stance as a foil to Google and its attention-grabbing moves as a company. So it makes sense that the AppNexus DSP did not go quietly into the night. Industry leaders paid attention to what this shutdown means for the broader DSP and SSP space as well as Microsoft’s strategy. 3. The Trade Desk Is Acquiring Advertising Metadata Startup Sincera (January) The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk doesn’t make acquisitions. The Trade Desk …. made an acquisition. TTD reversed its historically un-acquisitive approach this year and bought Sincera, known for gathering advertising metadata to stamp out fraud and help advertisers improve their decision-making. In the months since, Sincera’s co-founder Mike O’Sullivan has become a public-facing decision-maker and representative for the DSP, and Sincera’s tech has woven itself into the Trade Desk’s seller strategy. 4. The Record CCPA Fine Against Healthline Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Publishers (July) The specter of CCPA enforcement has loomed over the programmatic industry for years. And Healthline’s fine, the first one to hit a publisher, offered a concrete example of what media companies have to worry about it. Tracking pixels and cookies on the health publisher’s site, a common addition to publishers’ sites, could telegraph a person’s health status. For publishers that have long gathered behavioral data about users based on the type of articles they read, this fine signaled the types of behaviors being tracked – as well as tracking, period – are no longer in compliance with the law. 5, The Trade Desk Promises Big Changes After Missing Its Q4 Guidance (February) The Trade Desk has long been a darling of Wall Street. But when it missed its Q4 guidance at the beginning of this year, investors started to worry not just about The Trade Desk but publicly traded ad tech companies. The earnings miss kicked off a year of change and challenges at The Trade Desk, as it sought to get back on track and push the industry on issues like transparency and labeling resellers. Even so, it ended the year with layoffs. 6. As CTV Blooms, It’s Knives Out For The Trade Desk’s Take Rate (April) The Trade Desk also faced more competition this year. Amazon’s DSP is breaking out beyond its endemic commerce advertisers. And like Google and YouTube, Amazon is paired up with Prime Video, the AVOD-by-default platform brimming with scale and inventory. But that’s not the only CTV DSP in the mix. With a rundown on the competitive landscape of CTV DSPs, this story underlined the challenge of bringing programmatic tech to CTV. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. 7. Meet The Netflix Ads Suite, Introduced By Ads VP Nicolle Pangis (March) After years of rumors, Netflix finally added an ad-supported subscription option. And the CTV industry wanted to know more. When Ads VP Nicolle Pangis appeared at CTV Connect this year, she revealed details about Netflix’s product road map and the product acronym, NAS, that will house the streamer’s ad tech ambitions. 8. Lawmakers Demand Answers From Ad Tech Vendors Allegedly Monetizing CSAM (February) The lack of transparency in ad tech has long meant advertisers buy ads in places where they don’t want them. But putting ads in illegal places, such as on CSAM, moves the conversation of “brand safety” into a different realm. When Adalytics discovered ads placed on illegal content earlier this year, lawmakers sent a letter to multiple ad tech companies demanding answers. 9. Google Isn’t Launching A User Choice Prompt For Third-Party Cookies In Chrome (April) For years, Google Chrome plotted a replacement to third-party cookies. Then it walked back that decision, validating the long-held industry skepticism around Google actually going through with that plan. Instead, Chrome was going to build its version of Apple ATT, the user choice prompt that asked users if they really, truly wanted cookies. Just kidding. Google wasn’t going to do that, either – a new story that was both a bombshell and the latest industry I-told-you-so. 10. The Ad Context Protocol Aims To Make Sense Of Agentic Ad Demand (October) How will ad tech change once agents enter the scene? It’s possible agents will negotiate campaign deals on behalf of clients. And AdCP, or Ad Context Protocol, is a new protocol that will standardize those interactions. The steady hum of traffic to this article post-publication speaks to the many minds figuring out the future of AI in digital ad transactions.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

Title: I was wrong about Elon. But he was wrong too

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. I was wrong, as it turns out, about Elon Musk. At least on this occasion. A year ago, I’d predicted that Musk would quit Tesla. It was a bold prediction but one backed with evidence: Sales of Tesla’s electric cars fell in 2025, the first annual decline in more than a decade, and for the billionaire to be juggling roles leading X, Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, the Boring Company and Neuralink seemed unsustainable. I thought that the incessant tweeting, the controversies and constant outrages, the demanding role in Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and a decline in vehicle sales would all collectively catch up to Musk. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board, with “Tesla’s stock sinking and some investors irritated Musk’s White House focus”, had gotten serious about looking for Musk’s successor. Credit: Bloomberg “After constant controversies and distractions, it will all come to a head in 2025, and Musk will be forced to hand over the reins at Tesla, a company many mistakenly think he founded,” I wrote. Musk hit back. “I predict that the Sydney Morning Herald will continue to lose readership in 2025 for relentlessly lying to their audience and boring them to death,” he wrote in response to a screenshot of my article posted by one of his followers. Elon Musk’s tweet predicting a difficult year for the Sydney Morning Herald.Credit: Twitter Elon was wrong. Statistics from Roy Morgan show the Sydney Morning Herald grew its total readership by 11 per cent in 2025. I too, was wrong. But I was oh so close to being right. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board, with “Tesla’s stock sinking and some investors irritated Musk’s White House focus”, had gotten serious about looking for his successor. “Board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla’s next chief executive, according to people familiar with the discussions,” the newspaper reported. Tesla’s eight-person board, which is chaired by Australian businesswoman Robyn Denholm, denied the accuracy of that report and ultimately went the other way. They issued Musk the largest CEO pay deal ever - a stock-based compensation plan that could be worth close to $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) over roughly a decade - a move designed to keep Musk focused on Tesla rather than shifting his attention elsewhere. Tesla’s chairperson Robyn Denholm said Elon Musk was a “generational leader” and the right CEO during this “transformative period of time.”Credit: Bloomberg So, I maintain that I was on the money with my prediction that Elon’s controversies, distractions and workload were unsustainable. But he didn’t quit Tesla. What about my other predictions? Virtual reality having another year of unfulfilled promise, seems largely accurate. By Apple’s usual standards, sales of its $5999 Vision Pro VR headsets have clearly fallen short of expectations, with the company reportedly selling hundreds of thousands fewer than it had anticipated. Tick. I predicted crypto would soar and bitcoin would surpass $US200,000 - wrong there - and my prediction of an ‘AI winter’ beginning was also off, with AI stocks like Nvidia and others staying hot. Flying cars have also not taken off. They remain decidedly grounded. Some of my other stray predictions seem spot on. It’s early days, but Australia’s teen social media ban has indeed been largely successful so far, with other countries taking notice, and Trump’s tariffs have hit electronics prices. There was no major AI deepfake reported in Australia’s federal election, however. Here are seven predictions for 2026. I’ll probably get half of them wrong. But the fun is in the guessing. The ingredients are all there. Government agencies are rushing to deploy AI for “efficiency.” Corporations are automating decisions about loans, insurance, hiring, and welfare. And Australia’s track record on algorithmic accountability - Robodebt, anyone? - suggests the guardrails aren’t up to the task. The scandal could take several forms: a Services Australia AI that wrongly denies benefits to thousands of vulnerable people; a major employer’s hiring algorithm found to systematically discriminate; a health insurer using AI to deny claims based on race or income ... AI will inevitably stuff up somewhere, the only question is which sector gets caught first. Remember how everyone mocked Google Glass? Meta’s smart glasses are proving that the tech industry’s first instinct - wear a computer on your face - wasn’t wrong, just premature. The difference is in form factor and social acceptability. These actually look like normal sunglasses. You don’t look like a tech bro uberdork wearing them to the pub. And with AI features built in, they’re genuinely useful: real-time translation, object identification (ask them: ‘What am I looking at?’), hands-free messaging, and navigation that doesn’t require you to stare at your phone while walking into traffic. Meta Platforms is seeking to turn its burgeoning smart glasses into a must-have product.Credit: Bloomberg The 2026 iteration will likely add a subtle heads-up display, and that’s when things get interesting. Apple is reportedly working on its own version, which will legitimise the category further. This won’t be VR-style hype, it’ll be more of a slow burn. But by year’s end, smart glasses will be the wearable that actually sticks, succeeding where VR flopped. BYD already outsells Tesla in Australia in some months, and that’s just the beginning. The Chinese manufacturer - along with MG, GWM, and newcomers like Zeekr and Xiaomi - are flooding the market with competent, affordable EVs that legacy carmakers simply can’t match on price. BYD electric vehicles parked in a private storage yard in Kilsyth in Melbourne’s east.Credit: Aaron Francis Australia seems uniquely vulnerable to some of these dynamics: we have no local car manufacturing left, and consumers are historically happy to buy whatever’s cheapest. Tesla’s brand remains politically toxic to some buyers thanks to Musk’s antics, and Ford and Toyota are still playing catch-up when it comes to EVs at scale. By the end of 2026, Chinese manufacturers will command between 30 and 40 per cent of Australia’s EV market, and nobody in Canberra will quite know what to do about it. Nvidia has been the undisputed king of the AI boom. Its processors are the pickaxes in a gold rush that sent its market cap past $US3 trillion. But 2026 is when gravity reasserts itself. Giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are all developing custom AI chips to reduce their dependency on Nvidia, whose sky-high share price has long seemed almost impossible to justify. Critically, the AI infrastructure spending spree can’t continue at this rate forever. At some point, companies need to see returns. This doesn’t mean that Nvidia becomes irrelevant. It just means that its era of unquestioned dominance - and its title as the Most Important Company In The World - ends in 2026. Quantum computing is - maybe - set for a breakout year.Credit: PsiQuantum Quantum computing has been ‘five years away’ for every year I’ve been reporting on the industry. But Google’s Willow chip and IBM’s steady progress on error correction suggest we’re approaching a genuine inflection point. The breakthrough won’t be quantum computers replacing your laptop. It’ll be a clear demonstration of quantum advantage on a problem that actually matters: think simulating a molecule for drug discovery, or cracking an encryption protocol (which will terrify everyone). When it happens, every CEO will suddenly need a ‘quantum strategy’ and start-ups will raise billions on pitch decks that don’t make sense. Most of the hype will be largely premature, just as it was with AI in 2023, but the narrative will shift permanently. Quantum will go from ‘interesting science experiment’ to ‘inevitable technology disruption’ next year. After Optus, Medibank, Latitude, and a parade of smaller breaches, the statistical reality is grim: Australia’s big four banks are operating on borrowed time. They’re attractive targets: massive repositories of sensitive financial data, legacy systems that are barely held together and complex supply chains with countless potential entry points. Australia’s banks have invested heavily in security, but so have every other company that’s been breached. It only takes one missed patch, one phished employee, or one compromised vendor for the worst to happen. And when it does happen, the fallout will be nuclear. Banking data is more sensitive than telco records. The political response will be severe, potentially including personal liability for executives and board members who failed to prioritise security, and regulators like APRA may come into the firing line. The silver lining is that it might be the shock that forces an overhaul of Australia’s approach to cybersecurity, from mandatory breach disclosure timelines to more severe penalties for negligence. The Melanie Perkins-led company times its listing perfectly, riding renewed appetite for profitable tech. Its AI design tools are a moat rather than a commodity, and enterprise adoption accelerates as marketing teams ditch expensive Adobe subscriptions. Canva co-founders Cliff Obrecht and Melanie Perkins, pictured with fellow co-founder Cameron Adams.Credit: Canva The blockbuster public listing on New York’s Nasdaq becomes Australia’s biggest tech success story in history, finally putting Sydney and Australia on the map as a serious global tech hub. Hundreds of new millionaires - many of whom are the company’s early employees - are minted in the process, unlocking a tidal wave of capital. An AI-written song tops the charts; a prominent Australian influencer is exposed as largely AI-generated; Google’s search dominance faces its first real threat in decades. Copyright © 2026

Title: New BioShock 4 leak details Casino location, ‘Flushers’ enemies amid troubled development rumors
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-BioShock-4-leak-details-Casino-location-Flushers-enemies-amid-troubled-development-rumors.1193908.0.html

BioShock, released in 2007, was developed and published by 2K Boston and 2K Australia; the former would later become Irrational Games. The game was set in the city of Rapture, an underwater city built in the 1940s by a wealthy businessman who sought to create a utopia for the elite, free from the control and limitations of governments. To protect Rapture from outside influence, all contact with the outside world is banned. As the city prospered, the wealth disparity grew larger and larger, leaving the top few with more than they needed and the rest to survive on mere crumbs. It was in this poverty-stricken environment that certain events would lead to an all-out war between the city’s wealthy and the downtrodden. The game received universal acclaim, being praised for its narrative themes, visual designs, and gameplay. It is also considered to be one of the best games ever made. It was followed by two sequels, BioShock 2 and BioShock Infinite. Back in December 2019, BioShock 4 was finally announced by 2K Games, along with a new developer, Cloud Chamber, though there was no official release date. Speculation has suggested a 2027-2028 release date. The last time the public had heard of the project was not good news. Leaks told a tale of development hell over the studio, granted, the daunting task of making a sequel to what has been labeled one of the greatest games of all time. A Bloomberg article, following the leaks, suggested that the company was experiencing another shakeup after failing an internal review at 2K Games. According to Bloomberg, 2K said, "working hard to set Bioshock up for the best possible future." It continued, "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path." Recently, an online publication, MP1st, has claimed that leaks shared directly with the publication reveal a Casino that will serve as a prominent setting in the series. It also speaks about two potential vital characters. Flushers, or as the leak calls them, are the standard enemy players might face in the new world of BioShock 4. While the leaks may intrigue players and keep them craving more, it's worth noting that the game was once again delayed due to the 2025 layoffs at Cloud Chamber. BioShock 4 has yet to receive an official release date, but it might be closer to 2027 or 2028 than 2026, even given the leaks reported so far. With Netflix also working on a movie adaptation of the original title, plenty is happening in the BioShock universe, even if gamers will fully experience most of it after a significant time gap.

Title: Dedrone by Axon’s 10th Annual Airspace Security Report 2026
URL: https://soldiersystems.net/2025/12/29/dedrone-by-axons-10th-annual-airspace-security-report-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T23:00:00Z
Full Content:
As the global leader in airspace security, Dedrone by Axon is at the cutting edge of how drone technology is reshaping public safety, enterprise operations, and defense. The sky is becoming one of the most dynamic and contested domains in modern life, that now demands continuous awareness and coordination. The coming years will redefine who protects our airspace and how, as drones become inseparable from daily operations and security missions. The line between “drone use” and “drone defense” is disappearing. This 10th Annual Report includes Dedrone by Axon’s predictions for how this new era of airspace will evolve — and how agencies, enterprises, and nations will adapt to a world where awareness and control of the sky defines safety and security. Airspace is the new front line. We have examined both counter-drone (AKA counter uncrewed aircraft systems or CUAS) trends as well as positive drone usage across public safety and defense sectors. Public Safety & Enterprise CUAS Prediction 1: Exponential Increase in CUAS Adoption Across Public Safety Agencies From stadiums to state fairs: airspace defense becomes part of every security plan. Counter-drone systems will expand far beyond airports and stadiums into every major public venue—from outdoor concerts to parades, sports arenas, and civic gatherings. The World Cup in 2026 and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be the catalysts that normalize counter-drone as part of every large-scale security posture. Expect state and local agencies to begin mandating airspace security audits for any event over a specified attendance threshold. Prediction 2: Airspace Security Becomes an Enterprise Compliance Standard In 2026, airspace security will move from emerging technology to corporate requirement. Major facilities—especially those related to energy, logistics, and technology—will begin including drone detection and tracking in routine physical security audits. Insurance providers and risk assessors will start requiring proof of airspace monitoring, just as they do for cybersecurity today. Airspace intelligence will become a built-in layer of enterprise security infrastructure. Counter-drone sensors will integrate into real-time awareness systems that unify land, air, and perimeter data into a single operational picture. Building automation, access control, and video analytics platforms will all ingest airspace telemetry as a standard data stream, giving enterprises continuous visibility from the ground to the sky. What changes inside the enterprise: • Airspace security added to compliance checklists for insurance and risk audits. • Integration into real-time awareness systems connecting land, air, and perimeter monitoring. • APIs and interoperability standards emerging across physical security, building automation, and video analytics platforms. Prediction 3: The Great Convergence of Positive and Protective Airspace Public safety agencies and enterprises will no longer separate “drone use” from “drone defense.” DFR fleets, delivery operators, and counter-UAS systems will operate within a shared airspace layer where detection, authorization, and deconfliction happen automatically. Airspace awareness will evolve into a common operating picture, connecting public safety, commercial, and enterprise users through shared data and trust protocols. This will blur the line between response and protection—enabling legitimate missions while automatically isolating unknown or unsafe flights. Prediction 4: The Sky Gets Low Altitude Highways Governments and industry will begin establishing structured drone corridors — fixed routes in the low-altitude airspace that function like highways for autonomous flight. The first versions will appear near major metro areas and logistics hubs, coordinated between the FAA, state authorities, and major operators like Amazon, Wing, and Zipline. Each corridor will rely on integrated UTM and counter-UAS technology to manage traffic and prevent incursions. Over time, these drone highways will form a national low-altitude transportation grid, complete with right-of-way rules, altitude tiers, and enforcement mechanisms — the foundation for safe, scalable drone operations in shared airspace. Drone Usage: Drone as First Responder, Delivery, Inspection and More Prediction 5: Drones Become Standard Equipment for Law Enforcement Drones will evolve from a specialized resource into standard patrol gear. Every officer or patrol vehicle will have a small, easily deployable drone for close-quarters and indoor operations—giving officers immediate eyes on a scene during building searches and other confined-space incidents. At the same time, dock-based patrol drones will handle the majority of calls for service and situational awareness. These highly automated systems will launch, recharge, and redeploy on their own, providing continuous overwatch and rapid response across an agency’s coverage area. Together, they will deliver layered aerial support that shortens response times and extends visibility without adding personnel. Prediction 6: Shared Air Support Across Agencies Public safety agencies will begin pooling Drone as First Responder (DFR) resources into local airspace networks. Cloud-based tasking, shared flight zones, and unified command dashboards will let police, fire, and EMS access the same docked drone fleets across neighboring jurisdictions. AI-based flight management will enable one operator to supervise multiple drones simultaneously across active incidents, extending real-time coverage citywide without adding staff. Expect the first public-private DFR consortiums to emerge, delivering local mutual-aid coverage for emergencies, pursuits, and natural disasters. Prediction 7: Part 108 Opens the Skies and Drives the Need for Integrated Airspace Management In 2026, the US FAA will finalize Part 108, unlocking routine BVLOS operations and fuelling mass drone adoption across delivery, inspection, and DFR programs. The rule will clarify right-of-way responsibilities and legitimize autonomous flight at scale. Yet as more authorized drones take flight, airspace deconfliction and counter-UAS will become more critical than ever. Part 108 will expand the need for integrated airspace management, blending drone operations, UTM, and counter-UAS into one connected ecosystem. Additionally, these new standards in the US will encourage other countries to follow suit. The EU, UK, and Australia will begin harmonizing around similar right-of-way and BVLOS standards to enable commercial drone corridors. Global companies like Amazon, UPS, and Zipline will demand consistent counter-UAS frameworks at the same time, creating new opportunities for exportable airspace-security tech. Defense CUAS Prediction 8: UAS Types & Usage Shifts In 2026, the concept of “airspace defense” will expand into multi-domain defense of uncrewed systems, transforming how militaries and public safety agencies think about threat detection and response. Expect increased operational use of Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs), all of which are capable of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and payload delivery missions within their respective operational environments. Micro-sized drones, including insect-like “cybugs” and bio-hybrid platforms, will move from prototype to field testing, offering near-undetectable capabilities for espionage, sabotage, or facility infiltration. Simultaneously, nations will accelerate investment in autonomous or semi-autonomous interceptor drones designed to disable or capture hostile drones in midair, bridging the gap between electronic warfare that disrupts signals and traditional kinetic countermeasures. These will include net-based, kinetic, and energy-based systems, purpose-built to operate safely over populated or sensitive areas. As RF-based defenses become ubiquitous, adversaries will shift toward RF-silent and fully autonomous drones, rendering legacy RF-controlled systems obsolete. Prediction 9: Defense Primes Will Begin to Operate with More of a Startup Mindset Long development timelines and proprietary hardware / software will become increasingly unacceptable to defense customers. With speed to field becoming a procurement requirement, traditional defense primes will begin to operate more like startups, leveraging open architecture designs and making decisions to buy versus build more often. Prediction 10: Shift from CUAS “Air Walls” to Fully Networked & Integrated CUAS Systems Air walls which exist only at the border are no longer sufficient. We have seen that drones can be smuggled into a country while powered off and then take off once they are well past the air wall – in depth – conducting devastatingly effective missions. These incidents will not only push nations to expand their internal detection networks but also to form multi-country CUAS collaborations, beginning in Europe and later extending through NATO and Indo-Pacific partnerships. These networks will expand on the initial air wall concept by establishing comprehensive networked CUAS systems which exist not only at the border, but also deep within each country. These CUAS coalitions will leverage shared airspace intelligence protocols, enabling the exchange of drone signatures, RF telemetry, and incident data in real time. Prediction 11: AI-Mediated Engagement Decisions The next evolution of counter-UAS systems will pair AI decision-support with human oversight, mirroring missile-defense frameworks. Automated sensors and targeting algorithms will evaluate speed, flight path, and threat behavior to generate real-time “shoot/no-shoot” recommendations, placing humans on the loop rather than fully in control. This model will enable faster, safer responses in complex airspace and reduce the cognitive burden on operators managing multiple threats at once. Ethical and policy debates will intensify as militaries test the balance between automation and accountability in kinetic engagements. This year’s predictions highlight the rapid convergence of drone operations and airspace security. Public safety agencies are integrating drones into daily response. Enterprises are expanding their use of aerial data. Governments are redefining airspace policy while preparing for new classes of threats. Drones now serve every mission — and challenge every boundary. The next phase of airspace security is about managing coexistence and countering threats across defense, public safety, and enterprise domains. Boneyard Prediction 8: Airspace Defense Becomes Multi-Domain Defense The counter-drone mission will no longer be isolated to the air. In 2026, we’ll see increased use of underwater, surface, ground-based and micro-sized uncrewed systems, requiring integrated command and sensor layers across domains. • Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) used to surveil or conduct attacks on maritime vessels or infrastructure. • Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs) adapted for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and payload delivery missions. • Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) used for surveillance or to conduct attacks on maritime vessels or critical infrastructure. • Micro Uncrewed Vehicles such as Insect-sized “cybugs” and bio-hybrid drones will move from experimental to operational testing. Their small size, low heat output, and biological camouflage will make them nearly undetectable to conventional sensors, enabling new forms of espionage, sabotage, and infiltration inside secure facilities Prediction 9: Rise of ‘Drone-on-Drone’ Interceptors Expect an explosion of interceptor drone programs — autonomous or semi-autonomous UAS designed to physically disable or capture hostile drones midair. They will bridge the gap between “soft kill” electronic measures and conventional firepower. Methods will include net-based, kinetic, and energy-based interceptors that can operate safely over populated areas. Prediction 10: Radio Frequency (RF) Controlled Drones Will Become Obsolete on the Battlefield As RF-based counter-drone technology is fully integrated at the tactical edge, adversaries will all but abandon traditional RF controlled drones, instead focusing on RF-silent, autonomous technology.

LAST UPDATED: December 29, 2025 at 12:49 PM GUEST POST from Art Inteligencia In the world of corporate strategy, we love to manufacture myths of inevitable visionary genius. We look at the behemoths of today and assume their current dominance was etched in stone a decade ago by a leader who could see through the fog of time. But as someone who has spent a career studying Human-Centered Innovation and the mechanics of innovation, I can tell you that the reality is often much messier. And this is no different when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), so much so that it could be said that AI stands for Accidental Innovation. Take, for instance, the meteoric rise of Nvidia. Today, they are the undisputed architects of the intelligence age, a company whose hardware powers the Large Language Models (LLMs) reshaping our world. Yet, if we pull back the curtain, we find a story of survival, near-acquisitions, and a heavy dose of serendipity. Nvidia didn’t build their current empire because they predicted the exact nuances of the generative AI explosion; they built it because they were lucky enough to have developed technology for a completely different purpose that happened to be the perfect fuel for the AI fire. — Braden Kelley It is difficult to imagine now, but there was a point in the Future Present where Nvidia was seen as a vulnerable hardware player. In the mid-2010s, as the Virtual Reality (VR) hype began to peak, Nvidia’s focus was heavily tethered to the gaming market. Internal histories and industry whispers suggest that the Oculus division of Meta (then Facebook) explored the idea of acquiring or deeply merging with Nvidia’s core graphics capabilities to secure their own hardware vertical. At the time, Nvidia’s valuation was a fraction of what it is today. Had that acquisition occurred, the “Corporate Antibodies” of a social media giant would likely have stifled the very modularity that makes Nvidia great today. Instead of becoming the generic compute engine for the world, Nvidia might have been optimized—and narrowed—into a specialized silicon shop for VR headsets. It was a sliding doors moment for the entire tech industry. By not being acquired, Nvidia maintained the autonomy to follow the scent of demand wherever it led next. Before the “Magnificent Seven” era, Nvidia was struggling to find its next big act beyond PC gaming. When Meta acquired Oculus, there was a desperate need for low-latency, high-performance GPUs to make VR viable. The relationship between the two companies was so symbiotic that some analysts argued a vertical integration was the only logical step. Had Mark Zuckerberg moved more aggressively to bring Nvidia under the Meta umbrella, the GPU might have become a proprietary tool for the Metaverse. Because this deal failed to materialize, Nvidia remained an open ecosystem, allowing researchers at Google and OpenAI to eventually use that same hardware for a little thing called a Transformer model. The second major “accident” in Nvidia’s journey was the Cryptocurrency boom. For years, Nvidia’s stock and production cycles were whipped around by the price of Ethereum. To the outside world, this looked like a distraction—a volatile market that Nvidia was chasing to satisfy shareholders. However, the crypto miners demanded exactly what AI would later require: massive, parallel processing power and specialized chips (ASICs and high-end GPUs) that could perform simple calculations millions of times per second. Nvidia leaned into this demand, refining their CUDA platform and their manufacturing scale. They weren’t building for LLMs yet; they were building for miners. But in doing so, they solved the scalability problem of parallel computing. When the “AI Winter” ended and the industry realized that Deep Learning was the path forward, Nvidia didn’t have to invent a new chip. They just had to rebrand the one they had already perfected for the blockchain. Preparation met opportunity, but the opportunity wasn’t the one they had initially invited to the dance. In 2021, Nvidia’s primary concern was “Lite Hash Rate” (LHR) cards to deter crypto miners so gamers could finally buy GPUs. This era of forced scaling forced Nvidia to master the art of data-center-grade reliability. When ChatGPT arrived, the transition was seamless. The “Accidental Innovation” here was that the mathematical operations required to verify a block on a chain are fundamentally similar to the vector mathematics required to predict the next word in a sentence. Nvidia had built the world’s best token-prediction machine while thinking they were building the world’s best ledger-validation machine. While Nvidia currently sits on the throne of Accidental Innovation, the next wave of change-makers is already emerging by attempting to turn that accident into a deliberate architecture. Cerebras Systems is building “wafer-scale” engines that dwarf traditional GPUs, aiming to eliminate the networking bottlenecks that Nvidia’s “accidental” legacy still carries. Groq (not to be confused with the AI model) is focusing on LPU (Language Processing Units) that prioritize the inference speed necessary for real-time human interaction. In the software layer, Modular is working to decouple the AI software stack from specific hardware, potentially neutralizing Nvidia’s CUDA moat. Finally, keep an eye on CoreWeave, which has pivoted from crypto mining to become a specialized “AI cloud,” proving that Nvidia’s accidental path is a blueprint others can follow by design. We must stop teaching innovation as a series of deliberate masterstrokes. When we do that, we discourage leaders from experimenting. If you believe you must see the entire future before you act, you will stay paralyzed. Nvidia’s success is a testament to Agile Resilience. They built a powerful, flexible tool, stayed independent during a crucial acquisition window, and were humble enough to let the market show them what their technology was actually good for. As we move into this next phase of the Future Present, the lesson is clear: don’t just build for the world you see today. Build for the accidents of tomorrow. Because in the end, the most impactful innovations are rarely the ones we planned; they are the ones we were ready for.

Title: Silver’s Sharp Plunge: Bitcoin-Style Flash Crash or Healthy Pullback Before $100?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Basius77 / Shutterstock.com In 2025, silver surged to record highs, topping $80 per ounce and briefly reaching $84 before retreating. Starting the year around $29 per ounce, the metal has delivered gains of over 160%, outperforming gold, stocks, and most asset classes. This rally has drawn parallels to Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), which earlier surged past $126,000 amid predictions of $200,000 or more, fueling a buying frenzy. However, Bitcoin suffered a flash crash on Oct. 10, triggered by leverage deleveraging and broader market stress, leading to over $19 billion in liquidations and a more than 30% drop from highs. Silver followed a similar path, with traders eyeing momentum to carry it past $100 per ounce. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV), the largest silver ETF, closed at a high of $71.12 per share on Dec 26 while silver peaked at $83.62 — just before profit-taking and margin hikes sent it down over 11% to around $73 per ounce this morning. Investors now question if silver will mirror Bitcoin’s plunge. Bitcoin’s flash crash stemmed from high leverage in a thin market, amplified by political shocks like tariff threats that created a risk-off environment. Over $19 billion in positions were liquidated in hours, driven by overleveraged traders and whale panic-selling near highs. Unlike prior cycles with retail dominance, 2025 saw institutional participation, yet its correlation with equities strengthened, exposing crypto to broader risk-off moves. Bitcoin could face further downside if macroeconomic pressures persist, such as delayed rate cuts or trade tensions rising again. Its value relies heavily on sentiment and adoption expectations, lacking the tangible utility backing other assets and even other cryptocurrencies. While long-term potential exists from institutional and potential government interest, short-term volatility remains high without any physical demand to anchor it. Silver’s recent 11% drop echoes Bitcoin’s volatility, raising fears of a deeper correction. Profit-taking after record highs, margin hikes on the Comex Metals Exchange (CME), and year-end positioning contributed to the pullback. However, silver’s fundamentals differ markedly from Bitcoin’s speculative base. Silver’s primary driver is industrial use, which accounts for over half of demand. Applications in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and AI infrastructure continue growing. Solar alone consumes a significant share, with global installations pushing consumption higher despite efficiency improvements. U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 enhanced silver’s appeal, as they made buying less risky in a rate-easing environment. That offered support for the rally alongside ETF inflows and central bank buying. Most critical is silver’s structural deficit. The market has faced consecutive annual shortfalls, with 2025 estimates around 115 million to 120 million ounces unmet by mine production. Supply remains inelastic — silver is largely a byproduct of other mining — and recycling covers only a portion. Inventories in major vaults have shrunk, tightening physical availability. Unlike Bitcoin, whose supply is algorithmic and based on perceptions of its value, silver has intrinsic industrial utility. This physical backing provides support that is absent in crypto, limiting downside risk even during dips. Further pullbacks are possible — even likely — en route to higher levels, as volatility persists and the speculative froth surrounding the white metal unwinds. Yet the supply-demand imbalance favors sustained upside beyond current records. The iShares Silver Trust offers investors the most efficient way to gain silver exposure. Backed by physical bullion held in vaults, it avoids the storage, insurance, and assay costs of owning coins or bars. As the largest silver ETF managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), it provides liquidity and direct price tracking. Surface parallels to Bitcoin’s crash may spark caution, but silver’s structural support — rooted in irreplaceable industrial demand and ongoing deficits — sets it apart. The 2025 run-up included more than a dash of irrational exuberance, yet silver’s underlying fundamentals point to further gains and higher highs ahead.

Title: BlackRock's BUIDL hits $100M in payouts, showing tokenized finance at scale

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund has distributed $100 million from Treasury yields, offering a real-world test of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s first tokenized money market fund has paid out $100 million in cumulative dividends since its launch, highlighting the growing real-world use of tokenized securities amid rising institutional adoption. The milestone for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) was announced Monday by Securitize, which serves as the fund’s issuer and tokenization partner, overseeing onchain issuance and investor onboarding. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL was initially issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The fund invests in short-term, US dollar–denominated assets, including US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and cash equivalents, offering institutional investors a blockchain-based vehicle to earn yield while maintaining liquidity. Investors purchase BUIDL tokens pegged to the US dollar and receive dividend distributions directly onchain, reflecting income generated from the underlying assets. Since its debut on Ethereum, BUIDL has expanded to additional blockchains, including Solana, Aptos, Avalanche and Optimism. The $100 million milestone is notable because it represents lifetime payouts derived from actual Treasury yields distributed to holders of onchain fund tokens. It demonstrates that tokenized securities can operate at scale while mirroring the core functions of traditional financial products. The development also underscores the operational efficiencies enabled by blockchain technology, including faster settlement, transparent ownership records and programmable distributions, features that are increasingly drawing interest from large asset managers and institutional investors exploring tokenized real-world assets. BUIDL, in particular, has seen strong adoption, with the value of the tokenized fund surpassing $2 billion earlier this year. Related: Fragmentation drains up to $1.3B a year from tokenized assets: Report Tokenized money market funds have quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the onchain RWA market, and for good reason. Their appeal lies in their ability to deliver money market–style returns with greater operational efficiency, a dynamic that has begun to draw attention from traditional financial institutions. Some market participants view these products as a potential counterweight to the anticipated growth of stablecoins. In July, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho said tokenized money market funds preserve the longstanding appeal of “cash as an asset,” even as regulatory developments such as the approval of the GENIUS Act were expected to accelerate stablecoin adoption and potentially erode the role of cash-like instruments. Despite their rapid growth, tokenized money market funds have also attracted industry scrutiny. The Bank for International Settlements recently warned that such products could introduce operational and liquidity risks, particularly as they become an increasingly important source of collateral within the digital asset ecosystem.

The US dollar has declined against all of its main global peers in 2025, and the Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — is down 10% this year. There have been multiple catalysts for the decrease, none more prevalent than the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates multiple times. Generally speaking, when a central bank lowers rates, holding a currency becomes less attractive. There's also the matter of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, which particularly roiled markets in the first half of 2025. Investors viewed his potential levies as negative for growth and a source of uncertainty, both of which were dollar-negative. But let's not get too doom-and-gloom about a weak dollar. There are positives too. Detailed below are the two pros and two cons of a depreciating currency: A weaker US currency offers other countries more purchasing power, which can boost exports and economic growth. It can also support US industries that depend heavily on exports, like manufacturing and agriculture. The US exported $125 billion more goods and services in the nine months leading up to September than it did the same period last year, the Census Bureau said this month, an increase of 5%. President Donald Trump pointed out the benefits of a weaker dollar when speaking to the press in July, suggesting that the US could "make a hell of a lot more money" when the greenback was weak. "When we have a strong dollar, one thing happens: It sounds good. But you don't do any tourism. You can't sell tractors, you can't sell trucks, you can't sell anything," he said at the White House. "Pushing down the dollar's value has been a policy priority for the administration as it sought in part to make exports more attractive," Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, wrote in a note on Monday. There are also positive implications for the labor market. If export-heavy industries like manufacturing and agriculture are thriving, that can create more jobs. A boost to international sales is inherently good news for US firms that sell goods abroad. That applies to most of the S&P 500, where foreign sales are significant for at least half of the index's companies, Hogan said. "I would say the pros and cons for corporate America are more tailwinds than headwinds," he added. After the US dollar recorded its worst first half of the year in nearly half a century, Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, said the bank believed a weaker greenback was an underappreciated "tailwind" from an earnings perspective. "There's no doubt that a weaker dollar is part of the story for why revision factors have continued to move — even faster recovery than we had expected," he said, speaking to CNBC earlier in the year. A cheaper dollar could also be a boon for unhedged international equities, or shares of international stocks in local currencies, BlackRock said in a recent client note. That's partly because foreign firms are gaining purchasing power as their local currencies strengthen against the greenback. On the other hand, a weaker currency in the US can translate to higher prices for US consumers of imported goods, or goods with imported parts. That adds to inflationary pressures that already hang in the background with Trump's tariffs. Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November — below what economists expected, but still above the Fed's long-run 2% inflation target. "For everyday Americans, the story is a bit opposite," Hogan said. "The buying power of your dollar goes down as the value of the dollar goes down against the basket of other currencies. So it does make it harder to keep up with higher cost of goods." Americans on vacation could also facing higher costs, as a weaker dollar has less purchasing power abroad, Hogan added. On the flip side, it also makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination for foreigners, who have gained purchasing power. "There's puts and takes," he said. "If you're planning that European vacation, it's going to cost you a bit more in that currency translation." Jump to

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, powering much of the infrastructure behind generative AI and data centers. This demand propelled its market capitalization to $4.5 trillion, supported by a roughly 39% year-to-date gain in its stock price. Yet concerns persist about increasing competition from rivals and a potential slowdown in AI spending, raising fears of an AI bubble burst. While the stock’s performance may feel disappointing to some investors after explosive gains in prior years, a near-40% return would have been phenomenal for Nvidia 10 years ago. But had you had the foresight to invest $10,000 in the stock in early January 2016 and hold through today, the results tell a remarkable story of transformation. It is important to see where Nvidia came from over the past decade to understand where it stands today. In early 2016, Nvidia primarily focused on graphics processing units for PC gaming. Its GeForce lineup dominated the market for video game graphics accelerators, delivering high-performance visuals for gamers. The company generated record annual revenue in fiscal 2016, largely from its gaming segment, which accounted for about three quarters of the total. At the time, AI applications remained in their infancy and had not yet entered the public consciousness as a viable technology for changing industry and the world around us. Back then, Nvidia’s data center business was small, generating only $339 million for all of 2015. The stock traded at split-adjusted prices around $0.80 per share as the new year began, accounting for subsequent splits, including the 4-for-1 split in 2021 and the 10-for-1 split in 2024. Nvidia’s evolution accelerated in the late 2010s. The metaverse was a thing for 15 minutes until cryptocurrency mining surged between 2017 and 2018, with miners using Nvidia GPUs for proof-of-work algorithms in coins like Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). This drove unexpected demand, boosting gaming segment revenue despite volatility — Nvidia noted crypto’s contributions but maintained its focus on its core gaming GPUs. As crypto mining waned after several market crashes, Nvidia shifted toward AI and deep learning. Researchers had used its GPUs for machine learning since the early 2010s, and the company released products like the DGX-1 in 2016 for AI training. Explosive growth in generative AI after 2022 — ChatGPT was released in late November that year the public began to take notice — cemented Nvidia as the premier AI chipmaker, with its data center segment now dominating. Nvidia’s revenue transformation has been just as dramatic. Where 2016 annual revenue stood at $5 billion, Nvidia reported $57 billion in revenue for just the third quarter of fiscal 2026 — exceeding the entire 2016 yearly figure tenfold in just three months. Its stock price growth mirrored this shift. From those penny-per-share split-adjusted levels near January 2016, Nvidia is currently trading above $187 per share today. This represents a price appreciation of over 23,600%. Considering Nvidia’s entire market cap was about $17 billion a decade ago, it’s not surprising to learn you would be sitting on a not-so-small fortune with it priced at $4.5 trillion. But how big is big? Over the last 10 years, Nvidia’s total return — yes, the chipmaker pays a nominal dividend yielding 0.02% — would have turned a $10,000 investment in early January 2016 into more than $2.37 million. This performance underscores Nvidia’s successful pivot from gaming to AI leadership, turning early investors into millionaires despite the occasional downturn. It’s why you should buy stocks with the idea of never selling them, and holding on through periods of volatility. It’s not necessary that all your stocks perform like Nvidia, as just one monster homerun swing can set you up for life. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

UPDATED 11:05 EST / DECEMBER 29 2025 by Kyt Dotson Seoul-based financial firm Mirae Asset Financial Group is considering buying Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit Inc., the Korea Times reported today. The Korean cryptocurrency market is dominated by Upbit and Bithumb, which represent over 95% of the exchange volume in the country. As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Korbit serves as an entry point for Mirae into the cryptocurrency industry, which has traditionally focused on traditional finance since its founding in the late 1990s. Founded in 2013, Korbit, also known as 코빗 (Ko-bit) in Korean, began as Korea’s first cryptocurrency exchange, pioneering bitcoin trading in Korean won. Although it opened the market to the local population and paved the way for early trading infrastructure, it was quickly surpassed by the larger exchanges. Today, it still remains a key player in the market. Officials at Mirae said the company is in talks to acquire a 60.5% stake in Kobit from its parent company, NXC Corp., the exchange’s largest shareholder, and a 31.5% from SK Planet. NXC is the family holding group that owns a controlling stake in major South Korea-based global video game giant Nexon Co. Ltd., a developer and publisher known for games like MapleStory and Dungeon Fighter Online. The deal is estimated at up to 140 billion won, around $97.5 million total. The purchase would be led by Mirae Asset Consulting, the group’s real estate and consulting affiliate controlled by founder Park Hyeon-joo and his wife. Mirae offers asset management, wealth management, investment banking and insurance. Since its founding, it established itself as a prominent leader in traditional finance. An unnamed industry official quoted by the Korea Times noted that Park, now global strategy officer, previously emphasized exploring business opportunities that interconnect traditional finance to digital assets. “Korbit has historically had a limited presence, but Mirae Asset Financial Group’s decades of expertise could allow it to pursue a differentiated strategy,” he added. The purchase could shift the current nature of Korea’s cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape. Kobit maintains a large number of regulatory licenses in the country. The acquisition news follows increasing outreach throughout the global market by major financial firms, including MasterCard Inc., multinational investment management firm BlackRock Inc. and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc.

December 29, 2025 10:38 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA News Group News Commentary – The counter-unmanned aircraft system market is projected to reach $20.31 billion by 2030, growing from $6.64 billion in 2025 at a 25.1% compound annual growth rate, driven by accelerating threats from hostile drones across military and critical infrastructure domains[1]. The Space Development Agency awarded $3.5 billion in contracts this month for 72 missile tracking satellites designed to detect hypersonic threats from low Earth orbit, signaling the Pentagon's pivot toward integrated deterrence architectures that prioritize space-based sensing and autonomous response systems[2]. This convergence of orbital surveillance and tactical edge protection drives the investment thesis for VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV), and BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI). The military unmanned systems market is projected to reach $76.05 billion by 2035 from $28.02 billion in 2025, reflecting a 10.5% annual growth rate fueled by Department of Defense mandates for multi-domain autonomous platforms[3]. The AI in defense sector is expected to surge from $12.55 billion in 2024 to $178.14 billion by 2034 at a 30.38% compound annual growth rate[4], as battlefield commanders demand machine-speed decision frameworks capable of countering hypersonic missiles, drone swarms, and contested space environments. VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV) recently completed the acquisition of Solar Drone Ltd., an autonomous robotics company and subsidiary of BladeRanger, marking the defense technology developer's first acquisition since its July 2025 public listing. The transaction closed through a Share Purchase Agreement involving 1,800,000 shares of common stock, positioning VisionWave to address defense applications alongside the solar operations and maintenance robotics market. “The completion of the Solar Drone acquisition marks an important inflection point for VisionWave,” said Douglas Davis, Executive Chairman of VisionWave. “This is not a standalone asset, but a platform capability that strengthens our autonomous robotics roadmap across defense, security, and critical infrastructure. We believe Solar Drone may accelerate our ability to deploy intelligent, mission-ready systems at scale.” The acquisition provides VisionWave with access to autonomous systems designed for critical infrastructure monitoring across more than 165 GW of installed U.S. utility-scale solar capacity and over 260 GW in Europe. Solar Drone completed a 100-day Proof of Concept with DB InfraGO AG through DB mindbox, with DB InfraGO AG recommending advancement to discussions with Sky Operations, DB Services, and DB Energie departments. The company's autonomous robotics capabilities complement VisionWave's development of Unmanned Ground Vehicle platforms and counter-drone systems designed for defense and security applications. The integration of Solar Drone's technologies supports VisionWave's strategy to deliver autonomous solutions across multiple operational domains. VisionWave initiated the patent application process for a planned series of patents covering key technologies underlying Argus, the company's space-enabled, AI-driven counter-unmanned aircraft system developed in collaboration with BladeRanger. The intellectual property strategy targets Argus's core architecture including the SkyWeave high-frequency communications backbone, space and ground-based drone detection methods, and end-to-end decision frameworks for detection, classification, tracking, and engagement. Additional filings are expected to address HF-enabled sensor fusion, multi-layer control logic, and secure encryption mechanisms optimized for contested environments. VisionWave announced a non-binding letter of intent with Evie Autonomous Limited to explore a £500,000 Proof-of-Concept program integrating autonomous vehicle technology into VisionWave's Unmanned Ground Vehicle platforms. The POC program targets advanced navigation and multi-sensor fusion capabilities for the Varan UGV platform unveiled in November 2025, with discussions anticipated to continue into 2026 pending definitive agreements. The partnership discussions align with VisionWave's expansion of its London-based UGV research and development engineering team. VisionWave's acquisition strategy and technology development initiatives position the company to address defense, security, and commercial markets through a multi-domain autonomy approach spanning counter-UAS systems, autonomous ground vehicles, and industrial robotics applications.

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai, Scale Can you really grow in B2B in 2026 if you aren’t tapping into AI budget? The short answer: Probably not. Here’s the real data. It may in fact be your last, best change to tap into it. Something fundamentally different happened in 2025. AI budgets stopped being “innovation fund” line items and became core IT spending. And in 2026? They’re becoming the only growth budget that matters. AI is the growth engine not just of software, but the entire U.S. (and beyond) economy. Let discuss what’s actually happening—with real numbers from the companies winning right now. Here’s the eye-opening stat from Andreessen Horowitz’s survey of 100 enterprise CIOs: Enterprise leaders expect an average of ~75% growth in LLM budgets over the next year. And as one CIO put it: “What I spent in 2023 I now spend in a week.” But here’s what really matters for B2B founders: Last year, innovation budgets made up 25% of LLM spending. That’s now dropped to just 7%. AI has graduated from experiment to core operating expense. What does that mean practically? According to ISG’s research, while overall IT budgets are rising just 1.8% (basically inflation), AI spending is increasing 5.7%—with nearly a quarter of enterprises planning 10%+ increases. AI is now capturing 30% of the total IT budget increase despite being a fraction of overall spend. Gartner forecasts global AI spending will approach $1.5 trillion in 2025, with enterprise software and infrastructure alone hitting nearly $500 billion in 2026. Meanwhile, worldwide IT spending will grow 9.8% to exceed $6 trillion for the first time—but software specifically is projected to grow 15.2% year-over-year. Here’s the brutal math for B2B companies: So where do they find budget for AI initiatives? They steal it from somewhere else. The question is: Are you going to be stealing budget? Or getting stolen from? Your Job In AI + B2B in 2026: Grab The Tailwinds, For Real. It’s Not Too Late. But It’s Different. Want to see what happens when you tap into AI budget vs. when you don’t? Just look at the public markets this year. The Winners (AI-Native or AI Infrastructure): The Losers (Traditional SaaS, SMB-Focused, or “Added AI”): That’s a 4.7x difference in valuation multiple between high-growth AI companies and slow-growth traditional SaaS. The market is telling us something. The Great B2B Bifurcation of 2025: Why Some SaaS Stocks Are Up 142% While Others Are Down 51% Palantir’s story is remarkable. Revenue growth bottomed at 12.7% in Q2 2023—the exact quarter they launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). By H1 2025, revenue was up 44% year-over-year, with $541 million in net income (up 125%). The company’s Q3 showed what AI-native means financially: 63% revenue growth with 51% operating margins.Their Rule of 68 score (growth rate plus operating margin) is exceptional. Free cash flow crossed $1 billion trailing twelve months. Palantir’s CTO Shyam Sankar captures the thesis: “The models are converging while pricing for inference is dropping significantly. This only strengthens our conviction that the value is in the application and workflow layer.” The lesson? Don’t add AI to existing products. Build AI operating systems from scratch. ServiceNow’s Q3 2025 shattered expectations with $3.41 billion in revenue, up 22% year-over-year. Their AI-related Annual Contract Value is approaching $500 million, and they’re targeting $1 billion in AI-specific revenue in 2026. What’s working? They’re not just adding chatbots. They’re shipping autonomous AI agents that resolve complex IT outages and HR requests without human intervention. The “Xanadu” and “Yokohama” platform releases introduced agents that execute tasks, not just suggest answers. CEO Bill McDermott calls it the “enterprise nerve center.” The TAM for ServiceNow is expanding to $275 billion by 2026 as they move beyond IT into AI-powered customer service, HR, and cross-enterprise workflows. MongoDB was left for dead in August 2025, trading at $214 with sentiment at rock bottom. Then came Q3: Atlas growth accelerated to 30% YoY, FCF jumped 306% to $140 million, and guidance was raised to $2.43-2.44 billion. Why the turnaround? AI applications deal with messy, unstructured data—exactly what document databases handle well. As Menlo Ventures noted: “The companies winning in 2025 are infrastructure plays (Palantir, MongoDB, Cloudflare, Snowflake) rather than application plays.” Infrastructure benefits from AI. Applications get disrupted by it. MongoDB: The Great(est) AI Turnaround Story of 2025 Marc Benioff went all-in on agents, and Q3 showed signs it’s working. Agentforce now serves 18,500 enterprise customers (up from 12,500 last quarter), running more than 3 billion automated workflows monthly and pushing past $540 million in ARR from agentic products. They added 6,000 new enterprise customers in one quarter for Agentforce—while everyone else was talking about an AI bubble. Current remaining performance obligations are up 15% (versus 10% estimates). The Futurum Group placed Salesforce at the top of its agentic AI platform rankings, slightly ahead of Microsoft. That matters for 2026. CrowdStrike is up 51% YTD despite a major outage in July 2024. Why? Security spending is non-discretionary. CIOs told Morgan Stanley they expect cybersecurity spending to grow 50% faster than overall software spending. Their Falcon platform now includes endpoint, cloud workload, identity, and SIEM. 49% of customers use 6+ modules.Q3 showed subscription revenue up 21% to $1.17 billion, with net new ARR of $265 million (up 73% YoY). Their AI SIEM business grew 95% in 2025. The ambitious target: $20 billion ARR by fiscal year 2036. HubSpot fell from $880 to $370—a 51% decline—making it the worst-performing major B2B stock of 2025. The irony? The business is actually performing fine: Q2 revenue hit $760.9 million (up 19.4%), and they raised full-year guidance to $3.08 billion. The problem is perception. The market is pricing in maximum AI disruption risk for SMB-focused horizontal SaaS. When AI can potentially reduce the need for human marketing and sales users, seat-based pricing becomes a liability. HubSpot launched Breeze AI in September 2024, including customer agents, prospecting agents, and content agents. But as Benioff acknowledged about Salesforce, agents could be “a victim of their own success”—if agents reduce the need for human users, you sell fewer seats. The challenge for 2026: How do you monetize AI when your customers expect AI features without paying extra? Look at the broader pattern: HubSpot (-51%), Monday.com (-36%), Atlassian (-34%), Asana (struggling). These are all horizontal tools for broad use cases. Meanwhile, vertical solutions with deep domain expertise are defensible: Veeva for life sciences, Guidewire for insurance, Procore for construction. The lesson: Horizontal tools are under pressure. Vertical solutions with domain expertise have moats. According to Market Clarity’s analysis of Gartner data: The PwC survey of 308 US senior executives found: This isn’t tech companies only. It’s across all industries. Gartner: Enterprise Software Spend Will Grow a Stunning 15.2% Next Year. But Most Of That Will Go to Price Increases and AI Apps The winners in 2025—Palantir, Cursor, Gamma—didn’t “add AI.” They are AI companies that solve specific problems. The architecture is different. The economics are different. The customer expectation is different. Gamma reached $100M ARR profitably with just 50 people. That’s $2M ARR per employee. They’re competing against PowerPoint, which was invented before the first website existed. AI enables you to compete in markets that seemed settled—but you need to be 10x better, not 10% better. According to Iconiq Capital, AI-native companies show superior burn efficiency: For companies under $100M ARR, AI-native burns 0.4x their net new ARR, while median burns 2.0x. This advantage compounds over time. Rule #3: Some / Most Consumption-Based or Outcome-Based Pricing Really Helps Seat-based pricing made sense when software helped humans do their jobs better. Consumption-based or outcome-based pricing makes sense when AI does the job instead. HubSpot is moving toward credits-based pricing for Breeze Customer Agent. This transition will define who survives the next phase. Leaders like Cursor, Replit, etc. have per seat pricing at their core. But the majority of their revenue in many cases, or a large portion of it, comes from usage beyond the monthly fee. That’s not practical for pre-AI SaaS applications. But if you add so much value with your AI Agent, it just might make sense there. Every winner solves problems that enterprises literally cannot deprioritize: Let me give you the honest answer based on all this data: If you’re infrastructure: You’ll likely grow regardless, but AI workloads are accelerating that growth significantly. If you’re mission-critical (security, data, compliance): AI is adding to your growth, not replacing it. Budget is flowing your direction. If you’re horizontal SaaS with seat-based pricing: You’re fighting headwinds. Every customer expects AI features but doesn’t want to pay more. Meanwhile, AI-native startups are attacking your TAM with 6x your efficiency. If you’re vertical SaaS with domain expertise: AI is an opportunity to deepen your moat. Domain-specific AI is defensible in ways horizontal AI is not. If you’re SMB-focused: The market is pricing in maximum disruption risk. You need to prove AI enhances your value rather than cannibalizes it. The bottom line: 76% of AI use cases are now purchased rather than built internally. Enterprise buyers want ready-made AI solutions. AI buyers convert at 47% vs. SaaS’ 25%, indicating AI delivers enough immediate value to short-circuit standard procurement. The companies capturing this budget in 2026 will be the ones who built AI-native from day one—or successfully transformed before the window closed. The window is closing.

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai, Scale Can you really grow in B2B in 2026 if you aren’t tapping into AI budget? The short answer: Probably not. Here’s the real data. It may in fact be your last, best change to tap into it. Something fundamentally different happened in 2025.

Title: Entertainment and Media Layoffs Up 18% With Over 17,000 Jobs Slashed in 2025
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/business/entertainment-media-layoffs-2025-analysis/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T14:12:32Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A wave of consolidation, AI-driven change and cost-cutting pushed entertainment and media layoffs sharply higher in 2025 After a slight dip in layoffs in 2024, the entertainment and media industry jobs suffered through another difficult year. In 2025, over 17,000 jobs were cut across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming in the first 11 months of the year. This figure was up 18% from last year, continuing a trend from the past few years as the industry has wrestled with consolidation and other pressures like the double strikes in 2023. News alone, including broadcast, digital and print, suffered 2,254 job cuts to date, 179 of which occurred in November, but for the year, cuts were down 50% from the 4,537 job losses announced during the same period last year. The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation, according to Challenger. This summer the FCC officially approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, leading to layoffs across the Paramount entertainment business. Disney laid off hundreds this year, as part of CEO Bob Iger’s 2023 initiative to cut costs amid an audience migration away from cable TV subscriptions to streaming platforms. A World Economic Forum survey also found that 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI’s ability to handle more more complicated tasks have led to companies cutting jobs, although the actual return on investment of AI tools has been disappointing. Correspondingly, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. As AI cements itself into everyday life, digital media companies struggle. Sites that relied heavily on SEO and search are having to adapt strategy, leading some to shutter, like Teen Vogue. Layoffs across Condé Nast and Penske-owned properties removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations as a result. And PBS lost federal funding under President Donald Trump, forcing it to cut 15% of its staff. These job losses underscore a more broadly weaker job market, with November seeing more than 71,000 layoffs overall, the second highest over the last five years, behind only the 2022 cuts, according to said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Challenger also noted that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from year-end layoff announcements. From 2010 to 2017, the media industry lost 7,305 jobs per year on average, according to Challenger’s data. Since 2018, the average number of annual job cuts has jumped to 14,298. There is one industry in the entertainment business that is growing, though: the creator economy. As other industries shrink, the digital creator industry has only grown in 2025. From 2022 to 2024, L.A. employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, employment in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. The microdramas business has also grown this year, employing Hollywood production crews, nonunion actors and writers to create bite-sized, bingeable episodes that turn a profit. In just four years since the launch of these vertical dramas, the genre’s market has surpassed $8 billion globally, according to Media Partners Asia. Below is a look back at a grisly year that is increasingly becoming the norm for the news and entertainment industries. The entertainment industry suffered thousands of job losses this year as industry consolidation and contraction hit companies like Paramount, NBCUniversal, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. The FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger in July, placing the company under CEO David Ellison’s hands. During the last quarter of 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery reviewed bids to sell its holdings. It accepted Netflix’s offer, but Paramount has continued to put pressure on the company to accepts its bid. However the bidding war plays out, any deal will result in layoffs, although the timing could stretch into 2027. As Hollywood continues to lose out on productions to the U.K. due to incentives overseas and the rising cost of shooting in Los Angeles, the industry has also taken a hit. Some of the major job cuts to hit Hollywood this year included: Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal are each planning to spinoff their cable linear assets next year. With Comcast’s creation of Versant, NBCU laid off 7% of the workforce at NBC News and more employees from the television sector of the business, with Versant trading at the beginning of 2026. Under the leadership of Gunnar Wiedenfels, Warner Bros. will house its traditional TV networks under the independent “Global Networks” company. This split will go into effect later in 2026 under the accepted Netflix bid. Paramount is still pursuing the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, and said it expects to wring out $6 billion in merger-cost savings over the next three years. Analysts predicted at least 6,000 job losses, echoing Disney’s 2019 Fox acquisition downsizing. On-location production in the greater Los Angeles area, meanwhile, declined 13.2% from July through September compared to the same period last year, according to FilmLA. Only 157 theatrical films, television shows and movies, and streaming projects shot in Los Angeles County were completed and released in 2024. That’s down 14% from the 183 projects recorded in 2023 and the 228 recorded in 2022 amidst the production backlog caused by COVID. While Hollywood remains the leader in global film and TV production, the gap continues to steadily narrow while an estimated 41,000 entertainment jobs in Los Angeles have been lost over the past five years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “There are far fewer film projects being made in Los Angeles than there were in the recent past,” FilmLA Vice President of Communications Philip Sokoloski said. “Expanded options for attracting and retaining film jobs – as enacted this past July — are not only good for California’s economy, they are a critical form of protection for working families.” With the impending threat and continued implementation of AI in the newsroom, media companies have made tough decisions to best fit their financial needs and maintain relevancy. Several news organizations took hits as they pivot to keep up with audiences shortening attention spans and growing content sources. The cuts came amid a broader wave of layoffs throughout 2025. CBS News laid off about 100 people in October, weeks after NBC News laid off roughly 150 people. Condé Nast also cut multiple staffers last month through layoffs at Teen Vogue and the firings of four staffers who protested the cuts. Penske staffers suffered a wave of cuts at Variety, Rolling Stone and Billboard just weeks before the holidays. The layoffs at PMC organizations also come after the company removed work-from-home employment as an option, instituting in-office mandates and forced resignations in October for those who would not comply. There was a distinct rise in AI-driven layoffs this year, with the technology accounting for nearly 55,000 job cuts, according to data from Challenger. Since its introduction, AI has offered to replace workers and perform the jobs of many at a lower cost, vastly changing how employers value their employees and how secure workers feel in their roles. Amazon laid off 14,000 employees in October. CEO Andy Jassy claimed the cuts were not necessarily driven by financial or AI factors though the company’s initial memo to staffers said the company needed to meet “this generation of AI.” Microsoft similarly cut 15,000 jobs throughout the year, providing a variety of explanations for the cuts. Both companies have invested heavily in AI tools. AI’s integration into the newsroom has not been seamless for all — see the Washington Post’s AI-generated news podcast — but media organizations are leaning into the technology as a tool to keep up and compete. New York became the first state to require employers to disclose when AI is the reason for layoffs this year as more companies seek the technology out as a way to increase work efficiency and potentially cut entry level roles. “Currently, AI aids news workers rather than replaces them, but there are no guarantees this will remain the case,” a report from Columbia University’s journalism school said earlier this year. “AI is sufficiently mature to enable the replacement of at least some journalism jobs, either directly or because fewer workers are needed.”

Title: Crypto Predictions for 2026: Top Analysts’ View

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Top crypto firms reveal their 2026 forecasts: BTC ATHs, stablecoin dominance, and tokenized assets take center stage as speculation gives way to real-world infrastructure. 2025 has been a wild ride for everyone who expected BTC $87 881 24h volatility: 0.0% Market cap: $1.75 T Vol. 24h: $27.93 B and major altcoins to hit new highs. We’re 3 days away from the New Year, volatility is still insane, the Fear and Greed index has been extreme for dozens of days, and most significant cryptocurrencies are trading well below their ATHs. However, prominent crypto moguls are slightly optimistic about 2026. We gathered the most significant predictions in one post, and yes, we want to come back here next December and find out if this time they were true. BlackRock’s 2026 outlook frames digital assets, especially stablecoins, as financial infrastructure for payments, settlement, and liquidity, rather than a pure speculative trade. The firm highlights the maturing role of dollar-pegged tokens in cross-border transfers and treasury flows. It argues that crypto’s most durable growth now sits beneath the surface in rails that interoperate with traditional finance. “Stablecoins are no longer niche — they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” says Samara Cohen, Global Head of Market Development at BlackRock. Grayscale’s annual outlook calls for Bitcoin to set a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. A DCG-owned investment group believes the Bitcoin price will be driven by clearer U.S. policy, rising institutional demand, and the fading dominance of the simple four-year halving cycle as macro liquidity and regulation take the wheel. The firm expects “rising valuations in 2026,” with institutions increasingly treating BTC as an allocatable portfolio asset. Grayscale’s 2026 Digital Asset Outlook is here with 10 themes marking the "Dawn of the Institutional Era." Our last 3 themes dive into what’s shaping crypto’s next phase in 2026. From Grayscale — the world’s largest digital asset-focused investment platform¹. Click below ⬇️ — Grayscale (@Grayscale) December 22, 2025 In its report, Coinbase Institutional says market structure, not narratives, will define 2026. The major crypto exchange expects the activity to concentrate on: Perpetual futures will anchor price discovery and command most trading volume. Leverage reset in late-2025 is seen as structural, not a retreat. Prediction markets will become a credible venue for information and risk transfer. It is worth noting that Coinbase plans its own push into the category. Stablecoins and payments will become crypto’s most persistent real-world use case. Coinbase models the stablecoin market cap at approximately $1.2 trillion by 2028. In its paper titled “26 Crypto, Bitcoin, DeFi, and AI Predictions for 2026“, Galaxy, same as BlackRock, focused on the real-world use cases. Stablecoins are forecast to process more volume than U.S. ACH and become core payment plumbing. Tokenized assets are expected to enter mainstream collateral and capital markets. Public chains will rethink value capture, with at least one L1 likely enshrining a revenue-generating app to feed its native token. In the meantime, the company thinks it’s too hard to predict the Bitcoin price, but it still sticks to its $250,000 forecast by the end of 2027. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest maintains a multi-year, institution-led BTC adoption thesis. They’ve maintained their 2030 scenario up to $2.4 million in the bull case and stepped up buying of crypto-exposed equities into year-end 2025. In a recent video for investors, Wood even says 2026 will be a Goldilocks year due to 0% inflation. Cathie Wood predicts 0% inflation by 2026 She says 2026 could be a Goldilocks year. After tariffs, shutdown risk, and hawkish Fed rhetoric, the market may be underestimating how close inflation could get to zero if oil and rents keep falling. pic.twitter.com/YeNlrsrlIr — Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 21, 2025 Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trading lower as we begin the final trading week of 2025, albeit a holiday-shortened one once again. The major indices all finished the session modestly lower on Friday, with the venerable S&P 500 taking early bows as it hit a fresh all-time high, joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, which recently entered all-time high territory. With just two full trading days left in the year, you can expect some volatility this week as investors and traders make final portfolio adjustments to close out the year. With sellers sneaking in late Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial closed at 48,710, down 0.04%, while the aforementioned S&P 500 backed off its intra-day all-time high print to close at 6.929 down 0.03%. The Nasdaq finished the day at 21,593, down 0.09%. Yields were flat to moderately lower on Friday as portfolio shuffling and some light profit-taking seemed to be the order for the day. The strong GDP data have challenged expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts next year, supporting a more hawkish stance among some Fed officials. Market pricing currently implies up to two rate cuts in 2026, while the median policymaker projection points to only one. Goldman Sachs said in the fall that it expects two more 25-basis-point reductions in 2026. The 30-year long bond closed Friday at 4.82% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.13%. Both major oil benchmarks closed lower on Friday, with analysts pointing to the usual thin post-holiday trading as concerns about a looming global supply glut outweigh geopolitical supply risks, despite recent disruptions from actions against Venezuela and the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Brent Crude closed the day at $60.87, down 2.2%, while West Texas Intermediate finished Friday’s session at $56.94, down 2.2%. The big winner on Friday was Natural Gas, which had taken a beating over the previous two weeks, as it surged 3.5% higher to close at $4.39. Analysts cited cold weather, high LNG exports, and tighter storage levels, which are expected to drive winter demand upward despite warmer spells. Plus, short covering after a 20%+ move down was a possible reason for the gains. Gold continued to race higher after smashing through the $4500 mark earlier in the week, to finish Friday at $4,494. More positive coverage at Goldman Sachs, which sees the precious metal hitting $4,900 in 2026 and says “Gold remains our single favorite long commodity,” was a factor in Friday’s move higher. Silver also continued on a moonshot parabolic move, closing Friday at $75.98. Both remain at all-time highs, and investors could see additional substantial gains as we head into 2026. The crypto market saw another day of high volatility and generally mixed to lower trading on Friday, with major assets like Bitcoin initially rising modestly before sliding later in the day due to the typical thin holiday liquidity and a surge in precious metals pricing that drew significant investor capital in end-of-year moves. At 8 a.m. EST on Monday, Bitcoin was quoted at $87,580, while Ethereum was seen at $2,962. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Time Published: 2025-12-29T08:00:00Z

This year-in-review episode features an exceptional panel of Python luminaries representing diverse perspectives across education, industry, and core Python development: Gregory Kapfhammer is an Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science who conducts research in software engineering and software testing. He has built numerous Python tools, with current research focusing on flaky test cases in Python projects. Gregory also hosts the Software Engineering Radio podcast sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, where he has interviewed many members of the Python community. Thomas Wouters is a longtime Python core developer who worked at Google for 17 years before joining Meta. He has served multiple terms on the PSF Board and the Python Steering Council. In 2025, Thomas received the PSF Distinguished Service Award recognizing his extensive contributions to Python. Jodie Burchell is a Data Scientist and Developer Advocate at JetBrains, working on PyCharm. She has been a data scientist for around 10 years after transitioning from a career as a clinical psychologist. Jodie has been working with NLP and LLMs since before they became mainstream, including early Google language models from 2019. Brett Cannon has been at Microsoft for 10 years and is currently working on AI R&D for Python developers. He also maintains WASI support for Python and does internal consulting. Despite being a core developer for 22 years, Brett jokes that he is the "shortest-running" core developer on this panel. He previously managed the Python experience in VS Code. Reuven Lerner is a freelance Python and Pandas trainer who celebrated 30 years of freelancing in 2024. He teaches Python and Pandas both at companies and through his online platform, writes newsletters, publishes books, and speaks at conferences. Barry Warsaw has been a Python core developer since 1994, making him the longest-tenured developer on the panel. He worked with Guido van Rossum at CNRI in Python's early days, handling mailing lists, version control, and websites. Barry created the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) process 25 years ago. He is currently at NVIDIA doing Python work split between internal projects and external open-source community contributions, and serves on the Steering Council. If you are newer to Python and want to get the most out of this episode analysis, here are some foundational concepts that will help: The most transformative development in Python for 2025 is the advancement of free-threaded Python, which removes the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Thomas Wouters, who championed this effort, confirmed that free threading has moved from experimental to officially supported status in Python 3.14. The performance overhead is remarkably small - basically the same speed on macOS (due to ARM hardware and Clang optimizations) and only a few percent slower on Linux with recent GCC versions. The main challenge now is community adoption: getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for the new APIs. Barry Warsaw called this "one of the most transformative developments for Python, certainly since Python 3." Early experiments show promising results, with highly parallel workloads seeing 10x or greater speedups. The PyTorch data loader, for example, has seen massive improvements by leveraging multiple threads. Jodie Burchell provided a grounded perspective on AI in 2025, noting that GPT-5's release in August marked a turning point where mainstream observers began questioning the AI bubble. The "scaling laws" that promised exponential improvements turned out not to be laws at all, and OpenAI's internal struggles to deliver on AGI promises became public. Investment in AI spending now exceeds consumer spending in the US, which Jodie called "a really scary prospect." Despite the bubble concerns, the panel universally agreed that LLMs are incredibly useful tools that are here to stay. Gregory Kapfhammer shared that automated refactoring, test generation, and code coverage improvement - goals he thought would never be achieved in his lifetime - are now routine with tools like Claude Code. The consensus: even if models never improve beyond current capabilities, they represent a massive leap beyond previous development tools. Barry Warsaw noted he no longer searches for documentation - he just asks the AI to set things up. Brett Cannon highlighted a fundamental shift in how Python developers work: tools like uv, Hatch, and PDM now treat Python itself as an implementation detail. Instead of the traditional workflow of installing Python, creating a virtual environment, and managing dependencies, developers can now simply run a command like uv run and everything is handled automatically. This represents a "renewed focus on user experience" according to Barry Warsaw. The distance between having an idea and having working code has dramatically narrowed. Combined with PEP 723 (inline script metadata), you can now put uv in the shebang line of a Python script and share it without any setup instructions - the script carries its own dependency information. Gregory Kapfhammer shared that he now starts undergraduate students with uv on the first day of class, eliminating the week-long setup struggles that used to plague even strong students. Gregory Kapfhammer declared 2025 "the year of type checking and language server protocols," highlighting the emergence of three new Rust-based type checkers: Pyrefly from Meta, ty from Astral, and Zubon from David Halter (creator of Jedi). These tools have transformed what previously took tens or hundreds of seconds into sub-second operations. The speed improvements fundamentally change how developers interact with type checking - it becomes a real-time feedback loop rather than a batch process. However, Gregory noted a challenge: different type checkers can disagree on whether code has errors, even on the same codebase. His research team built a tool that automatically generates Python programs causing type checkers to disagree with each other. The PyLands team at Microsoft is working with the Pyrefly team to define a Type Server Protocol (TSP) that would let type checkers feed information to higher-level LSPs. Reuven Lerner raised concerns about Python's funding sustainability. The PSF had to pause its grants program and turned down an NSF government grant due to attached DEI restrictions that conflicted with PSF values. Most Python users have no idea the language needs funding - they just know they can download it for free. Thomas Wouters pointed out that major AI companies, despite relying entirely on PyPI and Python infrastructure, have done "basically no sponsorship of the PSF." The amounts needed are surprisingly small - less than what a medium company spends on expensed meal tips annually, or less than a Silicon Valley developer's salary. All panelists' employers (Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA, JetBrains) are PSF sponsors, but many companies using Python are not. Reuven noted that NumFocus has about twice the PSF's budget, suggesting it is possible to get corporate sponsorship for Python-related projects. Thomas Wouters mentioned lazy imports as his "second favorite child" topic - a PEP that was accepted in 2025 and will significantly improve Python startup time and import performance. This feature defers the actual importing of modules until they are first used, rather than loading everything at startup. The lazy imports PEP (810) had broad community support despite some very vocal opposition. Pablo Galindo, a Steering Council member, led the effort and bore the brunt of criticism despite the technical merits being clear. This feature will be especially impactful for applications with many imports that may not all be needed for every code path. Barry Warsaw, who created the PEP process 25 years ago, acknowledged that authoring PEPs has become "incredibly difficult and emotionally draining." The community has grown exponentially, but discussions on discuss.python.org can become toxic. PEP authors regularly receive vitriol in their personal inboxes for proposing technical changes. The Steering Council itself exists because Guido van Rossum received such abuse over PEP 572 (the walrus operator) that he stepped down as BDFL. Thomas shared that Pablo Galindo received "ridiculous accusations" in his mailbox simply for proposing lazy imports. Core developers sometimes skip the PEP process entirely to avoid this gauntlet, which is also problematic because important changes don't get properly documented or discussed. Barry believes Python needs to rethink how it evolves the language while not losing the voice of users. With free threading joining asyncio, multiprocessing, and subinterpreters, Python now has multiple concurrency approaches. Reuven asked how developers should choose between them. Thomas explained that most end users should not need to make these low-level choices - higher-level abstractions should handle it. Brett suggested using concurrent.futures as a unified interface where you start with threads (fastest), fall back to subinterpreters if needed, then to process pools. Michael Kennedy expressed hope that Python's concurrency could eventually solidify around async/await with decorators indicating the execution mode, hiding the complexity from developers. The key insight is that different problems benefit from different approaches, and libraries like PyTorch are already combining techniques (using threads for data loading within an async framework) to achieve massive speedups. Gregory Kapfhammer gave a shout-out to regional Python conferences, specifically highlighting PyOhio as a free conference that anyone can attend with no registration fee, hosted at universities like Ohio State and Cleveland State. These local events provide accessible entry points to the Python community. Reuven shared a contrasting experience attending a non-Python conference where all speakers were from advertisers and sponsors, and people were not interested in sharing. He called Python conferences "really special" for the combination of career benefits and genuine community connection. The community aspect remains one of Python's greatest strengths. A Stanford study (the "10K Developer Study") examining real codebases found nuanced results about AI coding assistants. Yes, there are productivity boosts, but AI produces more code that tends to be worse than human-written code and introduces more bugs. When accounting for refactoring and debugging time, developers are still more productive overall. AI works better for greenfield projects, smaller codebases, simpler problems, and more popular languages (more training data). Jodie emphasized that like an IDE, AI is a tool - not a replacement. Barry's favorite use is bypassing documentation: instead of searching docs, he asks the AI to set things up. Gregory noted that AI agents work much better when given fast feedback tools like type checkers and linters. Thomas emphasized the importance of new people joining Python - as triagers, drive-by commenters, or eventually core developers. Python is what the community makes it, with no company dictating direction. Barry encouraged anyone interested in becoming a core developer to find a mentor, and anyone wanting to be involved with the PSF to reach out. Thomas pointed out he is a high school dropout who never went to college, while Brett has a PhD - neither credential is required to contribute meaningfully to Python. The call to action: run for the Steering Council (they need more candidates), sponsor the PSF if your company uses Python, and engage with the community in whatever way fits your skills and interests. "Python in 2025 is a delightfully refreshing place. The GIL's days are numbered, packaging is getting sharper tools, and the type checkers are multiplying like gremlins snacking after midnight." -- Michael Kennedy "I can remember thinking to myself how cool would it be if I had a system that could automatically refactor and then add test cases and increase the code coverage and make sure all my checkers and linters pass... I remember thinking five to seven years ago I would never realize that goal in my entire lifetime. And now when I use Anthropic's models through Claude Code, it's incredible how much you can achieve so quickly." -- Gregory Kapfhammer "I'm glad I'll never have to write bash from scratch ever again." -- Brett Cannon on AI assistance "I never even search for the docs. I never even try to read the docs anymore. I just say, hey, I need to set up this website. And I just tell me what to do or just do it. And it's an immense time saver." -- Barry Warsaw "The GIL never gave you thread safety. The GIL gave CPython's internals thread safety. It never really affected Python code." -- Thomas Wouters "Free threading is absolutely the future of Python, and I think it's going to unlock incredible potential and performance." -- Barry Warsaw "It's ridiculous how small those sponsorships are and yet how grateful we were that they came in because every single one has such a big impact." -- Thomas Wouters on PSF funding "What the PSF would be happy with is less than a medium company spends on the tips of expensed meals every year." -- Thomas Wouters, quoting Ned Batchelder "I don't want to call on people in the community to do it because they're probably the same people who are also donating their time for Python. It's just squeezing people who give so much of themselves to this community even more." -- Jodie Burchell on funding burnout "Python is the community or the community is Python. There's no company that is telling anybody what Python should be. Python is what we make it." -- Barry Warsaw "I'm a high school dropout and I never went to college or anything. And look at me." -- Thomas Wouters on qualifications needed for Python contribution GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): A mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. Its removal in free-threaded Python enables true parallel execution of Python code across multiple CPU cores. Free-Threaded Python: A build of Python without the GIL, allowing multiple threads to execute Python bytecode simultaneously. Officially supported in Python 3.14. PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal): The formal process for proposing major changes to Python. Created by Barry Warsaw 25 years ago, PEPs document design decisions and the rationale behind language features. LSP (Language Server Protocol): A protocol for communication between code editors and language-specific tools that provide features like autocomplete, go-to-definition, and error checking. Type Checker: A tool that analyzes Python code with type hints to catch type-related errors before runtime. Examples include mypy, Pyrefly, ty, and Pyright. Lazy Imports: A feature (PEP 810) where module imports are deferred until the imported names are actually used, improving startup time for applications with many imports. PyPI (Python Package Index): The official repository for Python packages, run by the PSF and used by millions of developers daily. Steering Council: A five-person elected body that provides leadership for Python's development, created after Guido van Rossum stepped down as BDFL in 2018. PEP 723: Inline script metadata that allows Python scripts to declare their dependencies and Python version requirements directly in the file, enabling tools like uv to automatically set up the correct environment. Subinterpreters: Isolated Python interpreters running in separate threads within the same process, providing parallelism with stronger isolation than threads but less overhead than multiprocessing. For those looking to deepen their understanding of topics covered in this episode, here are relevant courses from Talk Python Training: Rock Solid Python with Python Typing: Learn the ins-and-outs of Python typing, explore frameworks using types like Pydantic and FastAPI, and get guidance for using types effectively in your applications. Async Techniques and Examples in Python: Master the entire spectrum of Python's parallel APIs including async/await, asyncio, threads, multiprocessing, and coordination techniques. LLM Building Blocks for Python: Learn to integrate large language models into Python applications with structured outputs, chat workflows, and production-ready async pipelines. Getting Started with pytest: Master pytest's five superpowers - simple test functions, fixtures, parametrization, markers, and plugins. Python for Absolute Beginners: Start from the very beginning with CS 101 concepts before building increasingly complex Python applications. Modern Python Projects: Learn project structure, dependency management, testing, documentation, CI/CD, and deployment for real-world Python applications. Python in 2025 stands at an inflection point where decades of foundational work are paying off in transformative ways. The removal of the GIL promises to unlock true parallelism, modern tooling like uv is abstracting away complexity that once frustrated beginners, and Rust-based type checkers are making static analysis feel instantaneous. Yet beneath these technical victories lies a community wrestling with sustainability - funding challenges, contributor burnout, and the difficulty of evolving a language used by millions through a 25-year-old proposal process. What shines through this conversation is that Python's greatest asset has always been its people. From Barry Warsaw, who has been contributing since 1994 and created the very PEP process he now seeks to reform, to Jodie Burchell, a relative newcomer who marveled at how welcoming the community has been, the panel represents a continuum of experience united by shared values. The call to action is clear: sponsor the PSF if your company uses Python, contribute in whatever way fits your skills, attend regional conferences, and remember that Python is not a product controlled by any corporation - it is what we collectively make it. The future is being built right now by people who simply showed up and got involved. 00:00 Python in 2025 is a delightfully refreshing place. 00:04 The guild's days are numbered, packaging is getting sharper tools, 00:07 and the type checkers are multiplying like gremlins snacking after midnight. 00:11 On this episode, we have an amazing panel to give us a range of perspectives 00:15 on what mattered in 2025 in Python. 00:19 We have Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Gregory Kampfhammer, Jody Burchell, Reuven Lerner, 00:24 and Thomas Worders on the show to give us their thoughts. 00:28 This is Talk Python To Me, episode 532, recorded December 9th, 2025. 00:50 Welcome to Talk Python To Me, the number one Python podcast for developers and data scientists. 00:55 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 00:57 I'm a PSF fellow who's been coding for over 25 years. 01:01 Let's connect on social media. 01:03 You'll find me and Talk Python on Mastodon, BlueSky, and X. 01:06 The social links are all in your show notes. 01:09 You can find over 10 years of past episodes at talkpython.fm. 01:12 And if you want to be part of the show, you can join our recording live streams. 01:16 That's right. 01:17 We live stream the raw uncut version of each episode on YouTube. 01:20 Just visit talkpython.fm/youtube to see the schedule of upcoming events. 01:25 Be sure to subscribe there and press the bell so you'll get notified anytime we're recording. 01:29 Look into the future and see bugs before they make it to production. 01:33 Sentry's SEER AI code review uses historical error and performance information at Sentry 01:39 to find and flag bugs in your PRs before you even start to review them. 01:43 Stop bugs before they enter your code base. 01:46 Get started at talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 01:50 Hey, before we jump into the interview, I just want to send a little message to all the companies out there with products and services trying to reach developers. 01:59 That is the listeners of this show. 02:01 As we're rolling into 2026, I have a bunch of spots open. 02:05 So please reach out to me if you're looking to sponsor a podcast or just generally sponsor things in the community. 02:12 And you haven't necessarily considered podcasts. 02:14 You really should reach out to me and I'll help you connect with the Talk Python audience. 02:20 thanks everyone for listening all of 2025 and here we go into 2026 cheers hey everyone it's so 02:27 awesome to be here with you all thanks for taking the time out of your day to be part of talk python 02:31 for this year in review this python year in review so yeah let's just jump right into it gregory 02:38 welcome welcome to the show welcome back to the show how you doing hi i'm an associate professor 02:42 of computer and information science and i do research and software engineering and software 02:46 testing. I've built a bunch of Python tools, and one of the areas we're studying now is flaky test 02:51 cases in Python projects. I'm also really excited about teaching in a wide variety of areas. In fact, 02:57 I use Python for operating systems classes or theory of computation classes. And one of the 03:02 things I'm excited about is being a podcast host. I'm also a host on the Software Engineering Radio 03:08 podcast sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, and I've had the cool opportunity to interview a 03:14 whole bunch of people in the Python community. So Michael, thanks for welcoming me to the show. 03:18 Yeah, it's awesome to have you back. And we talked about FlakyTest last time. I do have to say 03:23 your AV setup is quite good. I love the new mic and all that. Thomas, welcome. Awesome to have 03:29 you here. Thanks for having me. I'm Thomas Wauters. I'm a longtime Python core developer, 03:34 although not as long as one of the other guests on this podcast. I worked at Google for 17 years. 03:40 for the last year or so I've worked at Meta. In both cases, I work on Python itself within the 03:45 company and just deploying it internally. I've also been a board member of the PSF, although I'm not 03:51 one right now. And I've been a steering council member for five years and currently not because 03:58 the elections are going and I don't know what the result is going to be. But I think there's like 04:02 five, six chance that I'll be on the steering council since we only have six candidates for 04:09 five positions when this episode probably airs. I don't know. That's quite the contribution to the 04:14 whole community. Thank you. I always forget this. I also got the, what is it, the Distinguished 04:19 Service Award from the PSF this year. I should probably mention that. So yes, I have been 04:24 recognized. No need to talk about it further. Wonderful. Wonderful. Jody, welcome back on the 04:29 show. Awesome to catch up with you. Yeah, thanks for having me back. I am a data scientist and 04:34 developer advocate at JetBrains working on PyCharm. And I've been a data scientist for around 10 04:39 years. And prior to that, I was actually a clinical psychologist. So that was my training, 04:45 my PhD, but abandoned academia for greener pastures. Let's put it that way. 04:50 Noah Franz-Gurig. 04:53 Brett, hello. Good to see you. 04:55 Hello. Yes. Yeah, let's see here. I've been at Microsoft for 10 years. I started doing, 05:00 working on AI R&D for Python developers. 05:03 Also keep Wazzy running for Python here and do a lot of internal consulting for teams outside. 05:09 I am actually the shortest running core developer on this call, amazingly, 05:14 even though I've been doing it for 22 years. 05:16 I've also only gotten the Frank Wilson award, not the DSA. 05:19 So I feel very under accomplished here as a core developer. 05:22 Yeah, that's me in a nutshell. 05:24 Otherwise, I'm still trying to catch that. 05:26 Most quoted. 05:27 Yeah, most quoted. 05:29 I will say actually at work, it is in my email footer that I'm a famous Python quotationist. 05:33 That was Anthony Shaw's suggestion, by the way. 05:35 That was not mine, but does link to the April Fool's joke from last year. 05:39 And I am still trying to catch Anthony Shaw, I think, on appearances on this podcast. 05:43 Well, plus one. 05:44 Anthony Shaw should be here, honestly. 05:46 I mean, I put it out into Discord. 05:48 He could have been here, but probably at an odd time. 05:51 You used to work on VS Code a bunch on the Python aspect of VS Code. 05:54 You recently changed roles, right? 05:57 Not recently. 05:57 That was, I used to be the dev manager. 05:59 Every seven years, years ago. 06:01 Yeah, September of 2024. 06:03 So it's been over a year. 06:04 But yeah, I used to be the dev manager. 06:04 That counts as recent for me. 06:06 Yes, I used to be the dev manager for the Python experience in VS Code. 06:09 Okay, very cool. 06:10 That's quite a shift. 06:11 Yeah, it went back to being an IC basically. 06:13 You got all, you're good at your TPS reports again now? 06:17 Actually, I just did do my connect, so I kind of did. 06:19 Awesome. 06:20 Reuven, I bet you haven't filed a TPS report in at least a year. 06:23 So yeah, I'm Reuven. 06:24 I'm a freelance Python and Pandas trainer. 06:28 I just celebrated this past week 30 years since going freelance. 06:32 So I guess it's working out okay. 06:35 We'll know at some point if I need to get a real job. 06:38 I teach Python Pandas both at companies and on my online platform. 06:41 I have newsletters. 06:42 I've written books, speaking conferences, and generally try to help people improve their 06:47 Python and Pandas fluency and confidence and have a lot of fun with this community as well 06:51 as with the language. 06:52 Oh, good to have you here. 06:53 Barry, it's great to have a musician on the show. 06:56 Thanks. 06:58 Yeah, I've got my bases over here. 07:00 So, you know, if you need to be serenaded. 07:02 Yeah, like a Zen of Python may break out at any moment. 07:05 You never know when it's going to happen. 07:07 Thanks for having me here. 07:08 Yeah, I've been a core developer for a long time, since 1994. 07:13 And I've been, you know, in the early days, I did tons of stuff for Python.org. 07:20 I worked with Guido at CNRI and we moved everything from the mailing, the Postmaster stuff, 07:27 and the version control systems back in the day, websites, all that kind of stuff. 07:32 I try to not do any of those things anymore. 07:35 There's way more competent people doing that stuff now. 07:39 I have been a release manager. 07:42 I'm currently back on the steering council and running again. 07:47 between Thomas and I, we'll see who makes it to six years, I guess. 07:52 And I'm currently working for NVIDIA, and I do all Python stuff. 07:58 Some half and half, roughly, of internal things and external open source community work, 08:05 both in packaging and in core Python. 08:08 That's, I guess, I think that's about it. 08:10 Yeah, you all are living in exciting tech spaces, that's for sure. 08:14 That's for sure. 08:15 For sure. 08:16 Yeah. Well, great to have you all back on the show. Let's start with our first topic. So the 08:20 idea is we've each picked at least a thing that we think stood out in 2025 in the Python space 08:27 that we can focus on. And let's go with Jody first. I'm excited to hear what you thought was 08:33 one of the bigger things. I'm going to mention AI. Like, wow, what a big surprise. So to kind of 08:40 give context of where I'm coming from, I've been working in NLP for a long time. I like to say I was 08:45 working on LLMs before they were cool. So sort of playing around with the very first releases from 08:50 Google in like 2019, incorporating that into search. So I've been very interested sort of 08:56 seeing the unfolding of the GPT models as they've grown. And let's say slightly disgusted by the 09:03 discourse around the models as they become more mainstream, more sort of the talk about people's 09:09 jobs being replaced, a lot of the hysteria, a lot of the doomsday stuff. So I've been doing talks 09:15 and other content for around two and a half years now, just trying to cut through the hype a bit, 09:19 being like, you know, they're just language models, they're good for language tasks. Let's think about 09:23 realistically what they're about. And what was very interesting for me this year, I've been 09:29 incorrectly predicting the bubble bursting for about two and a half years. So I was quite vindicated 09:34 when in August, GPT-5 came out, and all of a sudden, everyone else started saying, 09:40 maybe this is a bubble. 09:41 Don't you think that was the first big release that was kind of a letdown compared to what the hype was? 09:47 Yeah, and it was really interesting. 09:48 So I found this really nice Atlantic article, and I didn't save it, unfortunately, 09:52 but essentially it told sort of the whole story of what was going on behind the scenes. 09:58 So GPT-4 came out in March of 2023, and that was the model that came out 10:03 with this Microsoft research paper saying, you know, sparks of AGI, artificial general intelligence, 10:08 blah, blah, blah. And from that point, there was really this big expectation sort of fueled by 10:15 OpenAI that GPT-5 was going to be the AGI model. And it turns out what was happening internally 10:22 is these scaling laws that were sort of considered, you know, this exponential growth thing that would 10:27 sort of push the power of these models perhaps towards human-like performance. They weren't 10:33 laws at all. And of course they started failing. So the model that they had originally pitched as 10:38 GPT-4 just didn't live up to performance. They started this post-training stuff where they were 10:43 going more into like specialized reasoning models. And what we have now are good models that are good 10:48 for specific tasks, but I don't know what happened, but eventually they had to put the GPT-5 label on 10:54 something. And yeah, let's say it didn't live up to expectations. So I think the cracks are starting 11:01 to show because the underlying expectation always was this will be improving to the point where 11:08 anything's possible and you can't put a price on that. But it turns out that if maybe there's a 11:14 limit on what's possible, yeah, you can put a price on it. And a lot of the valuations are on the 11:19 first part. Yes. And it's always been a bit interesting to me because I come from a scientific 11:24 background and you need to know how to measure stuff, right? And I'm like, what are you trying 11:28 to achieve? Like Gregory's nodding, like, please jump in. I'm on my monologue, so please don't 11:34 interrupt me. You really need to understand what you're actually trying to get these models to do. 11:38 What is AGI? No one knows this. And what's going to be possible with this? And it's more science 11:46 fiction than fact. So this for me has been the big news this year, and I'm feeling slightly smug, 11:51 I'm going to be honest, even though my predictions were off by about a year and a half. 11:55 Yeah, maybe it's not an exponential curve. 11:56 It's a titration S curve with an asymptote. 11:59 We'll see. 12:00 Yeah, sigmoid. 12:01 Yeah. 12:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 12:03 I mean, I think we have to sort of separate the technology from the business. 12:07 And the technology, even if it doesn't get any better, even if we stay with what we have today, 12:13 I still think this is like one of the most amazing technologies I've ever seen. 12:18 It's not a god. 12:19 It's not a panacea. 12:21 But it's like a chainsaw that if you know how to use it, it's really effective. 12:25 but in the hands of amateurs, you can really get hurt. And so, yes, it's great to see this sort of 12:32 thing happening and improving, but who knows where it's going to go. And I'm a little skeptical of 12:36 the AGI thing. What I'm a little more worried about is that these companies seem to have no 12:40 possible way of ever making the money that they're promising to their investors. And I do worry a lot 12:47 that we're sort of like a year 2000 situation where, yeah, the technology is fantastic, 12:53 But the businesses are unsustainable. And out of the ashes of what will happen, we will get some amazing technology and even better than we had before. But there are going to be ashes. 13:03 For me, that also makes me worry. And I don't know if anyone reads Ed Zitron here. He's a 13:09 journalist kind of digging into the state of the AI industry. He does get a bit sort of, 13:15 his reputation is a bit of a crank now. So I think he's leaned into that pretty hard, 13:20 but he does take the time to also pull out numbers and point out things that don't make sense. 13:25 And he was one of the first ones to sound the whistle on this circular funding we've been seeing. 13:30 So the worry, of course, is when a lot of this becomes borrowings from banks and then that starts dragging in funding from everyday people. 13:41 And also the effect that this has had on particularly the U.S. economy, like the stock market. 13:45 I think the investment in AI spending now exceeds consumer spending in the U.S., which is a really scary prospect. 13:54 That is crazy. 13:55 Mm-hmm. But yeah, also as Reven said, I love LLMs. They are the most powerful tools we've 14:02 ever had for natural language processing. It's phenomenal the problems we can solve with them 14:06 now. I didn't think this sort of stuff would be possible when I started in data science. 14:10 I still think there's a use case for agents, although I do think they've been a bit overstated, 14:16 especially now that I'm building them. Let's say it's not very fun building 14:20 non-deterministic software. It's quite frustrating, actually. But I hope we're going to see improvements 14:25 in the framework, particularly I've heard good things about Pydantic AI. And yeah, hopefully we 14:30 can control the input outputs and make them a bit more strict. This will fix a lot of the problems. 14:36 One thing I do want to put out in this conversation, I think is worth separating. And Reuven, 14:41 you touched on this some. I want to suggest to you, I'll throw this out to you all and see what 14:45 you think. I think it's very possible that this AI bubble crashes the economy and causes bad things 14:51 economically to happen and a bunch of companies that are like wrappers over open ai api go away 14:58 but i don't think things like the agentic coding tools will vanish they might stop training they 15:03 might slow their advance because that's super expensive but i even as if you said even if we 15:09 just had claude sonnet 4 and the world never got something else it would be so much far farther 15:16 beyond autocomplete and the other stuff that we had before and stack overflow that it's i don't 15:20 think it's going to go. The reason I'm throwing this out there is I was talking to somebody and 15:23 they were like, well, I don't think it's worth learning because I think the bubble is going to 15:26 pop. And so I don't want to learn this agent at coding because it won't be around very long. 15:30 What do you all think? It's here to stay. I think it's just, where's the limit? Where does it stop? 15:34 I think that's the big open question for everybody, right? Like pragmatically, it's a tool. It's useful 15:40 in some scenarios and not in others. And you just have to learn how to use the tool appropriately 15:44 for your use case and to get what you need out of it. And sometimes that's not using it because 15:47 it's just going to take up more time than it will to be productive. But other times it's 15:51 fully juices up your productivity and you can get more done. It's give and take. But I don't think 15:56 it's going to go anywhere because as you said, Michael, there's even academics doing research now. 16:00 There's open weight models as well. There's a lot of different ways to run this, whether you're 16:05 at the scale of the frontier models that are doing these huge trainings or you're doing something 16:11 local and more specialized. So I think the general use of AI isn't going anywhere. I think it's just 16:16 the question of how far can this current trend go and where will it be i want to say stop that's 16:22 because that plays into the whole it's never it's going to completely go away i don't think it ever 16:25 will i think it's just going to be where where are we going to start to potentially bump up against 16:29 limits one thing that i'll say is that many of these systems are almost to me like a dream come 16:33 true now admittedly it's the case that the systems i'm building are maybe only tens of thousands of 16:38 lines or hundreds of thousands of lines but i can remember thinking to myself how cool would it be 16:44 if I had a system that could automatically refactor 16:47 and then add test cases and increase the code coverage 16:51 and make sure all my checkers and linters pass and do that automatically and continue the process 16:57 until it achieved its goal. 16:59 And I remember thinking that five to seven years ago, 17:01 I would never realize that goal in my entire lifetime. 17:05 And now when I use like anthropics models through open code or Claude code, 17:10 it's incredible how much you can achieve so quickly, 17:13 even for systems that are of medium to moderate scale. 17:17 So from my vantage point, it is a really exciting tool. 17:20 It's incredibly powerful. 17:21 And what I have found is that the LLMs are much better 17:24 when I teach them how to use tools and the tools that it's using 17:29 are actually really quick, fast ones that can give rapid feedback to the LLM 17:34 and tell it whether it's moving in the right direction or not. 17:36 Yeah, there's an engineering angle to this. 17:39 It's not just Vibe Coding if you take the time to learn it. 17:42 There was actually a very interesting study. I don't think the study itself has been released. 17:48 I haven't found it yet, but I saw a talk on it by some guys at Stanford. So they call it the 10K 17:53 developer study. And basically what they were doing was studying real code bases, including, 17:59 I think 80% of them were actually private code bases and seeing the point where the team started 18:05 adopting AI. And so their findings are really interesting and nuanced. And I think they probably 18:10 intuitively align with what a lot of us have experienced with AI. So basically, yes, there 18:16 are productivity boosts, but it produces a lot of code, but the code tends to be worse than the code 18:21 you would write and also introduces more bugs. So when you account for the time that you spend 18:27 refactoring and debugging, you're still more productive. But then it also depends on the 18:32 type of project, as Gregory was saying. So it's better for greenfield projects, it's better for 18:36 smaller code bases. It's better for simpler problems and it's better for more popular languages because 18:41 obviously there's more training data. And so this was actually, I like this study so much. I'll 18:46 actually share it with you, Michael, if you want to put it in the show notes, but it shows that, 18:50 yeah, the picture is not that simple and all this conflicting information and conflicting experiences 18:54 people were having line up completely with this. So again, like I work at an IDE company, it's tools 19:00 for the job. It's not like your IDE will replace you. AI is not going to replace you. It's just 19:06 going to make you maybe more productive sometimes. 19:08 Yeah. 19:09 Wait, IDE, you work for me. 19:11 Right. 19:12 It's not about you. 19:13 But then I work for the IDE. 19:18 This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry. 19:22 Let me ask you a question. 19:24 What if you could see into the future? 19:26 We're talking about Sentry, of course. 19:28 So that means seeing potential errors, crashes, and bugs before they happen, before you even 19:33 accept them into your code base. 19:35 That's what Sentry's AI Sears Code Review offers. 19:39 You get error prediction based on real production history. 19:43 AI Sear Code Review flags the most impactful errors your PR is likely to introduce before merge 19:50 using your app's error and performance context, not just generic LLM pattern matching. 19:55 Sear will then jump in on new PRs with feedback and warning if it finds any potential issues. 20:01 Here's a real example. 20:03 On a new PR related to a search feature in a web app, we see a comment from seer bicenturybot in the PR. 20:11 And it says, potential bug, the process search results function, can enter an infinite recursion when a search query finds no matches. 20:19 As the recursive call lacks a return statement and a proper termination condition. 20:24 And Seer AI Code Review also provides additional details which you can expand for further information on the issue and suggested fixes. 20:32 And bam, just like that, Seer AI Code Review has stopped a bug in its tracks without any 20:37 devs in the loop. 20:38 A nasty infinite loop bug never made it into production. 20:42 Here's how you set it up. 20:43 You enable the GitHub Sentry integration on your Sentry account, enable Seer AI on your 20:49 Sentry account, and on GitHub, you install the Seer by Sentry app and connect it to your 20:53 repositories that you want it to validate. 20:55 So jump over to Sentry and set up Code Review for yourself. 20:59 Just visit talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 21:03 The link is in your podcast player show notes and on the episode page. 21:06 Thank you to Sentry for supporting Talk Python and me. 21:10 I mean, the other thing is a lot of people and a lot of the sort of when people talk about AI 21:15 and LLMs and so forth in context of coding, it's the LLM writing code for us. 21:20 And maybe because I'm not doing a lot of serious coding, 21:23 it's more instruction and so forth. 21:25 I use it as like a sparring or brainstorming partner So it does, you know, checking of my newsletters for language and for tech edits and just sort of exploring ideas. 21:37 And for that, maybe it's because I do everything in the last minute and I don't have other people around or I'm lazy or cheap and don't want to pay them. 21:43 But definitely the quality of my work has improved dramatically. 21:46 The quality of my understanding has improved, even if it never wrote a line of code for me. 21:50 Just getting that feedback on a regular automatic basis is really helpful. 21:54 Yeah, I totally agree with you. 21:55 All right. We don't want to spend too much time on this topic, even though I believe Jody has put her finger on what might be the biggest tidal wave of 2025. 22:06 But still, a quick parting thoughts. Anyone else? 22:08 I'm glad I'll never have the right bash from scratch ever again. 22:12 Tell me about it. 22:13 Yeah. 22:15 I'll just say from anecdotally, the thing that I love about it is when I need to do something 22:22 and I need to go through docs, online docs for whatever it is, you know, it might be 22:28 GitLab or some library that I want to use or something like that. 22:32 I never even search for the docs. 22:33 I never even try to read the docs anymore. 22:35 I just say, hey, you know, whatever model I need to set up this website. 22:41 And I just, just tell me what to do or just do it. 22:43 And it's an immense time saver and productivity. 22:47 And then it gets me bootstrapped to the place where now I can start to be creative. 22:52 I don't have to worry about just like digging through pages and pages and pages of docs to 22:57 figure out one little setting here or there. 23:00 That's an amazing time saver. 23:02 Yeah, that's a really good point. 23:03 Another thing that I have noticed, there might be many things for which I had a really good 23:07 mental model, but my brain can only store so much information. 23:10 So for example, I know lots about the abstract syntax tree for Python, but I forget that 23:16 sometimes. 23:16 And so it's really nice for me to be able to bring that back into my mind quickly with 23:21 an LLM. 23:22 And if it's generating code for me that's doing a type of AST parsing, I can tell whether 23:27 that's good code or not because I can refresh that mental model. 23:30 So in those situations, it's not only the docs, but it's something that I used to know 23:35 really well that I have forgotten some of. 23:37 And the LLM often is very powerful when it comes to refreshing my memory and helping me to get started and move more quickly. 23:44 All right. Out of time, I think. Let's move on to Brett. What do you got, Brett? 23:48 Well, I actually originally said we should talk about AI, but Jody had a way better pitch for it than I did because my internal pitch was a little bit AI. 23:56 Do I actually have to write a paragraph explaining why? Then Jody actually did write the paragraph. So she did a much better job than I did. 24:01 So the other topic I had was using tools to run your Python code. 24:06 And what I mean by that is traditionally, if you think about it, 24:10 you install the Python interpreter, right? 24:13 Hopefully you create a virtual environment, install your dependencies, 24:16 and you call the Python interpreter in your virtual environment to run your code. 24:19 Those are all the steps you went through to run stuff. 24:21 But now we've got tools that will compress all that into a run command, 24:25 just do it all for you. 24:26 And it seems like the community has shown a level of comfort with that, 24:31 that I'd say snuck up on me a little bit, but I would say that I think it's a good thing, right? 24:37 It's showing us, I'm going to say us, as the junior core developer here on this call, 24:43 as to, sorry to make you too feel old, but admittedly, Barry did write my letter of recommendation 24:48 to my master's program. 24:51 So what happened was like, yeah, we had Hatch and PDM, 24:55 poetry before that, and uv as of last year, all kind of come through 24:59 and all kind of build on each other and take ideas from each other 25:02 and kind of just slowly build up this kind of repertoire of tool approaches 25:06 that they all kind of have a baseline kind of, not synergy is the right word, 25:09 but share just kind of approach to certain things with their own twists and added takes on things. 25:15 But in general, this whole like, you know what, you can just tell us to run this code 25:19 and we will just run it, right? 25:20 Like inline script metadata coming in and help making that more of a thing. 25:24 Disclaimer, I was the PEP delegate for getting that in. 25:27 But I just think that's been a really awesome trend And I'm hoping we can kind of leverage that a bit. 25:34 Like I have personal plans that we don't need to go into here, 25:36 but like I'm hoping as a Python core team, we can kind of like help boost this stuff up a bit 25:41 and kind of help keep a good baseline for this for everyone. 25:43 Because I think it's shown that Python is still really good for beginners. 25:45 You just have to give them the tools to kind of hide some of the details 25:49 to not shoot yourself in the foot and still leads to a great outcome. 25:52 Yeah, 2025 might be the year that the Python tools stepped outside of Python. 25:56 Instead of being, you install Python and then use the tools. 26:00 You do the tool to get Python, right? 26:02 Like uv and PDM and others. 26:03 Yeah, and inverted the dependency graph in terms of just how you put yourself in, right? 26:08 I think the interesting thing is these tools treat Python as an implementation detail almost, right? 26:13 Like when you just say uv or hatch run or PDM run thing, 26:17 these tools don't make you have to think about the interpreter. 26:19 It's just a thing that they pull in to make your code run, right? 26:22 It's not even necessarily something you have to care about if you choose not to. 26:26 And it's an interesting shift in that perspective, at least for me. 26:30 But I've also been doing this for a long time. 26:31 I think you're really onto something. 26:33 And what I love at sort of a high level is this, I think there's a renewed focus on the user experience. 26:40 And like uv plus the PEP 723, the inline metadata, you know, you can put uv in the shebang line of your script. 26:49 And now you don't have to think about anything. 26:52 You get uv from somewhere, and then it takes care of everything. 26:57 And Hatch can work the same way, I think, for developers. 27:01 But this renewed focus on installing your Python executable, 27:08 you don't really have to think about, because those things are very complicated, 27:12 and people just want to hit the ground running. 27:14 And so if you think about the previous discussion about AI, 27:18 I just want things to work. 27:20 I know what I want to do. 27:22 I can see it. 27:23 I can see the vision of it. 27:24 And I just don't want to. 27:25 An analogy is like when I first learned Python and I came from C++ and all those languages. 27:32 And I thought, oh my gosh, just to get like, hello world, 27:35 I have to do a million little things that I shouldn't have to do. 27:39 Like create a main and get my braces right and get all my variables right and get my pound includes correct. 27:46 And now I don't have to think about any of that stuff. 27:49 And the thing that was eye-opening for me with Python was the distance between vision of what I wanted and working code just really narrowed. 28:00 And I think that as we are starting to think about tools and environments and how to bootstrap all this stuff, we're also now taking all that stuff away. 28:09 Because people honestly don't care. 28:11 I don't care about any of that stuff. 28:13 I just want to go from like, I woke up this morning and had a cool idea and I just wanted to get at work. 28:18 Or you wanted to share it so you could just share the script and you don't have to say, 28:22 here's your steps that you get started with. 28:24 Exactly. 28:25 Exactly. 28:26 I want to thank the two of you for, oh, sorry, sorry, go ahead. 28:28 I'm just going to say, like, for years teaching Python that how do we get it installed? 28:34 At first, it surprised me how difficult it was for people. 28:37 Because like, oh, come on, we just got Python. 28:39 Like, what's so hard about this? 28:40 But it turns out it's a really big barrier to entry for newcomers. 28:45 And I'm very happy that Jupyter Lite now has solved its problems with input. 28:49 And it's like huge. 28:50 But until now, I hadn't really thought about starting with uv because it's cross-platform. 28:57 And if I say to people in the first 10 minutes of class, install uv for your platform and 29:02 then say uv in it, your project, bam, you're done. 29:05 It just works. 29:06 And then it works cross-platform. 29:07 This is mind-blowing. 29:08 And I'm going to try this at some point. 29:10 Thank you. 29:10 I can comment on the mind-blowing part because now when I teach undergraduate students, we 29:14 start with uv in the very first class. And it is awesome. There were things that would take students, 29:20 even very strong students who've had lots of experience, it would still take them a week to 29:26 set everything up on their new laptop and get everything ready and to understand all the key 29:30 concepts and know where something is in their path. And now we just say, install uv for your 29:36 operating system and get running on your computer. And then, hey, you're ready to go. And I don't have 29:42 teach them about docker containers and i don't have to tell them how to install python with some 29:47 package manager all of those things just work and i think from a learning perspective whether you're 29:52 in a class or whether you're in a company or whether you're teaching yourself uv is absolutely 29:58 awesome i'm actually wondering whether i am the one who is newest to python here i taught myself 30:05 python in 2011 so i was like python 2.7 stage but it was my first programming language i was just 30:12 procrastinating during my PhD. And I was like, I should learn to program. So I just taught myself 30:18 Python. And I can tell you, you do not come from an engineering background. And you're like, 30:23 what is Python? What is Python doing? Why am I typing Python to execute this hello world? And 30:29 if you're kind of curious, you get down a rabbit hole before you even get to the point where you're 30:33 just focusing on learning the basics. And so it's exactly, I was going to say with Reuven, 30:39 And like whether you thought about it for teaching, because we're now debating for Humble Data, 30:43 which is a beginner's data science community that I'm part of, whether we switch to uv. 30:48 This was Chuck's idea because it does abstract away all these details. 30:52 The debate I have is, is it too magic? 30:55 This is kind of the problem because I also remember learning about things like virtual 30:59 environments, because again, this was my first programming language and being like, 31:02 oh, it's a very good idea. 31:04 This is best practices. 31:05 And it's also a debate we have in PyCharm, right? 31:08 Like how much do you magic away the fundamentals versus making people think a little bit, but 31:15 I'm not sure. 31:15 All right. 31:15 Like, would you even let somebody run without a virtual environment? 31:19 That's like, that's a take you, that's a stance you could take. 31:21 I used to when I first learned Python, because it was too complicated, but then I learned 31:27 better. 31:28 But yes. 31:29 The consideration here is like hiding the magic isn't like hiding the details and having 31:34 all this magic just work is great as long as it works. 31:38 And the question is, how is it going to break down and how are people going to know how to deal 31:43 when it breaks down, if you hide all the magic? And I think virtual envs were, or let's say before 31:49 we had virtual envs, installing packages was very much in the, you had to know all the details 31:54 because it was very likely going to break down in some way right before we had virtual envs, 32:00 because you would end up with weird conflicts or multiple copies of a package installed in 32:04 different parts of the system. When we got virtual ends, we sort of didn't have to worry about that 32:10 anymore because we were trained in that you can just blow away the virtual one and it just works. 32:14 And with uv, we're back into, this looks like a single installation. We don't know what's going 32:19 to go on, but we've learned, we as a community and also the people working on uv, we have learned 32:25 from those earlier mistakes or not, maybe not mistakes, but consequences of the design. 32:32 And they have created something that is, that appears to be very stable where it's unlikely 32:38 the magic will break. 32:39 And when the magic does break, it's obvious what the problem is or, or it automatically 32:44 fixes itself. 32:45 So like it's not reusing, broken, installations and that kind of thing. 32:50 So the risk now, as it turns out, I think as is proven by the community adopting uv so 32:57 fast and so willingly, I think it's acceptable. 33:00 Well, I think it's, yeah, I think it's proven itself. 33:02 It's clear that this is, it's worth the potential of discovering weird edge cases later, both 33:09 because it's probably low likelihood, but also the people behind uv Astral have proven that 33:16 they would jump in and fix those issues, right? 33:18 They would do anything they need to keep uv workable the same way. 33:23 And they have a focus that Python as a whole cannot have because they cater to fewer use 33:28 cases than Python as a whole needs to. 33:31 On the audience, Galano says, as an enterprise tech director in Python coder, I believe we 33:36 should hide the magic which empowers the regular employee to do simple things that make their 33:40 job easier. 33:41 Yeah. 33:41 This notion of abstractions, right, has always been there in computer science. 33:47 And, you know, we've used tools or languages or systems where we've tried to bring that 33:53 abstraction layer up so that we don't have to think about all these details, as I mentioned 33:58 before. The question is, that's always the happy path. And when I'm trying to teach somebody 34:04 something like, here's how to use this library or here's how to use this tool, I try to be very 34:09 opinionated to keep people on that happy path. Like, assume everything's going to work just right. 34:15 Here's how you just make you go down that path to get the thing done that you want. The question 34:19 really is when things go wrong, how narrow is that abstraction? And are you able, and even when 34:27 you're just curious, like what's really going on underneath the hood? Of course, that's not a really 34:31 good analogy today because cars are basically computers on wheels that you can't really 34:36 understand how they work. But back in your day. But back in my day, we were changing spark plugs, 34:42 you know, but and crank that window down. Exactly. So I think we always have to leave that 34:50 room for the curious and the bad path where when things go wrong or when you're just like, 34:56 you know what, I understand how this works, but I'm kind of curious about what's really going on. 35:01 How easy is it for me to dive in and get a little bit more of that background, you know, 35:07 a little bit more of that understanding of what's going on. I want the magic to decompose, 35:12 right like you should be able to explain the magic path via a more decomposed steps using the tool 35:17 all the way down to what the tools like to do behind the scenes just just to admit i the reason 35:21 i brought this up and i've been thinking about this a lot is i'm thinking of trying to get the python 35:26 launcher to do a bit more because one interesting thing we haven't really brought up here is we're 35:31 all seeing uv uv uv uv is a company there's always there's they might disappear and we haven't 35:36 de-risked ourselves from that. Now we do have Hatch, we do have PDM, but as I said, there's kind 35:41 of a baseline I think they all share that I think they would be probably okay if the Python launcher 35:45 just did because that's based on standards, right? Because that's the other thing that there's been 35:48 a lot of work that has led to this step, right? Like we've gotten way more packaging standards, 35:52 we've got PEP 723, like we mentioned. There's a lot of work that's come up to lead to this point 35:58 that all these tools can lean on to have them all have an equivalent outcome because it's expected 36:03 is how they should be. 36:05 And so I think it's something we need to consider of how do we make sure, 36:09 like, by the way, uv, I know the people, they're great. 36:12 I'm not trying to spares them or think they're going to go away, 36:14 but it is something we have to consider. 36:16 And I will also say, Jody, I do think about this for teaching 36:20 because I'm a dad now and I don't want my kid coming home 36:24 when they get old enough to learn Python and go, hey, dad, 36:26 why is getting Python code running so hard? 36:29 So I want to make sure that that never happens. 36:32 But they fall in love with it from the start. 36:34 I realized something for the 2026 year interview. 36:37 I have to bring a sign that says time for next topic because we got a bunch of topics and we're running low on time. 36:43 So, Thomas, let's jump over to yours. 36:46 Oh, and I had two topics as well. 36:48 So I'm only going to have to pick my favorite child, right? 36:52 That's terrible. 36:53 My second favorite child is Lazy Imports, which is a relatively new development. 36:58 So we'll probably not get to that. 37:00 And just accepted. 37:00 Yes, it's been accepted and it's going to be awesome. 37:03 So I'll just give that a shout out and then move to my favorite child, which is free threaded 37:06 Python. 37:07 For those who were not aware, the global interpreter lock is going away. 37:12 I am stating it as a fact. 37:13 It's not actually a fact yet, but it, you know, that's because the steering council hasn't 37:18 realized the fact yet. 37:20 It is trending towards. 37:22 Well, I was originally on the steering council that accepted the proposal to add free threading 37:28 as a, as an experimental feature, we had this idea of adding it as experimental and then making it 37:34 supported, but not the default and then making it the default. And it was all a little vague and, 37:39 and up in the air. And then I didn't get reelected for the steering council last year, 37:44 which I was not sad about at all. I sort of ran on a, well, if there's nobody better, I'll do it, 37:49 but otherwise I have other things to do. And it turns out those other things were making sure that 37:54 prefer that Python landed in a supported state. So I lobbied the steering council quite hard, 38:00 as Barry might remember at the start of the year, to get some movement on this, like get some 38:04 decision going. So for Python 3.14, it is officially supported. The performance is great. It's like 38:10 between a couple of percent slower and 10% slower, depending on the hardware and the compiler that 38:16 you use. It's basically the same speed on macOS, which is really like it's, that's a combination of 38:23 the ARM hardware and Clang specializing things, but it's basically the same speed, which, wow. 38:29 And then on recent GCCs on Linux, it's like a couple of percent slower. The main problem is 38:35 really community adoption, getting third-party packages to update their extension modules for 38:40 the new APIs and the things that by necessity sort of broke, and also supporting free threading in a 38:48 in a good way and in packages for Python code, it turns out there's very few changes that 38:54 need to be made for things to work well under free threading. 38:57 They might not be entirely thread safe, but usually like almost always in cases where it 39:02 wasn't thread saved before either, because the guild doesn't actually affect thread safety. 39:07 Just the likelihood of things breaking. 39:09 I do think there's been a bit of a, the mindset of the Python community hasn't really been 39:14 focused on creating thread safe code because the GIL is supposed to protect us. 39:18 But soon as it takes multiple steps, then all of a sudden it's just less likely. 39:22 It's not that it couldn't happen. 39:23 Yeah, that's my point, right? 39:24 It's not the GIL never gave you threat safety. 39:27 The GIL gave cpythons internals threat safety. 39:31 It never really affected Python code and it very rarely affected thread safety in 39:36 extension modules as well. 39:37 So they already had to take care of, of making sure that the global interpreter 39:41 couldn't be released by something that they ended up calling indirectly so it's actually not that 39:46 hard to port most things to support free threading and the benefits we've seen some experimental 39:53 work because you know it's still it's still new there's still a lot of things that don't 39:56 quite support it there's still places where thread contention slows things things down a lot but 40:02 we've seen a lot of examples of really promising very parallel problems that now speed up by 10x or 40:09 more. And it's going to be really excited in the future. And it's in 2025 that this all started. 40:15 I mean, Sam started it earlier, but he's been working on this for years, but it landed in 2025. 40:21 It dropped its experimental stage in 314, basically. Yeah. I was going to say, were we all, 40:27 the three of us on the steering council at the same time when we decided to start the experiment 40:30 for free threading? I think Barry wasn't on it. Yeah, I missed a couple of years there, but I'm 40:36 Not sure. 40:36 No, I totally agree. 40:37 I think free threading is one of the most transformative developments for Python, certainly since Python 3, but even maybe more impactful because of the size of the community today. 40:49 Personally, you know, not necessarily speaking as a current or potentially former steering council member. 40:56 We'll see how that shakes out. 40:58 But I think it's inevitable. 41:00 I think free threading is absolutely the future of Python, and I think it's going to unlock incredible potential and performance. 41:08 I think we just have to do it right. 41:10 And so I talked to lots of teams who are building various software all over the community. 41:16 And I actually think it's more of an educational and maybe an outreach problem than it is a technological problem. 41:23 I mean, yes, there are probably APIs that are missing that will make people's lives easier. 41:30 There's probably some libraries that will make other code a little easier to write or whatever or to understand. 41:36 But like all that's solvable. 41:38 And I think really reaching out to the teams that are, you know, like Thomas said, 41:42 that are building the ecosystem, that are moving the ecosystem to a free threading world. 41:47 That's where we really need to spend our effort on. 41:50 And we'll get there. 41:51 It won't be that long. 41:52 It certainly won't be as long as it took us to get to Python 3. 41:56 I'm sort of curious as someone who's not super experienced with threading or, you know, basic concurrency. 42:04 I mean, I've used it, but I feel like now we have threads, especially with free threading and sub interpreters and multiprocessing and asyncio. 42:14 And I feel like for many people now it's like, oh, my God, which one am I supposed to use? 42:19 And for someone who's experienced, you can sort of say, well, this seems like a better choice. 42:24 But are there any plans to sort of try to have a taxonomy of what problems are solved by which of these? 42:31 The premise here is that everyone would be using one or more of these low-level techniques that you mentioned. 42:37 And I think that's not a good way of looking at it. 42:40 Like AsyncIO is a library that you want to use for the things that AsyncIO is good at. 42:46 And you can actually very nicely combine it with multiprocessing, with subprocesses, with 42:52 so that subprocesses and subinterpreters, just to make it clear that those are two very separate 42:57 things and multithreading, both with and without free threading. 43:01 And it solves different problems or it gives you different abilities within the AsyncIO 43:06 framework. 43:06 And the same is true for like GUI frameworks. 43:09 I mean, GUI frameworks usually want threads for multiple reasons, but you can use these 43:14 other things as well. 43:15 I don't think it's down to teaching end users when to use or avoid all these different things. 43:22 I think we need higher level abstractions for tasks that people want to solve. 43:27 And then those can decide on what for their particular use case is a better approach. 43:33 For instance, PyTorch has multiple. 43:36 So it's used for people who don't know to train, not just train, but it's used in AI 43:42 for generating large matrices and LLMs and what have you. 43:46 Part of it is loading data and processing. 43:49 And the basic ideas of AsyncIO are, oh, you can do all these things in parallel 43:55 because you're not waiting on the CPU, you're just waiting on IO. 43:58 Turns out it is still a good idea to use threads for massively parallel IO 44:02 because otherwise you end up waiting longer than you need to. 44:05 So a problem where we thought AsyncIO would be the solution 44:10 and we never needed threads is actually much improved if we tie in threads as well. 44:15 And we've seen massive, massive improvements in data loader. 44:19 There's even an article, a published article from some people at Meta 44:24 showing how much they improve the PyTorch data loader by using multiple threads. 44:29 But at a very low level, we don't want end users to need to make that choice, right? 44:33 I concur to futures is a good point, right? 44:35 Like all of these approaches are all supported there and it's a unified one. 44:39 So if you were to teach this, for instance, you could say use concurrent.tot futures. 44:42 These are all there. 44:44 This is the potential tradeoff. 44:45 Like basically use threads. 44:46 It's going to be the fastest unless there's like some module you have that's not that's 44:51 screwing up because of threads, then use sub interpreters. 44:53 And if for some reason sub interpreters don't work, you should move to the processing pool, 44:57 the process pool. 44:58 But I mean, basically, you just kind of just like, it's not go sort the fast stuff. 45:02 And for some reason, it doesn't work. 45:03 Use the next fastest and just kind of do it that way. 45:05 After that, then you start to the lower level. 45:08 Like, okay, why do I want to use subinterpreters instead of threads? 45:11 Those kinds of threads. 45:12 But I think that's a different, as I think we're all searching, 45:15 a different level of abstraction, which is a term we keep bringing up today. 45:19 It's a level that a lot of people are not going to have to care about. 45:21 I think the libraries are the ones that are going to have to care about this 45:23 and who are going to do a lot of this for you. 45:25 Let me throw this out on our way out the door to get to Reuven's topic. 45:29 I would love to see it solidify around async and await. 45:33 And you just await a thing, maybe put a decorator on something. 45:36 say this, this one, I want this to be threaded. I want this to be IO. I want this. And you don't, 45:42 you just use async and await and don't have to think about it, but that's, that's my dream. 45:46 Reuven, what's your dream? 45:48 Wow. How long do you have? 45:51 No, what's your topic? 45:52 So I want to talk about Python ecosystem and funding. When I talk to people with Python 45:59 and I talk to them about it, how it's open source, they're like, oh, right, it's open source. That 46:01 means I can download it for free. And from their perspective, that's sort of where it starts 46:05 and ends. And the notion that people work on it, the notion that needs funding, the notion that 46:10 there's a Python software foundation that supports a lot of these activities, the infrastructure 46:15 is completely unknown to them and even quite shocking for them to hear. But Python is in many 46:21 ways, I think, starting to become a victim of its own success, that we've been dependent on 46:27 companies for a number of years to support developers and development. And we've been 46:32 assuming that the PSF, which gives money out to lots of organizations to run conferences and 46:38 workshops and so forth, can sort of keep scaling up and that they will have enough funding. And 46:43 we've seen a few sort of shocks that system in the last year. Most recently, the PSF announced that 46:48 it was no longer going to be doing versus sort of pared down about a year ago, what it would give 46:52 money for. And then about five months ago, six months ago, I think it was in July or August, 46:56 they said, actually, we're not going to be able to fund anything for about a year now. 47:00 And then there was the government grant, I think from the NSF that they turned down. And I'm not disputing the reasons for that at all. It basically, it said, well, we'll give you the money if you don't worry about diversity and inclusion. And given that that's like a core part of what the PSF is supposed to do, they could not do that without shutting the doors, which would be kind of counterproductive. 47:17 And so I feel like we're not yet there, but we're sort of approaching this, I'm going to term like a problem crisis in funding Python. 47:27 The needs of the community keep growing and growing, whether it's workshops, whether it's PyPI, whether it's conferences. 47:32 And companies are getting squeezed. 47:35 And the number of people, it always shocks me every time there are PSF elections, the incredibly small number of people who vote. 47:42 Which means that, let's assume half the people who are members, third of the people. 47:46 Like for the millions and millions of people who program Python out there, an infinitesimally 47:50 small proportion of them actually join and help to fund it. 47:53 So I'm not quite sure what to do with this other than express concern. 47:57 But I feel like we've got to figure out ways to fund Python and the PSF in new ways that 48:01 will allow it to grow and scale as needed. 48:04 I couldn't agree more. 48:06 Obviously, the PSF is close to my heart because I was on the board for, I think, a total of 48:11 six or nine years or something over, you know, the last 25. 48:15 I was also for six months, I was the interim general manager because Eva left and we hadn't 48:21 hired Deb yet while I was on the board. 48:23 I remember signing the sponsor contracts for the companies that came in wanting to sponsor 48:29 Python. 48:29 And it is like, it's ridiculous how, and I can say this working for a company that is 48:35 one of the biggest sponsors of the PSF and has done so for years. 48:38 It's ridiculous how small those sponsorships are and yet how grateful we were that they 48:45 came in because every single one has such a big impact. 48:48 You can do so much good with the money that comes in. 48:52 We need more corporate sponsorships more than we need. 48:55 Like, I mean, obviously a million people giving us a couple of bucks, giving the PSF, let's 49:00 be clear. 49:00 I'm not on the board anymore. 49:01 Giving the PSF a couple of bucks would be fantastic. 49:05 But I think the big players in the big corporate players where all the AI money is, for instance, 49:12 having done basically no sponsorship of the PSF is mind-boggling. It is a textbook 49:18 tragedy of the commons right there, right? They rely entirely on PyPI and PyPI is run entirely 49:25 with community resources, mostly because of very generous and consistent sponsorship, 49:31 basically by Fastly, but also the other sponsors of the PSF. And yet very large players use those 49:38 resources more than anyone else and don't actually contribute. Georgie Kerr, she wrote this fantastic 49:45 blog post saying pretty much this straight after Europython. So Europython this year was really big 49:52 actually. And she was wandering around looking at the sponsor booths and the usual players were there, 49:57 but none of these AI companies were there. And the relationship actually between AI, if you want to 50:03 call it that. Let's call it ML and neural networks. And like some of the really big companies and 50:09 Python actually is really complex. Obviously, a lot of these companies and some of us are here, 50:15 employ people to work on Python. Companies like Meta and Google have contributed massively to 50:21 frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras. So it's not as simple a picture as saying cough up money 50:27 all the time. Like there's a more complex picture here, but definitely there are some notable 50:32 absences. And we talked about the volume of money going through. I totally agree with the sentiment. 50:39 When the shortfall came and the grants program had to shut down, we were brainstorming at JetBrains, 50:45 like maybe we can do some sort of, I don't know, donate some more money and call other companies 50:51 to do it. Or we can call on people in the community. And I was like, I don't want to call 50:55 on people in the community to do it because they're probably the same people who are also 50:59 donating their time for Python. Like it's just squeezing people who give so much of themselves 51:05 to this community even more. And it's not sustainable. Like Reuben said, if we keep doing 51:10 this, the whole community is going to collapse. Like I'm sure we've all had our own forms of 51:16 burnout from giving too much. I'm going to pat ourselves on the back here. Everyone on this 51:19 call who works at a company are all sponsors of the PSF. Thank goodness. But there's obviously a 51:25 lot of people not on this call who are not sponsors. And I know personally, I wished every 51:29 company that generated revenue from python usage donated to the psf like and it doesn't see and i 51:35 think part of the problem is some people think it has to be like a hundred thousand dollars it does 51:38 not have to be a hundred thousand dollars now if you can afford that amount please do or more there 51:43 are many ways to donate more than the maximum amount for getting on the website but it's one 51:48 of these funny things where a lot of people just like oh it's not me right like even startups don't 51:51 some do to give those ones credit but others don't because like oh we're we're burning through 51:56 capital level i was like yeah but we're not we're asking for like less so you'd pay a dev right by 52:01 a lot per year right like the amount we actually asked for to get to the highest tier is still less 52:07 than a common developer in silicon valley if we're gonna price point to a geograph geogra geographical 52:13 location we call kind of comprehend i'm gonna steal a net bachelor's observation here and yeah what 52:18 the psf would be happy with is less than a medium company spends on the tips of expensed meals every 52:25 year. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a long running problem, right? Like, I mean, I've been on the PSF for a 52:31 long time, too. I've not served as many years as Thomas on the board, but I was like executive 52:36 vice president because we had to have someone with that title at some point. It's always been a 52:40 struggle, right? Like I and I also want to be clear, I'm totally appreciative of where we have 52:45 gotten to, right? Because for the longest time, I was just dying for paid staff on the core team. 52:50 And now we have three developers as residents. Thank goodness. Still not enough to be clear. 52:55 I want five. 52:56 And I've always said that, but I'll happily take three. 52:58 But it's one of these things where it's a constant struggle. 53:00 And it got a little bit better before the pandemic 53:03 just because everyone was spending on conferences 53:05 and PyCon US is a big driver for the Python Software Foundation. 53:08 And I know your Python's a driver for the European Society. 53:12 But then COVID hit and conferences haven't picked back up. 53:15 And then there's a whole new cohort of companies that have come in post-pandemic 53:19 that have never had that experience of going to PyCon and sponsoring PyCon. 53:22 And so they don't think about, I think, sponsoring PyCon 53:25 the PSF because that's also a big kind of in your face, you should help sponsor this. 53:29 And I think it's led to this kind of lull where offered spending has gone down, new entrants 53:33 into the community have not had that experience and thought about it. And it's led to this kind 53:37 of dearth where, yeah, that PSF had to stop giving out grant money. And it sucks. And I would love 53:43 to see it not be that problem. I want to add one interesting data point that I discovered in 53:47 short. Keep it short. Yes. NumFocus has about twice the budget of the PSF. I was shocked to 53:53 discover this. So basically it is possible to get money from companies to sponsor development of 54:00 Python related projects. And I don't know what they're doing that we aren't. And I think it's 54:05 worth talking and figuring it out. We need a fundraiser and marketer in residence, maybe. Who 54:10 knows? Lauren does a great job, to be clear. The PSF has Lauren and Lauren is that. But it's still 54:18 hard. We have someone doing it full time at the PSF and it's just hard to get companies to give 54:22 cash up cash. 54:23 Yeah, and what do we get in return? 54:25 Well, we already get that. 54:26 So, yeah, I know. 54:27 All right, Barry. 54:28 To just, you know, shift gears into a different area, 54:32 something that I've been thinking a lot over this past year on the steering council. 54:36 Thomas, I'm sure, is going to be, you know, very well aware, 54:39 having been instrumental in the lazy imports PEP A10. 54:45 We have to sort of rethink how we evolve Python 54:50 and how we pose changes to Python and how we discuss those changes in the community. 54:56 Because I think one of the things that I have heard over and over and over again is that authoring PEPs 55:04 is incredibly difficult and emotionally draining and it's a time sink. 55:11 And leading those discussions on discuss.python.org, which we typically call DPO, 55:18 can be toxic at times and very difficult. 55:21 So one of the things that I realized as I was thinking about this 55:25 is that peps are 25 years old now, right? 55:29 So we've had this, and not only just peps are old, 55:33 but like we've gone through at least two, if not more sort of complete revolutions 55:38 in the way we discuss things. 55:40 You know, the community has grown incredibly. 55:43 The developer community is somewhat larger, but just the number of people 55:47 who are using Python and who have an interest in it has grown exponentially. So it has become 55:54 really difficult to evolve the language in the standard library and the interpreter. And we need 56:01 to sort of think about how we can make this easier for people and not lose the voice of the user. 56:09 And the number of people who actually engage in topics on DPO is the tip of the iceberg. You know, 56:14 We've got millions and millions of users out there in the world who, for example, lazy imports will affect, free threading will affect and don't even know that they have a voice. 56:24 And maybe we have to basically represent that, but we have to do it in a much more collaborative and positive way. 56:31 That's something that I've been thinking about a lot. 56:33 And whether or not I'm on the steering council next year, I think this is something that I'm going to spend some time on trying to think about, you know, talk to people about ways we can make this easier for everyone. 56:43 The diversity of use cases for Python in the last couple of years. 56:47 So complex. 56:48 Yes, exactly. 56:49 It should also be preface that Barry created the PEP process. He should have started that one. 56:55 It is that old. 56:57 Yeah. 56:58 By the way, just so everyone knows, these are not ages jokes to be mean to Barry. 57:02 We've always known Barry long enough that we know Barry's okay with us making these jokes. 57:07 To be very, very clear. 57:07 Also, I am almost as old as Barry, although I don't look as old as Barry. 57:12 Yeah, we're all over from the same age anyways. 57:15 Yeah, Barry and I have known each other for 25 years, 57:18 and I've always made these jokes of him. 57:21 So it is different when you know each other in person. 57:26 Let's put it that way. 57:28 For the PEP process, I think for a lot of people, it's not obvious how difficult the process is. 57:35 I mean, it wasn't even obvious to me. 57:37 I saw people avoiding writing peps multiple times, and I was upset, like on the steering council, right? 57:43 I saw people making changes where I thought, this is definitely something 57:47 that should have been discussed in a PEP and the discussion should be recorded in a PEP and all that. 57:51 And I didn't understand why they didn't until, basically until PEP 8.10. 57:56 So I did PEP 779, which was the giving free threading supported status 58:02 at the start of the year. 58:03 And the discussion there was, you know, sort of as expected and it's already, 58:08 was already an accepted PEP. 58:10 It was just the question of how does it become supported? 58:12 That one wasn't too exhausting. 58:14 And then we got to Lazy Imports, which was Pablo, who is another steering council member, 58:20 as well as a bunch of other contributors, including me and two of my co-workers and 58:24 one of my former co-workers, who had all had a lot of experience with Lazy Imports, but 58:29 not necessarily as much experience with the PEP process. 58:32 And Pablo took the front seat because he knew the PEP process and he's done like five PEPs 58:37 in the last year or something, some ridiculous number. 58:40 And he shared with us the vitriol he got for like offline for the, just the audacity of proposing 58:49 something that people disagreed with or something. And that was like, this is a technical suggestion. 58:54 This is not a code of conduct issue where I have received my fair share of vitriol around. 59:00 This is a technical discussion. And yet he gets this, these ridiculous accusations in his mailbox. 59:06 And for some reason, only the primary author gets it as well, which is just weird to me. 59:12 But people are lazy. 59:13 Thomas is what I think you just said. 59:15 Remember, the steering council exists because Guido was the got the brunt of this for Pet 572, which was the walrus operator. 59:24 Right. Which is just like this minor little syntactic thing that is kind of cool when you need it. 59:31 But like just the amount of anger and negative energy and vitriol that he got over that was enough to for him to just say, I'm out, you know, and you guys figure it out. 59:42 And that cannot be an acceptable way to discuss the evolution of the language. 59:48 Especially since apparently now every single PEP author of any contentious or semi contentious pep. 59:55 Although I have to say, Pep 810 had such broad support. 59:59 It was hard to call it contentious. 01:00:01 It's just there's a couple of very loud opinions, I guess. 01:00:04 And I'm not saying we shouldn't listen to people. 01:00:06 We should definitely listen to especially contrary opinions. 01:00:11 But there has to be a limit. 01:00:12 There has to be an acceptable way of bringing things up. 01:00:15 There has to be an acceptable way of saying, hey, you didn't actually read the Pep. 01:00:21 please go back and reconsider everything you said after you fully digested the things, 01:00:27 because everything's already been addressed in the pep. 01:00:29 It's just really hard to do this in a way that doesn't destroy the relationship with the person you're telling this, right? 01:00:37 It's hard to tell people, hey, I'm not going to listen to you because you haven't, you know, you've done a bad job. 01:00:44 You've chosen not to inform yourself. 01:00:46 I think you make another really strong point, Thomas, which is that there have been changes that have been made to Python that really should have been a pep. 01:00:55 And they aren't because people don't want to go through core developers, don't want to go through this gauntlet. 01:01:01 And so they'll create a PR and then that. 01:01:03 But that's also not good because then, you know, we don't have that. 01:01:06 We don't have the right level of consideration. 01:01:11 And you think about the way that, you know, if you're in your job and you're making a change to something in your job, you have a very close relationship to your teammates. 01:01:20 And so you have that kind of respect and hopefully, right, like compassion and consideration. 01:01:26 And you can have a very productive discussion about a thing and you may win some arguments and you may lose some arguments, but the team moves forward as one. 01:01:35 And I think we've lost a bit of that in Python. 01:01:38 So that's not great. 01:01:40 I think society in general could use a little more civility and kindness, especially to strangers that they haven't met in forums, social media, driving, you name it. 01:01:50 Okay, but we're not going to solve that here, I'm sure. 01:01:54 So instead, let's do Gregory's topic. 01:01:57 Hey, I'm going to change topics quite a bit, but I wanted to call 2025 the year of type checking and language server protocols. 01:02:04 So many of us probably have used tools like mypy to check to see if the types line up in our code or whether or not we happen to be overriding functions correctly. 01:02:14 And so I've used mypy for many years and loved the tool and had a great opportunity to chat with the creator of it. 01:02:20 And I integrate that into my CI and it's really been wonderful. 01:02:24 And I've also been using a lot of LSPs, like, for example, PyRite or PyLands. 01:02:28 But in this year, one of the things that we've seen is, number one, Pyrefly from the team at Meta. 01:02:34 We've also seen ty from the team at Astral. 01:02:36 And there's another one called Zubon. 01:02:38 And Zubon is from David Halter. 01:02:41 David was also the person who created JEDI, which is another system in Python that helped with a lot of LSP tasks. 01:02:48 What's interesting about all three of the tools that I just mentioned 01:02:51 is that they're implemented in Rust, and they have taken a lot of the opportunity to make the type checker 01:02:58 and or the LSP significantly faster. 01:03:01 So for me, this has changed how I use the LSP or the type checker and how frequently I use it. 01:03:07 And in my experience, it has helped me to take things that might take tens of seconds or hundreds of seconds and cut them down often to less than a second. 01:03:17 And it's really changed the way in which I'm using a lot of the tools like ty or Pyrefly or Zubon. 01:03:24 So I can have some more details if I'm allowed to share, Michael, but I would say 2025 is the year of type checkers and LSPs. 01:03:31 I think given the timing, let's have people give some feedback. 01:03:34 I personally have been using Pyrefly a ton and am a big fan of it. 01:03:38 I don't know if I'm allowed to have an opinion that isn't Pyrefly is awesome. 01:03:43 I mean, I'm not on the Pyrefly team, but I do regularly chat with people from the Pyrefly team. 01:03:49 Tell people real quick what it is, Thomas. 01:03:51 So Pyrefly is Meta's attempt at a Rust-based type checker. 01:03:56 And so it's very similar to ty. 01:03:58 Started basically at the same time, a little later. 01:04:01 Meta originally had a type checker called Pyre, which was written in OCaml. 01:04:06 They basically decided to start a rewrite in Rust. 01:04:09 And then that really took off. 01:04:11 And that's where we're going now. 01:04:13 Yeah. 01:04:14 Yeah. 01:04:14 I don't know what I can say because I'm actually on the same team as the Pylands team. 01:04:18 So, but no, I mean, I think it's good. 01:04:21 I think this is one of those interesting scenarios where some people realize like, 01:04:25 you know what, we're going to pay the penalty of writing a tool in a way that's faster, 01:04:30 but makes us go slower because the overall win for the community 01:04:33 is going to be a good win. 01:04:34 So it's worth that headache, right? 01:04:36 Not to say I don't want to scare people off from writing Rust, but let's be honest, 01:04:39 it takes more work to write Rust code than it does take to write Python code. 01:04:42 But some people chose to make that trade off and we're all benefiting from it. 01:04:46 The one thing I will say that's kind of interesting from this 01:04:48 that hasn't gotten a lot of play yet because it's still being developed, 01:04:51 But PyLens is actually working with the Pyrefly team to define a type server protocol, TSP, so that a lot of these type servers can just kind of feed the type information to a higher level LSP and let that LSP handle the stuff like symbol renaming and all that stuff. 01:05:05 Right. Because the key thing here and the reason there's so many different type checkers is there are there is a spec. 01:05:12 Right. And everyone's trying to implement it. But there's differences like in type in terms of type inferencing. 01:05:16 And if I actually go listen to Michael's interview, talk Python to me with the Pyrefly team, 01:05:21 they actually did a nice little explanation of the difference between Pyrites approach 01:05:25 and Pyrefly's approach. 01:05:27 And so there's a bit of variance. 01:05:28 But for instance, I think there's some talk now of trying to like, how do we make it 01:05:32 so everyone doesn't have to reimplement how to rename a symbol, right? 01:05:35 That's kind of boring. 01:05:35 That's not where the interesting work is. 01:05:37 And that's not performant from perspective of you want instantaneously to get that squiggly red line 01:05:43 in whether it's VS Code or it's in PyCharm or whatever your editor is, right? 01:05:48 You want to get it as fast as possible, but the rename- 01:05:51 Jupyter. 01:05:52 Jupyter. 01:05:52 No, not Emacs. 01:05:53 Everything but Emacs. 01:05:53 No, not Emacs. 01:05:56 Just to bring things full circle, it's that focus on user experience, right? 01:06:00 Which is, yes, you want that squiggly line, but when things go wrong, 01:06:04 when your type checker says, oh, you've got a problem, 01:06:07 you know, like I think about as an analogy, how Pablo has done an amazing amount of work 01:06:14 on the error reporting, right? 01:06:15 When you get an exception and, you know, now you have a lot more clues about what is it that I actually have to change to make the tool, you know, to fix the problem, right? 01:06:26 Like so many times years ago, you know, when people were using mypy, for example, and they'd have some complex failure of their type annotations and have absolutely no idea what to do about it. 01:06:40 And so getting to a place where now we're not just telling people you've done it wrong, 01:06:44 but also here's some ideas about how to fix it. 01:06:49 I think this is a full circle here because honestly, using typing in your Python code 01:06:54 gives a lot of context to the AI when you ask for help. 01:06:57 If you just give it a fragment and it can't work with it. 01:06:59 That's true. 01:07:00 And also, if you can teach your AI agent to use the type checkers and use the LSPs, 01:07:06 it will also generate better code for you. 01:07:09 I think the one challenge I would add to what Barry said a moment ago is that if you're a developer and you're using, say, three or four type checkers at the same time, you also have to be careful about the fact that some of them won't flag an error that the other one will flag. 01:07:24 So I've recently written Python programs and even built a tool with one of my students named Benedek that will automatically generate Python programs that will cause type checkers to disagree with each other. 01:07:39 I will flag it as an error, but none of the other tools will flag it as an error. 01:07:45 And there are also cases where the new tools will all agree with each other, but disagree with mypy. 01:07:50 So there is a type checker conformance test suite. 01:07:53 But I think as developers, even though it might be the year of LSP and type checker, 01:07:57 we also have to be aware of the fact that these tools are maturing and there's still disagreement among them. 01:08:03 and also just different philosophies when it comes to how to type check and how to infer. 01:08:08 And so we have to think about all of those things as these tools mature and become part of our ecosystem. 01:08:12 Yeah, Greg, that last point is important. 01:08:14 Out of curiosity, how did the things where the type checkers disagree 01:08:18 match up with the actual runtime behavior of Python? 01:08:21 Was it like false positives or false negatives? 01:08:24 That's a really good question. 01:08:26 I'll give you more details in the show notes because we actually have it in a GitHub repository 01:08:30 and I can share it with people. 01:08:31 But I think some of it might simply be related to cases where mypy is more conformant to the spec, but the other new tools are not as conformant. 01:08:43 So you can import overload from typing and then have a very overloaded function. 01:08:48 And mypy will actually flag the fact that it's an overloaded function with multiple signatures, whereas PyRite and Pyrefly and Zubon will not actually flag that, even though they should. 01:09:00 Another big area is optional versus not optional. 01:09:03 Yes. 01:09:03 Like, are you allowed to pass a thing that is an optional string when the thing accepts a string? 01:09:09 Some stuff's like, yeah, it's probably fine. 01:09:10 Others are like, no, no, no. 01:09:11 This is an error that you have to do a check. 01:09:13 And if you want to switch type checkers, you might end up with a thousand warnings that you didn't previously had because of an intentional difference of opinion on how strict to be, I think. 01:09:23 Yeah. 01:09:23 So you have to think about false positives and false negatives when you're willing to break the build because of a type error. 01:09:29 All of those things are things you have to factor in. 01:09:31 But to go quickly to this connection to AI, I know it's only recently, but the Pyrefly 01:09:37 team actually announced that they're making Pyrefly work directly with Pydantic AI. 01:09:42 So there's going to be an interoperability between those tools so that when you're building 01:09:46 an AI agent using Pydantic AI, you can also then have better guarantees when you're using 01:09:52 Pyrefly as your type checker. 01:09:53 It makes total sense, though, because then the reasoning LLM that's at the core of the 01:09:57 agent can actually have that information before it tries to execute the code and you don't get in that 01:10:04 loop that they often get in. You can correct it before it runs. Yeah, really good point. I want to 01:10:09 just sort of express my appreciation to all the people working on this typing stuff. As someone 01:10:14 who's come from many, many years in dynamic languages, I was always like, oh, typing. Those 01:10:27 E, I love seeing how easy it is for people to ease into it when they're in Python. 01:10:32 It's not all or nothing. 01:10:34 C, I love the huge number of tools. 01:10:36 The competition in this space is really exciting. 01:10:39 And D, guess what? 01:10:40 It really, really does help. 01:10:42 And I'll even add an E, which is my students who come from Java, C++, C#, and so forth 01:10:47 feel relief. 01:10:48 They find that without type checking, it's like doing a trapeze act without a safety 01:10:53 net. 01:10:53 And so they're very happy to have that typing in there, 01:10:57 typings in there. 01:10:58 So kudos to everyone. 01:10:59 All right, folks, we are out of time. 01:11:00 This could literally go for hours longer. 01:11:04 It was a big year. 01:11:05 It was a big year, but I think we need to just have a final word. 01:11:10 I'll start and we'll just go around. 01:11:12 So my final thought here is, we've talked about some things that are negatives 01:11:17 or sort of downers or whatever here and there, but I still think it's an incredibly exciting time 01:11:22 To be a developer, data scientist, there's so much opportunity out there. 01:11:26 There's so many things to learn and take advantage of and stay on top of. 01:11:29 And amazing. 01:11:30 Every day is slightly more amazing than the previous day. 01:11:33 So I love it. 01:11:34 Gregory, let's go to you next. 01:11:35 Let's go around the circle. 01:11:35 Yeah, I wanted to give a shout out to all of the local Python conferences. 01:11:40 I actually, on a regular basis, have attended the PyOhio conference. 01:11:44 And it is incredible. 01:11:45 The organizers do an absolutely amazing job. 01:11:49 And they have it hosted on a campus, oftentimes at Ohio State or Cleveland State University. 01:11:54 And incredibly, PyOhio is a free conference that anyone can attend with no registration fee. 01:12:01 So Michael, on a comment that I think is really positive, wow, I'm so excited about the regional 01:12:06 Python conferences that I've been able to attend. 01:12:08 Thomas. 01:12:09 Wow, I didn't expect this. 01:12:10 So I think I want to give a shout out to new people joining the community and also joining 01:12:16 just core developer team as triagers or it's just drive by commenters. I know we harped a little bit 01:12:22 about people, you know, giving strong opinions and discussions, but I always look to the far future 01:12:27 as well as the near future. And we always need new people. We need new ideas. We need new opinions. So 01:12:33 yeah, I'm, I'm excited that there's still people joining and signing up and even when it's 01:12:39 thankless work. So I guess I want to say thank you to people doing all the thankless work. Jodi. 01:12:44 Yeah, I want to say this is actually really only my third year or so really in the Python community. 01:12:52 So before that, I was just sort of on the fringes, right? 01:12:54 And after I started advocacy, I started going to the conferences and meeting people. 01:12:58 And I think I didn't kind of get how special the community was until I watched the Python documentary this year. 01:13:04 And I talked to Paul about this, Paul Everett afterwards, also made fun of him for his like early 2000s fashion. 01:13:11 but I think, yeah, like I'm a relative newcomer to this community and you've all made me feel so 01:13:18 welcome. And I guess I want to thank all the incumbents for everything you've done to make 01:13:24 this such a special tech community for minorities and everyone, newbies, you know, Python, 01:13:30 Python is love. Oh, geez. How am I supposed to follow that? 01:13:37 I think one of the interesting things that we're kind of looping on here is 01:13:41 I think the language evolution has slowed down, but it's obviously not stopped, right? 01:13:45 Like as Thomas pointed out, there's a lot more stuff happening behind the scenes. 01:13:49 Lazy imports are coming, and that was a syntactic change, which apparently brings out the mean side of some people. 01:13:55 And we've obviously got our challenges and stuff, but things are still going. 01:13:58 We're still looking along. 01:13:59 We're still trying to be an open, welcoming place for people like Jody and everyone else who's new coming on over 01:14:05 and to continue to be a fun place for all of us slightly grain-beard people who have been here for a long time 01:14:11 to make us want to stick around. 01:14:12 I think it's just more of the same, honestly. 01:14:15 It's all of us just continuing to do what we can to help out to keep this community being a great place. 01:14:20 And it all just keeps going forward. 01:14:22 And I'll just end with, if you work for a company that's not sponsored the PSF, 01:14:26 please do so. 01:14:26 It's rare to have, I mean, a programming language or any sort of tool 01:14:32 where it is both really, really beneficial to your career 01:14:36 and you get to hang out with really special, nice, interesting people. 01:14:40 And it's easy to take all that for granted if you've been steeped in the community. 01:14:45 I went to a conference about six months ago, a non-Python conference. 01:14:49 And that was shocking to me to discover that all the speakers were from advertisers and sponsors. 01:14:55 Everything was super commercialized. 01:14:57 People were not interested in just like hanging out and sharing with each other. 01:15:00 And it was a shock to me because I've been to basically only Python conferences for so many years. 01:15:05 I was like, oh, that's not the norm in the industry. 01:15:08 So we've got something really special going that not only is good for the people, but good for everyone's careers and mutually reinforcing and helping each other. 01:15:16 And that's really fantastic. 01:15:17 And we should appreciate that. 01:15:19 Barry, final word. 01:15:20 Thomas stole my thunder just a little bit, but just to tie a couple of these ideas together. 01:15:25 Python, and you know, Brett said this, right? 01:15:29 This is Python is the community or the community is Python. 01:15:33 There's no company that is telling anybody what Python should be. 01:15:38 Python is what we make it. 01:15:40 And, you know, as folks like myself get a little older and, you know, and we have younger people 01:15:47 coming into the community, both developers and everything else 01:15:51 who are shaping Python into their vision. 01:15:54 I encourage you, if you've thought about becoming a core dev, 01:15:58 find a mentor. 01:15:59 There are people out there that will help you. 01:16:01 If you want to be involved in the community, the PSF, you know, reach out. 01:16:06 There are people who will help guide you this community. You can be involved. Do not let any self-imposed limitations stop you from 01:16:16 becoming part of the Python community in the way that you want to. And eventually run for the 01:16:22 steering council because we need many, many, many more candidates next year. And you don't need any 01:16:29 qualifications either because I'm a high school dropout and I never went to college or anything. 01:16:34 And look at me. 01:16:35 And I have a PhD and I will tell you, I did not need all that to become a Python developer 01:16:39 because I was the Python developer before I got the PhD. 01:16:42 I'm a bass player. 01:16:43 So if I can do it, anybody can do it. 01:16:47 Thank you everyone for being here. 01:16:49 This awesome look back in the air and I really appreciate you all taking the time. 01:16:52 Thank you, Michael. 01:16:53 Thanks everybody. 01:16:54 Bye everybody. 01:16:57 This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me. 01:17:00 Thank you to our sponsors. 01:17:01 Be sure to check out what they're offering. 01:17:02 It really helps support the show. 01:17:04 Look into the future and see bugs before they make it to production. 01:17:08 Sentry's Seer AI Code Review uses historical error and performance information at Sentry 01:17:13 to find and flag bugs in your PRs before you even start to review them. 01:17:18 Stop bugs before they enter your code base. 01:17:20 Get started at talkpython.fm/seer-code-review. 01:17:25 If you or your team needs to learn Python, we have over 270 hours of beginner and advanced courses 01:17:30 on topics ranging from complete beginners to async code, Flask, Django, HTMX, and even LLMs. 01:17:37 Best of all, there's no subscription in sight. 01:17:40 Browse the catalog at talkpython.fm. 01:17:42 And if you're not already subscribed to the show on your favorite podcast player, 01:17:46 what are you waiting for? 01:17:47 Just search for Python in your podcast player. 01:17:49 We should be right at the top. 01:17:51 If you enjoy that geeky rap song, you can download the full track. 01:17:54 The link is actually in your podcast blur show notes. 01:17:56 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 01:17:58 Thank you so much for listening. 01:17:59 I really appreciate it. 01:18:01 I'll see you next time. 01:18:27 I think is the norm.

Indian markets are poised for a stronger financial year, with improving macros, low inflation, and reviving earnings growth expected to drive equities. Investors are reallocating between assets, with a focus on bottom-up stock selection and sectoral tailwinds. Opportunities are seen in financials, industrials, and defensives, while rate-sensitive segments and CDMOs offer further potential. Overall, Sonthalia believes FY27 could reward disciplined investors who focus on valuations, sectoral tailwinds and bottom-up stock selection rather than chasing crowded themes.

Title: Forecasting the world in 2026: Will Trump win the Nobel peace prize? Will Starmer survive?

The world on the brink of 2026 seems an especially unpredictable and unsettling place. Nonetheless, our team of crystal-ball gazers in The Irish Times have weighed in on what they think will happen in global affairs over the coming 12 months. Will they be right? We’ll find out next year. If you think you can do better than the experts, try submitting your predictions online – at the end of this article – and we’ll compare notes in 12 months, with a prize for our top performer. Happy 2026! – Carl O’Brien, Foreign Editor Yes. Though what form it will take is not clear, and whether it will hold is another matter. US president Donald Trump claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day, and is impatient over the continued absence of a peace agreement. Kyiv feels like it is now only one Trump tantrum away from losing US support entirely – including the military aid and intelligence that are a vital part of its war effort. Europe could fill many, if not all the holes, that an end to US support would leave, but Ukraine sees that Europe is divided and desperate to avoid confrontation with Trump. Add in Russia’s slow but relentless advance on the eastern battlefield, and Ukraine is more likely than not to have to agree to some sort of peace plan in 2026. Daniel McLaughlin, Eastern Europe Correspondent No. There are signs that carbon emissions are peaking but the expectation is they will plateau for at least a few years before slowly reducing. Much depends on China, which is on the cusp of cutting its emissions. But rising emissions elsewhere – the United States, India and Russia – would negate any early progress Beijing can orchestrate. Renewable energy is increasing but energy demand is growing as fast as renewables can expand, if not faster. Rapid growth in AI, increased air conditioning and refrigeration to counteract rising heat, the swelling world population and an expanding global middle class with an appetite for cars and consumer goods all require extra energy and fossil fuels are growing to supply it. If wildfires are as severe in the next 12 months as they have been in the past few years, they will also cancel out the efforts of countries that are actually reducing emissions. Caroline O’Doherty, Climate and Science Correspondent No. It is a marginal call and some Labour MPs believe he might scrape through, but I do not expect Starmer to be able to stand up in the political winds that will blow in 2026. Wales is a write-off for Labour and its 100-year grip on politics there will likely end in devolved parliament elections in May. Labour is also on course to lose in Scotland. But it could be London that finally does Starmer in. London council elections are due on the same day as the Welsh/Scottish votes. If the resurgent Greens eat into Labour’s London vote from the left, and Reform UK erodes it from the right, Starmer may be caught in an unsurvivable pincer grip. He will take the blame for everything. Starmer has been written off before and survived. But it would be a big surprise is he made it past the summer. Mark Paul, London Correspondent No. A row over Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s suggestion that her country could go to war to defend Taiwan has heightened tensions over the self-governing island. Beijing’s policy is to pursue unification, by force if necessary, and some analysts believe that Xi Jinping has been amping up the rhetoric to prepare the Chinese people for military action. Others think that Donald Trump would not send US forces to defend Taiwan, offering a Beijing a once in a lifetime opportunity to launch an invasion. But the island’s topography is such that an amphibious landing would be the most ambitious such operation in military history. And although the People’s Liberation Army is armed with the most advanced weapons technology, they have not been involved in a hot war since the 1970s. More likely are grey zone operations that make life difficult for the island but fall short of a blockade, which would be an act of war. Although polls show an overwhelming majority of Taiwanese oppose unification with the Chinese mainland, parties that want warmer relations with Beijing are gaining popularity. Denis Staunton, China Correspondent No. God, no. This is not merely a sporting endeavour for the land of hope and glory. It is about identity, esteem, obsession and neurosis. It means so much to the English, I believe – nay, as a facetious Irishman, hope – they will bottle it. The quest for a second World Cup 60 years after their first (and a mere aeon since they started talking about it) consumes the English like a case of national dysentery. That they go to the 2026 world cup with their hopes pinned on a German, England manager Thomas Tuchel, makes it worse. If England does win, nothing else will matter. Planets may collide, the seas may rise and a cow might jump over the moon. Keir Starmer could even survive as prime minister. The English won’t care – they will dance in the fountains of Trafalgar Square. It cannot be. Mark Paul, London Correspondent No. The US military build-up off Venezuela is formidable but nowhere near enough for an invasion. The current force is just one tenth the size of that which invaded Iraq in 2003 over land from Washington’s willing client Kuwait. A sea and air invasion of the much larger Venezuela would demand far more military assets than the war-averse president Trump is likely to sanction. The goal instead looks to be to try to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro into fleeing or provoke a coup against him from within his Chavista movement. Trump might also be attracted by the option of an opportunistic air strike. That risk-reward ratio would likely appeal far more to Trump than undertaking his country’s first invasion of a South American state. Tom Hennigan Yes. This year United States financial markets continued a years-long rally, shrugging off the disruption of the Trump administration’s tariffs and broader global uncertainty. The benchmark S&P index of US stocks has hit a record high, part of a years-long rally that began in spring 2022. Just a handful of companies account for most of this growth: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla. Together, they account for about a third of the S&P’s total value and a huge proportion of trading is just in the shares of those seven companies. Much of the rally is fuelled by hopes about the economic promise of AI. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in computing power and data centres to enable AI, which is hugely energy-hungry, but the expected revenues have largely failed to materialise. I’m convinced that the market for an over-hyped technology is not sustainable or resilient to the shocks of a more dangerous world, and is over-concentrated in just a few companies and centred around an over-hyped technology. Expecting the US stock market as a whole to always end up higher in the long run is based on a century of growth in which the US became the dominant global power and the living standards of its citizens were transformed. I’m not convinced the same can be expected of the next century. Naomi O’Leary No. It’s not impossible, but his chances are dimming. Much has happened since María Corina Machado, this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner and the opposition leader in Venezuela, said in October that she is “grateful” for president Trump’s international diplomacy efforts. A fragile peace process continues to hold in Gaza. Against that, the US administration’s attempts to pressure Ukraine into an abomination of a peace deal with Russia and Trump’s continued emboldening of Vladimir Putin are facilitating the sense of threat sweeping through Europe. [ Venezuela’s Machado is backing Trump against Maduro - allies say they’ve tried everything elseOpens in new window ] The Nobel chair said Machado was recognised for her struggle to “achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”. Trump’s political opponents within the US habitually present his administration as a threat to the tenets of democracy there, and the global disapproval of the peace prize awarded by Fifa president Gianni Infantino may dissuade the Nobel committee from entertaining his claims to the prize. But the Nobel Peace Prize honour roll is flawed and contentious and Trump will start 2026 as the bookies’ favourite. Keith Duggan, Washington Correspondent Yes. Germany’s car industry admits it missed the early turn-off to electric mobility. In 2022, VW, BMW and Mercedes looked on in horror as Elon Musk planted his first European factory just outside the gates of Berlin. But Germany’s car industry is not worried about Tesla any more. Instead, its eyes are fixed on a far more serious rival from the east. Chinese car giant BYD has its roots in batteries but now the auto division of Build Your Dreams is the stuff of nightmares for German car executives. After creeping into position in recent years, quietly attracting a loyal and price-conscious customer base in Europe, the Chinese company will move into high gear in October 2027. Its new factory in Hungary, with an initial capacity of 150,000 vehicles annually, will allow the Chinese firm circumvent EU tariffs on Chinese cars. Brussels describes the levies as a response to unfair state subsidies for its car companies. Not a moment too soon, VW will present its own entry-level EV next year, manufactured in Spain and starting at €25,000. If Germany’s car industry is to have a future, and the German economy with it, then this is the make-or-break moment. Derek Scally, Berlin Correspondent Yes – but only just. The US president is determined to begin phase two of the ceasefire in the new year but the challenges are immense, and 53 per cent of Israelis believe the war against Hamas will restart in 2026. Israeli forces remain in control of just over half of Gaza, along a “temporary” yellow line, which Israel’s top general termed a “new border” that would serve as a “forward defensive line for our communities”. There has been almost no discernible progress on any of the key elements of phase two of the ceasefire: Hamas remains dominant, albeit weakened, resisting calls to disarm; the militant group has still to return the body of the last remaining hostage; recruiting an international stabilisation force is problematic; Israel rejects any role for Turkey. In addition, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has still to carry out reforms; Israel rejects a role for the PA; and donors are reluctant to commit with so much uncertainty. Mark Weiss in Jerusalem Yes. As the year ends, Donald Trump’s presidential approval rating has tanked and the inflation crisis that dogged the Biden/Harris election campaign is now swamping the current administration, while Maga discontent is simmering over the administration’s handling of the Epstein files. The recent special elections in Virginia and New Jersey hinted at voting patterns in next year’s midterms. Internal tensions, symbolised by the disaffection of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the refusal by the Indiana state senate to accede to redistricting requests, and December’s candid Vanity Fair interview by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, all hint at an administration fragmenting. [ Amid ominous polls, Republicans start to express dissent towards Trump for the first timeOpens in new window ] But Republican efforts to manipulate the election process through a March executive order (blocked by the courts) to produce passports in order to vote, the continuing redistricting efforts, and fears that federal troops will be used in an attempt to deter voter turnout clouds all reasonable forecasts. The general consensus is that the number of winnable “Republican” seats is much smaller in 2026 than it was in the Democratic blue wave of 2018, and that gerrymandering on both sides has reduced the number of competitive districts. But nonetheless, the Democrats should retake the House majority. Keith Duggan, Washington Correspondent Yes. An irony – no doubt not lost on the newly-Catholic US vice-president JD Vance – is that the leader of his church (and an American), Pope Leo XIV, is increasingly seen as the world leader who is most outspoken and consistent in opposition to the policies of the Trump administration. This is likely to be even more the case in 2026. While other heads of state, prime ministers and dictators bow before Trump, fearing his deployment of tariffs, arms or the US Navy, Leo has done the opposite. From the beginning of his papacy, he has publicly criticised Trump’s treatment of migrants, his splitting with Europe, the betrayal of Ukraine, his threats to Venezuela, not to mention the US-enabled “barbarity” in Gaza. Asked about this in early December, Trump commented: “I’m sure he’s a lovely man. His brother’s [Louis] a lovely man ... Do you know his brother is serious Maga?” The US president, however, is likely to find he is dealing with a very different kettle of fish in “brother” Leo XIV. Patsy McGarry Yes. Although you will probably hear a lot of bluster from the Trump administration in 2026 about how the European Union’s regulations on big tech are unfair, it is unlikely this pushback will threaten the deal Brussels and Washington struck on tariffs. The EU agreed to 15 per cent tariffs on future goods sold into the US. EU negotiators blinked first, meaning we won’t know if Trump would have followed through on threats to hit Europe with cripplingly high import taxes, sparking a proper transatlantic trade war. Trump was able to sell the deal as a win for his radical tariff agenda. He seems content to bank it, even though his tariffs have put domestic prices and farmers under pressure. European politicians have been desperate to keep Trump onside as an ally of Ukraine, meaning they certainly won’t be the ones to rip up the tariff deal.

Title: From AI To SPO: The Top 10 AdExchanger Guest Columns Of 2025
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/opinion/from-ai-to-spo-the-top-10-adexchanger-guest-columns-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T05:45:38Z

Competition between DSPs and SSPs was extra spicy this year. The Trade Desk’s aggressive posture against SSPs – which it branded as “resellers” contributing little to the programmatic supply chain – sparked countless hot takes on ad industry social media channels and in AdExchanger columns. Thought leaders also had plenty to say about increased competition among DSPs themselves, as well as SSPs’ efforts to beat the perception that they’ve become commodified and interchangeable. And supply-path optimization (SPO) and competition in the middle of the programmatic marketplace were front and center for AdExchanger’s guest contributors. Of course, the hottest topic across all industries – generative AI – drove a ton of thoughtful chatter from contributors, with advertisers attempting to separate the hype from reality. And some evergreen industry obsessions – like brand safety, media quality and the need to prove outcomes from ad campaigns – remained top of mind. Here’s our rundown of the top 10 most popular guest columns of 2025 and why they resonated. 1. The Trade Desk’s Blue Ocean Moment: How The DSP Can Rewrite Ad Tech’s Rules By Danilo Tauro, Aperiam Ventures While The Trade Desk made news with its tough stance on SSPs, its efforts to remain competitive with its Big Tech rivals Google, Amazon and Meta also attracted a ton of industry attention. Wall Street, in particular, seemed dissatisfied with TTD’s lack of urgency in the face of growing competition from Amazon DSP, resulting in TTD’s stock price trending downward this year. TTD is missing its true blue ocean opportunity to compete with the walled gardens, Tauro wrote. Instead of chasing CTV inventory or data, which are the specialties of platforms like Google and Amazon, he advised TTD to double down on what Big Tech can’t: independence and accountability. 2. SSPs Are Facing Extinction – And Only Bold Differentiation Can Save Them By Scott Young, Transmit Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. The hard truth behind The Trade Desk branding all SSPs as resellers that need to be cut from the supply chain? Many in the industry agreed. The perception that SSPs are interchangeable and, therefore, expendable, was caused by their efforts to be platform-agnostic, argued Young. He advised SSPs to differentiate themselves by focusing on their original value proposition: increasing publishers’ ad revenue yield. 3. The Death Of The DSP? How Ad Tech’s Cash Flow Crisis Threatens The Entire Ecosystem By Chris Pettit, Revving Microsoft shutting down its DSP (formerly known as Xandr and AppNexus) in May proved that competition isn’t just getting tougher among SSPs. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s move brought back bad memories of unpaid debts caused by the demise of MediaMath, another once-ascendent DSP, back in 2023. When DSPs go out of business, the entire supply chain has to deal with the repercussions. So, publishers, SSPs and other industry stakeholders should prioritize liquidity on their own terms, Pettit wrote. It’s a pretty convenient argument coming from the CEO of a cash-flow management company. But Pettit shed light on a fundamental weakness baked into the programmatic supply chain – one that’s clearly a cause for concern among industry experts. 4. Marketing To Machines: A New Performance Strategy In The Age Of AI Agents By Michael Lehman, Nativo Consumers just don’t click links like they used to. And publishers – and brands alike – have had to adjust to shifting content discovery habits. Simply put, the old SEO playbook is obsolete, argued Lehman. Generative engine optimization (GEO) is the new SEO. And brands that want exposure in search results need to ensure they’re top of mind for AI chatbots. 5. Goodbye, Outcomes Era: Why Quality Will Define The Industry’s Future By Erez Levin, Emet Advisory As we entered 2025, much of the ad industry conversation centered on the idea that digital advertising was firmly in its “Outcomes Era.” Marketers had become laser focused on proving that campaigns produced concrete results, rather than chasing vanity ad tech metrics like viewability. But marketers’ obsession with outcomes is nothing new, Levin wrote, and it’s exactly what led them to chase vanity metrics in the first place. Plus, this fixation on performance has encouraged all kinds of attribution shenanigans, with powerful advertising platforms claiming credit for conversions even if their impact on the consumer’s decision was hard to prove. According to Levin, the better path forward for the industry is to focus on high-quality media and forging close partnerships with premium publishers that command the trust of their audiences. 6. Why Meta’s Exit From MRC Audits Should Be A Wake-Up Call For Marketers By Nicole Scaglione, PubMatic Brand safety is a constant concern for marketers and publishers. But it’s perhaps less of a concern for big social media platforms, who are handing content moderation over to automated systems and community feedback while embracing a flood of AI slop. Meta made social media’s priorities clear in October when it withdrew from the Media Ratings Council’s brand safety audits altogether. These trends should cause marketers to reconsider their commitments to social video, argued PubMatic’s resident video expert – especially as programmatic CTV opens up more premium, brand-safe options. 7. The Brand Safety Myth: Why Most Marketers Don’t Need Brand Safety Verification By Michal Fuchs, Zoomd Speaking of brand safety, maybe marketers don’t need brand safety verification for every campaign use case. Relying on verification vendors for avoiding invalid traffic and outright fraud remains important, argued Fuchs. But most advertisers don’t need to verify every single ad impression as brand safe, and doing so is probably causing more harm than good. 8. AI Is Everywhere, But Where Is It Really Adding Value? By Angelina Eng, IAB The ad industry has a tendency to rush into adopting shiny new technologies, argued Eng. That tendency is a huge risk when it comes to much-hyped but still disproven AI applications. To avoid making the same mistake with generative and agentic AI, Eng offered advice for how advertisers can test these emerging technologies with discipline and an emphasis on clear business objectives. 9. The 7 Traits Every Ad Tech Leader Needs To Thrive In The Age Of AI By Ann Blinkhorn, Blinkhorn LLC and Randall Rothenberg, Randall, Ltd. Winning in advertising’s AI era will require leadership to develop entirely new skill sets. Two ad tech OGs with plenty of experience mentoring industry executives polled some of the top minds in digital advertising to see which traits they think will distinguish the next generation of leaders. 10. Closing The CTV Outcome Data Gap: Unlocking Smarter Optimization Strategies By Cintia Gabilan, IAB While plenty of big-picture topics dominated industry discussion this year, the nuts and bolts of running ad campaigns and measuring outcomes remained just as important as ever. CTV is digital advertising’s hottest media channel, but it’s also one of the more inscrutable ones when it comes to measuring campaign performance. In this column, Gabilan detailed the difficulties industry groups face in creating a standardized conversion API for CTV – but why developing one is essential for the future of campaign measurement.

Title: Streamer Report Card: Streaming Reached A Profit Turning Point In 2025, But Major Players Still Wonder How To Measure Success
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/12/streaming-report-card-2025-1236651338/

Full Content:
By Dade Hayes, Katie Campione After more than five years of gushing red ink, 2025 was the year when streaming across the board started to turn a profit. There are caveats attached to that statement, of course. NBCUniversal’s Peacock is still making losses, and Apple TV’s economics are impossible to disentangle from its trillion-dollar parent company’s, but nevertheless the year in general will go down as a milestone. With that long-sought economic maturity has come greater scrutiny of the balance sheet. Although it sometimes feels like streaming is the only arena that counts, a recent report from Morgan Stanley media analysts noted that spending on linear TV remains about double that on streaming. Gone are the days of the firehose of content; even the sector leader, Netflix, has held the line on content expenses of late. In 2026, Morgan Stanley predicts, “streaming market repair” will be a key phrase across the sector, as “corporate spin-offs and continued cord-cutting are rapidly shrinking legacy TV as an investment factor.” Watch on Deadline Streaming remained a headline-grabber this year even before a game-changing deal centering on the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery (with Netflix and Paramount both in hot pursuit as of this writing) was finalized. Disney launched a beefed up new ESPN app, which blends linear feeds from more than a dozen of its networks with a range of streaming-only fare. Fox Corp., for similar strategic reasons, launched its own flagship, Fox One. While profits and losses are probably the ultimate measure of success, the metrics of streaming underwent a rethink this year, with Netflix and Disney announcing plans to phase out quarterly reports of subscriber numbers. Revenue per user, engagement and other metrics are now en vogue, though success or failure in streaming, as ever, is subject to interpretation. Below, in alphabetical order, are the top streaming players and Deadline’s view about how they fared in 2025 as well as what they’re facing next year. This is intended as a comprehensive look at these services – programming, product and overall status in the field, not just value as M&A chess pieces. 2025 Highlight: Severance. The show returned for its second season this year and quickly became both a critical and cultural darling. It earned 27 Emmy nominations and won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress for Britt Lower and Outstanding Supporting Actor for Tramell Tillman. The streamer is also closing out the year on a high note with Vince Gilligan’s Pluribus, which is already shaping up to be a strong awards contender after earning Rhea Seehorn a Golden Globe nomination. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that F1 scored Apple’s biggest ever box office opening this year, too, via a distribution deal with Warner Bros. 2025 Lowlight: The streaming era has brought about many conundrums, and one that it appears has confounded multiple media companies is what the heck to call their service. While not nearly as egregious as the HBO Max debacle, Apple TV quietly rebranded earlier this year too, removing the “+” sign due to apparent confusion it caused. The problem? It only created more confusion, given that Apple TV is also the name of the streaming hardware it sells, as well as the name of the app within the device. Challenge for 2026: Eddy Cue, Senior Vice President of Services at Apple, admitted in October that the streamer has experienced a few setbacks that have left it “a little further behind than where I’d like to be.” While he pushed back on claims that the service’s subscriber numbers sit around 45M, arguing that it is “significantly more than that,” the point remains that Apple seems to still be small potatoes in the streaming world despite some heavyweight content. The streamer’s financials are reported as part of Apple’s overall services business, lumping them in with music, cloud storage and other operations, but the streamer clearly seems to have a ways to go before it’s in the big leagues. Biggest question for 2026: What is the tech giant’s next move in streaming? As all the chess pieces are moving rapidly across the board, Apple is a peculiar one that seems to have removed itself from the whims of the streaming wars. Apple TV remains the only premium streaming service without an ad tier. The company is also decidedly not joining the furor over Warner Bros. So, it begs the question, will Apple make any big moves next year, or quietly stick to what works? 2025 Highlight: ESPN’s streaming service finally has something to offer. For years, Disney’s sports streaming efforts were hindered by fragmented rights that made it nearly impossible to watch consequential games on its ESPN+ app, but the Mouse House finally upped its game in 2025. After acquiring NFL Network/RedZone, ESPN launched a brand new comprehensive streaming service in August that offered not only every Monday Night Football matchup across both ESPN and ABC this season but a ton of other streaming-exclusive games as well. The WWE also began offering premium live events on ESPN’s app as well. 2025 Lowlight: Although it wasn’t exclusively related to streaming, Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air while facing pressure from the Trump administration was a lowlight for democracy and may have had a negative effect on public perception of the company across the board. Campaigns circulated online encouraging Disney+ and Hulu subscribers to ditch their plans. Independent data reports have estimated millions of Americans canceled their subscriptions in that aftermath, though the economic fallout is hard to quantify. Disney is about to stop reporting streaming subscriber numbers in quarterly earnings reports, so the full impact of that backlash may not be known, since only a portion of those effects were documented in the company’s Q4 earnings. Regardless, it was yet another year of controversy for Disney. Challenge for 2026: Stay in consumers’ good graces. This year was as tumultuous as ever for Disney, and 2026 looks to present its own challenges as the company looks to dip its toes further into user-generated AI content. That ventures could go either way, as consumer sentiment specifically around AI is constantly shifting, but any rollout will surely spark backlash from the creative community. The one thing that is clear is that Disney could benefit from a little less turbulence with consumers in 2026, so it should proceed with caution. Biggest question for 2026: Disney isn’t the only company to tease AI-generated content might soon be available on its streaming platforms, but it certainly has the biggest IP to work from in that regard. After inking a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, how might Disney’s AI ambitions intersect with its streaming offerings in 2026? 2025 Highlight: Becoming the belle of the ball. While HBO Max had gradually earned a place among the top handful of services since its problematic launch in 2020, that uphill climb has gained a big tailwind with the acquisition interest by Netflix and Paramount. While either company taking over would mean more upheaval for a company that has cycled through three owners in a decade, for the streaming business the injection of resources will be dramatic – at least until Netflix merges it out of existence. 2025 Lowlight: The rebranding fiasco of Max going back to HBO Max. While senior execs gamely tried to own the mistake when revealing the revamp at the company’s upfront presentation last May, it still belongs in the corporate annals next to New Coke and Qwikster. Challenge for 2026: Now that it has finally made it to long-forbidden territories like the UK, Germany and Italy (which were unavailable due to a Sky output deal), what can HBO Max make of it? Netflix has become Netflix by incubating global hits from non-U.S. territories. HBO Max should lean into its prestige reputation and take a page from that playbook. Biggest question for 2026: Can movies throw around more weight? As solid a hit as Superman and other releases were in theaters during Warner Bros.’ best year in ages (not to mention Materialists and other A24 releases making their debuts on HBO Max), they made minimal waves in streaming. With Harry Potter set to rekindle interest in the film franchise with a series take due in 2027, the clout of movies could be HBO Max’s not-so-secret weapon. 2025 Highlight: K-pop Demon Hunters. The roaring success of Sony’s animated musical, which landed at the streaming giant under the companies’ pay-1 output deal, gave Netflix something it has been craving: a bona fide franchise. Riding a tide of pop-culture goodwill, a sing-along version of the movie raked in $19.2 million last fall, topping the weekend box office charts. The film also just recently surpassed 500M views on Netflix. 2025 Lowlight: Yet another video game course-correction. Co-CEO Greg Peters, who has overseen the games effort since it began in earnest in 2022, has not tried to put lipstick on a pig. But this year saw the latest strategic shift away from pricey franchise plays and toward casual games suited to the living room. Last fall, Peters made the news personally at an L.A. conference that an adaptation of the board game Boggle was joining the lineup. While the overall business had a banner year, that damp squib of an announcement seemed to sum up the entire gaming misadventure. Challenge for 2026: How can management keep the troops focused as they pursue Warner Bros.? At $82.7 billion, the deal would be exponentially larger than any prior M&A transaction in the company’s nearly three-decade history. The most important task for Peters, Ted Sarandos and other top execs is keeping the industry-leading operation humming. Biggest question for 2026: Will the movie portfolio undergo any more changes under film chairman Dan Lin? The producer and former Warner exec was installed in mid-2024, so his fingerprints may not yet be evident on a recent slate marked by Frankenstein, Electric State, A House of Dynamite, Jay Kelly, and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Lin’s best-known credits include The Lego Movie, It, and other properties with profiles that stand out from Netflix’s recent output. 2025 Highlight: Taylor Sheridan, aka Paramount’s golden goose, kept filling the basket. New seasons of Landman, Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown clicked with viewers, as did MobLand, which wasn’t created by Sheridan but was exec produced by his close collaborator, David Glasser. Despite the upheaval of the merger with Skydance, which closed in August and entailed thousands of layoffs, the content kept flowing. 2025 Lowlight: Losing Taylor Sheridan. With more than three years left on his overall deal with Paramount, the Yellowstone creator announced he would segue to NBCUniversal in 2029. Of course, there is spin on both sides, especially with high-priced talent deals under a microscope across the industry. But the notion that newly minted CEO David Ellison spent time courting Sheridan and came up empty didn’t send the ideal signal to the troops. Challenge for 2026: Ordering off the menu. While Sheridan’s world, South Park, the UFC, CBS programming (including the NFL) and Paramount movies are continuing to be marquee draws for the streaming service, it needs to break new ground if it’s going to muscle its way into the top echelon. Should the WBD quest or other M&A deals bear fruit, they would be a quick route to scale. Regardless, Netflix alum Cindy Holland and her troops will need to come up with an equivalent to Orange is the New Black or the many other follow-ups to House of Cards she presided over in her old job. Those originals positioned Netflix as not just intriguing but essential. Biggest question for 2026: Will David Ellison’s long-promised tech overhaul of Paramount+, with or without the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, bear fruit in the new year? Since the media business set off on the expensive path of chasing Netflix nearly a decade ago, it has made a number of investments that were billed as pixie dust capable of transforming them into true tech giants. AI is the latest element said to confer such power. Technology is ever-present in the ecosystem, so the fact that it exists isn’t new. The main question facing Ellison & Co. is: How will they use it? 2025 Highlight: Love Island USA. Peacock had a lot riding on Season 7 after the reality show finally took off last year, and, boy, did it deliver. The season broke every viewership record it possibly could, becoming Peacock’s most-watched original season ever with 18B minutes viewed throughout the two months it aired this summer. For better or worse, the show was everywhere, and so were its contestants. Notable wins on the scripted front: The Paper and All Her Fault both performed quite well. The Office spinoff was renewed before the episodes even hit the streamer, and All Her Fault topped the Luminate weekly TV rankings in the week it premiered. It was the first time that a Peacock original series had been No. 1 since the Luminate rankings were introduced. 2025 Lowlight: Ads, ads, and more ads. Every major premium streaming platform, save for Apple, has introduced an ad-tier by this point. So, why does Peacock’s approach to ads feel particularly obnoxious? NBCUniversal recently touted “arrival ads,” which will bombard users with an ad as soon as they log onto the platform. The company also says it’ll use AI tools to scan live content and place ads at pivotal moments with which “advertiser’s ad or creative automatically aligns.” Think big moments, like when a team hits the 10-yard line – aka, the time when a viewer would arguably be most agitated by being confronted with an ad. (NBCU execs said at a press briefing this month that the spots will not interrupt the live action but will look to draft off them when a break comes.) Challenge for 2026: Peacock has certainly had its moments, but is it considered a must-have? Having canceleld Poker Face, Based on a True Story, and more this year, the streamer just doesn’t seem to be winning viewers over with its scripted content. The looming sale of WB to one of NBCUniversal’s rivals, Netflix or Paramount, would supercharge either of those studios’ content libraries and could potentially be spell bad news for Peacock, unless it can hold out until 2029 when Taylor Sheridan arrives. Biggest question for 2026: Can sports be its saving grace? A three-year rights deal with bring the MLB to NBC and Peacock in 2026, and the platform will also host the Winter Olympics in February. Peacock also just began streaming WNBA coverage in addition to its ongoing Premier League, NFL and NBA coverage. Oh, and since NBC is hosting the Super Bowl, Peacock will simulcast that as well. While the streamer has yet to make itself essential in the scripted content space, sports buffs would be hard pressed not to have it. 2025 Highlight: The twin home runs of The Summer I Turned Pretty and Thursday Night Football. The third and final season of Jenny Han’s young adult romance came roaring back to the streamer this summer with an audience unlike anything it had ever seen before. Per Prime Video, it amassed 70M viewers globally in 70 days. On the NFL front, Prime Video’s fourth season of TNF is up 13% over last year, marking a third straight season of double-digit growth. 2025 Lowlight: Amazon canceled a lot of series this year including Étoile, Butterfly, Countdown, Bosch: Legacy, Motorheads, The Wheel of Time, Cruel Intentions, and The Runarounds. Lots of arguments to be made as to why any or all of these series should or should not have been canceled, but it’s becoming pretty clear that frequent cancellations negatively impacts consumer sentiment. Challenge for 2026: Prime Video ended the year with the return of Fallout, and Season 2 of Mr & Mrs Smith is delayed indefinitely, leaving just a few heavy hitting scripted series to come in 2026. The Boys set to end next year with its fifth and final season, and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will also return (although, the latter’s second season struggled significantly compared to the first, so Season 3’s performance isn’t a sure bet, either). Given all the cancellations listed above, Prime Video may be hard pressed to make a mark with anything new in 2026. Titles to keep an eye on is the Legally Blonde prequel series, Elle, and the Michelle Yeoh-led Blade Runner 2099. Biggest question for 2026: Will Amazon finally become the one-stop content discovery hub? Analysts’ predictions indicate that the tech giant might eventually introduce a universal search experience that allows users to navigate directly to other external streaming services to watch content. The streamer already quietly introduced a “news hub” that aggregates content from across hundreds of news channels, signaling its desire to become the central online marketplace for not just goods, but entertainment, too.

Comment Name Email Website Δ There are too many major streamers now, okay. Peacock needs to go away, Comcast has failed. When HBO Max merges with either Netflix or Paramount+, that will leave an array of streamers that can survive just fine. If Apple wanted to be in the big leagues, they would need to produce the kind of schlock Netflix does. Bottom feeding “documentaries” about serial killers, frothy romcom fantasy, teen angst, supernatural horror. Prestige drama about rich white people behaving badly and head-scratching sci fi will only get you so far. I hope Apple doesn’t start slumming. We have enough of that. If no longer reporting subscriber numbers, Streamers still have to report the specific income from the service itself, no? Could you not do the math to at least estimate how many subscribers they are getting from that? For Paramount, is Star Trek no longer a factor? South Park is mentioned over this? I know that there has been some criticism of Star Trek shows, but it can’t be that bad. Are people that stupid they can’t keep up with streamer rebranding? Do they really care? It’s like saying people are confused by the difference between an apple you eat and the company that makes phones. Speaking of Apple, how many are getting Apple streaming for free by buying an Apple product? Do they offer free subscriptions when doing so? Here is a possibly odd question: What, if anything, does it cost a streamer to run and maintain the servers providing subscribers their content 24/7? We are now hearing about AI data centers resulting in consumers paying higher electric bills. Are not streaming “data centers” somewhat the same even if not as energy hungry? Is raising subscription prices partly due to running these centers? Is canceling, or even removing, content few, if anyone, is watching, a way to save money by recycling wasted space? Has anyone thought of this? You’d have to also estimate ARPU, which varies throughout the world. For Netflix, ARPU in Asia is about half that of North America. So if Netflix adds a lot of Asian subscribers but doesn’t report subscriber figures, regional breakdown or regional ARPU, then guestimating their figures becomes dicey. And then add in the ad-based tiers, which on the surface is less revenue but actually more when you add in the ad revenue. Ad tiers are generally more lucrative than ad-free ones, which is why the streamers push them. The kind of servers Netflix has, just to serve up video, are much less power intensive than AI servers. Platforms remove content in order not to pay licensing fees on that content. The server space is a small consideration. However, Disney’s move into user generated AI content suggests that AI type servers will become far more of a factor in the future. I expect user generated content to make inroads into all the platforms, except for Apple, because prestige content without big franchises doesn’t mesh with AI nearly as well as the opposite. Star Trek has been terrrrrrible under Paramount’s watch. Strange New Worlds is all right, mainly due to good casting, but becoming stale. Nepo needs to clean house and start over with a new team. In my dreams, he hires Tony Gilroy… Apple is very generous with the free subscriptions. This year I suddenly got three free months for having a Roku TV, which was not new either so I was confused but happy to take the freebie. Streamers raise prices to whatever the market will bear. They will stop only when it causes churn in excess of the benefit of the price hike. This is true of every other business too. Prices are not set by the cost of goods. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $99 to make, the price is $100. If people will pay $100 for a product and it costs $1 to make, the price is $100. These streamers might be able to keep viewers attention if they didn’t wait so long between seasons. For example stranger things now has full blown adults on the show when they started out as kids. My attention span moves on if I can’t go back to a show within a reasonable time span without having to refresh my memory. The biggest elephant in the room. Short attention spans, social media and YouTube…. Yup. When everything finally shakes out I dont expect to see more than three to five streamers left standing. Ultimately Peacock can’t survive on its own, and it’s possible Paramount can’t either. Perhaps something happens between those two after Netflix gobbles up Warner Bros. Or perhaps Apple, cautiously biding its time, steps in to acquire whatever legacy leftovers remain. netflix and hulu have always been profitable, though hulu’s margins have been declining since even before disney bought it. none of the other platforms are or have ever been profitable.

Title: ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton predicts 2026 will see the technology get even better and gain the ability to ‘replace many other jobs’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/28/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-2026-prediction-human-worker-replacement/
Time Published: 2025-12-28T20:03:21Z
Full Content:
Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said artificial intelligence technology will continue improving next year, enough to wipe out more human workers. During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, he was asked for his 2026 predictions after declaring 2025 a pivotal year for AI. “I think we’re going to see AI get even better,” Hinton replied. “It’s already extremely good. We’re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It’s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it’s going to be able to replace many other jobs.” He added that AI’s progression is such that after every seven months or so, it is able to complete tasks that took twice as long as before. That means that on a coding project, for example, AI can do in minutes what used to take an hour. And in a few years, AI will be able to perform software engineering tasks that now need a month’s worth of labor. “And then there’ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,” predicted Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI.” Earlier in the interview, he was asked if he was more or less worried about AI since he left Google in 2023 and started warning about the technology’s dangers. “I’m probably more worried,” he answered. “It’s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it’s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.” If an AI believes someone is trying to prevent it from achieving its goals, it will try to deceive people in order to remain in existence and complete its tasks, he explained. To be sure, AI can also benefit humanity by helping researchers make breakthroughs in medicine, education and climate-related innovations. But Hinton said he’s not sure if the risks from AI outweigh the positives. “But along with those wonderful things comes some scary things, and I don’t think people are putting enough work into how we can mitigate those scary things,” he warned. Some AI companies are doing more than others in trying to ensure safety, but Hinton said there’s also a profit motive and tradeoffs that executives are weighing. “They may think there’s a lot of good to be done here, and just for a few lives we’re not going to not do that good,” he said. “For driverless cars, they will kill people, but they’ll kill far fewer people than ordinary drivers.” Hinton has been consistently sounding the alarm on AI, and in recent months has flagged its potential to put humans out of work. In October, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he told Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week. While some studies show AI is improving the productivity of existing workers rather than leading to mass layoffs, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level. A recent analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. Companies like Amazon have announced layoffs while also acknowledging efficiency gains from using AI. And in September, Hinton said AI will create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits, attributing it to the capitalist system. “It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer,” he told the Financial Times

Title: Several factors affecting success for job hunters in Lehigh Valley

Sherri Skok wants to work full time. But she is having trouble finding a company that wants her. The 61-year-old Easton resident has a resume with plenty of experience as a personal assistant/chief of staff in corporate offices, including two decades at Barnes & Noble. Apparently, it’s not enough — or it may be too much — for a long list of Lehigh Valley businesses that have advertised openings. Skok has kept a list of them; places where she’s interviewed and was subsequently rejected. Some of them couldn’t be bothered even to send a reply after they talked, which is referred to as “ghosting.” Many others simply didn’t reply to the application, which these days are mostly filled out online. Skok, who has found part-time employment since talking to The Morning Call in early November, said she probably filled out more than a thousand applications, including about 50 since moving to the Lehigh Valley this year. She says she’s received at least one interview for about a quarter of them. “I apply for jobs, and maybe I’m not 100% qualified for or even interested in, just to see where it might lead,” said Skok, who grew up in Macungie and graduated from Emmaus High School and Penn State. “I’ve been aggressive about it. I sometimes spend eight hours a day doing it. I think there has to be an angle [on a job] I’m not considering or maybe I should go about it this way, or let me reach out. There are many, many ways. But it didn’t yield anything.” Her story isn’t unique. Social media has plenty of anecdotes from hard-luck job candidates who have applied to hundreds of them without a bite. Some economists have referred to it as a “jobless boom,” a period of economic growth and high corporate profits that coincides with weak job creation and even layoffs. Michael Rivera, assistant professor of business information systems at Lehigh University, confirmed that Skok has plenty of company. “I think it’s somewhat universal,” he said. Uncertainty about the economy and politics have made some employers reluctant to add workers. “I have spoken to many companies that have funds [to hire, but] that are just hesitant,” Rivera said. “They’re not quite sure where things are going to net out, and it has impacted where they’re looking to make investments.” Additional headwinds for people on the job search are a wave of recent layoffs nationwide with 150,000 workers losing their jobs in October, according to the Associated Press. The cuts are coming from business giants such as Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Target and UPS that are not only dealing with uncertainty over tariffs, but are also looking at ways to implement artificial intelligence in their operations. “We’re reading about strong layoffs proposed for companies that are happening,” Rivera said. “Most recently, I read an article on Walmart’s CEO that says get ready, every single job is going to change and it’s going to have AI in it. Walmart’s plan is for more revenue without increasing its workforce.” The federal government didn’t release labor statistics during the shutdown, but payroll processor ADP reported private sector companies shed 32,000 jobs in November. According to Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, the region’s unemployment rate was at 4.9%, as of September — the most recent statistics available — with job postings up over the year by 18.9% at 15,700. Nationally, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate fell to 3.2% in October, matching the lowest figure since March 2013, not counting the pandemic. After several years at Barnes & Noble — where Skok said she earned “six figures” — she was terminated in 2019 after the company was sold. “At the end of the day, loyalty doesn’t mean anything because when the company got sold, they eliminated my department just like that,” Skok said. Skok had a complicated job search process that wasn’t helped by the COVID pandemic, which put some promising roles on hold. She did find a chief of staff position with a fitness influencer, but left after questions of financial problems. After that was a year with a small equity firm, but she was let go after a major investor dropped out. To keep her finances on track, Skok sold her home in northern New Jersey “to put money in the bank” and took up residence in Easton to continue the job search. Skok said she’s applied to a “who’s who” of local companies and nonprofits since she moved back to the Lehigh Valley. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour. Two months later, the position still was not filled, highlighting her frustration with even finding a lower-wage position. Cathy Rychalsky, who recently took over as executive director at Workforce Board Lehigh Valley, said there is a lot of frustration among job seekers, many of whom never hear back about their applications. She also said some employers are overwhelmed by the number of applications because many are people who apply to jobs not within their skillset to satisfy unemployment requirements. They simply don’t have the staff to review every application and are forced to use things as AI for screening purposes. Another factor is changes in the labor market since the pandemic as employers can be pickier with the applicant pool. “The pendulum has shifted post-pandemic,” Rychalski said. “During the pandemic, people were able to write their job description and how much they wanted to get paid. Today it doesn’t look like that, and it shifted fairly quickly. It has shifted back where the employer is really driving the car.” What to do? Rivera said that even during the search, job seekers should take command of their growth and development. “That is something that is within their span of control. They can guide that,” he said. “They need to be taking an active approach. If they’re taking a passive one, they really run the risk of having other employees outgrow them.” Rivera said earning another college degree isn’t necessary, but he recommended such things as reading, watching videos and attending seminars to improve skills. Writing a resume for the future, which includes skills and competencies you want to have in three to five years, can be a guide. Old strategies, such as networking and making human connections, are still very effective. It’s OK to use AI in the job search to tailor resumes and cover letters to align them with the job description’s keywords, he said. With companies adopting AI, it’s important to show how job seekers are integrating those tools into their skillsets. “I’ve found that the No. 1 thing that companies are looking for today is adaptability,” Rivera said. “At the moment an employee is hired, they need to be growing with market and industry trends, with their corporate culture, always looking to kind of extend their abilities further and further with new tools and new approaches.” Rychalsky suggested using services such as Pennsylvania CareerLink. She said it’s helpful to talk to someone about the ups and downs of the job hunt. “Having someone who’s on the lookout for you, who is connected to the business community, who can maybe even reach out on your behalf and ask if this person did apply, could they reconsider them?” Rychalsky said. “If we don’t have a connection with that business, we might be able to make that connection. That’s what CareerLink is here to do. It’s here to help the job seekers, and is here to help the business community.” Meanwhile, Skok will continue her search for a full-time position that includes benefits. “It’s not like a one-person flight. There are many, many people in the United States who are facing this right now,” she said. “And they’re good qualified candidates. I just don’t understand how the job market became so overly competitive. I asked myself, do these jobs even exist? Is it a way to take your information? Who knows?” Morning Call reporter Evan Jones can be reached at ejones@mcall.com. “Some were flat-out rejections,” she said. “At some point, I got an interview and it seemed to go well, and then I’m either ghosted or If I inquire, I’ll find out that the position is no longer available.” One that stood out for Skok was an interview for a manager’s position at a local bookstore that paid between $11 and $19 an hour.

Title: America's affordability crisis is putting Aldi in the spotlight

Time Published: 2025-12-27T18:40:49Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Newlyweds Brittany Zwier and Frank Martinez are starting their life together looking for ways to save money. Zwier, 32, and Martinez, 40, have an annual income of more than $100,000 — but are finding their dollars aren’t stretching as far as they used to. The couple now buys groceries exclusively at the no-frills supermarket chain Aldi, where they say the prices are cheaper than at other stores. “We’re just buying what we need right now,” Zwier said outside an Aldi in New Jersey. They have stopped buying beef, which hit record-high prices this year as climate and import issues limited cattle supply. Zwier and Martinez are not alone. For millions of Americans, the cost of living has risen sharply in recent years, fueled by a mix of persistent inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and consumer price increases due to tariffs. More than half of respondents in a recent NBC News poll said they have changed the groceries they buy in order to stay within their budgets. In the same survey, the cost of housing and the cost of food ranked as the top two economic problems respondents said their families were facing. This affordability crisis continues despite recent signs pointing to a resilient economy. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones stock indexes both closed at record highs on Christmas Eve. And newly released data showed that GDP grew 4.3% in the third quarter of the year, much more than economists had been expecting. The spoils of a booming stock market are not being distributed evenly. Economists say consumers are separating into two distinct tiers — what they’re calling a K-shaped economy. “The K-shape economy means that some Americans, usually the wealthiest Americans, are doing just fine,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “They’re in the top of the K. Their incomes are rising. Their spending is rising.” But many on the lower end of the “K” are finding their paychecks can’t keep up with rising costs of food, housing, utilities and child care. “They feel like they’re falling behind, or, if on a good day, maybe treading water,” Long said. To keep their expenses in check, Zwier and Martinez have cut back on eating out. “Maybe once every three months now, we’ll go out,” said Martinez. “Used to be at least date night here and there. But that’s something we’re now sacrificing because everything is just too expensive.” Zwier and Martinez are part of a broader pullback in restaurant spending — one that is taking a bite out of fast-casual spots like Chipotle, Cava and Sweetgreen. “A lot of the chain restaurants have had a hard time in this environment where people don’t want to pay $15 to $20 for a burrito or a salad,” said Long. The K-shaped shift has also drawn the attention of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “We’re seeing people tightening their belts, changing products that they buy, buying less,” Powell said at a recent press conference in Washington. And the price pinch many consumers are experiencing this year goes beyond food. Zwier and Martinez have seen their electric and gas bills skyrocket. “We’re using less, and it costs more,” Zwier said. Across the country, electricity costs have jumped 6.9% in the last year, more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This winter, U.S. households could spend an average of $995 on home heating alone, an increase of $84 from 2024, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “These increases may not sound dramatic to higher-income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. “But for families already struggling, they are devastating.” Budget retailers and grocers like Costco, Walmart and Aldi are well positioned to benefit from shifting spending habits among higher- and middle-income consumers. “We’re seeing shoppers across all demographics and income levels turning to Aldi, because the simple truth is that no one wants to pay more for groceries than they have to,” an Aldi spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. Aldi has seen explosive growth over the last decade. The grocer said it operated 1,230 U.S. stores in 2012. That number had nearly doubled to around 2,400 U.S. stores in 2023. And Aldi plans to expand further with 800 new stores nationwide by 2028. The discount supermarket chain has gained a reputation for low prices and a bare-bones approach. Coin-operated shopping carts, few name-brand products and items shelved in cardboard containers and crates are all part of the Aldi experience. The promise of low prices draws shoppers like Michael Torres, who said he has been coming to Aldi for the last couple years. Torres and his wife, who have a 1-month-old daughter, are finding ways to make ends meet on an income of less than $50,000 a year. “As much as you can save is important,” Torres said outside a New Jersey Aldi earlier this month. “You still want to make sure you have the fridge full, whatever you need on the table.” “There’s wants and there’s needs,” he added. “If you need something, you get it.” But for now, he said, some “wants” may have to wait. As many Americans pull back on spending, the U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on high-income households. The top 10% of earners were responsible for a record 49.2% of total U.S. consumer spending in the second quarter of this year, according to Moody’s Analytics. Many businesses are seeing strong demand for their premium fare. Ford and General Motors recently reported soaring sales for their biggest and priciest SUVs. Some companies are also building out their higher-end offerings to draw in big spenders. This month, American Airlines debuted a splashy new plane with lie-flat seats and Bluetooth connectivity while budget carrier JetBlue just opened its first airport lounge. But economists warn that relying on a tiny slice of Americans to drive consumer spending could put the U.S. on shaky footing. Consumer spending makes up the lion’s share of the nation’s total economic activity. “Whether the economy goes into a recession in 2026 hinges almost entirely on the top 20%,” said Navy Federal Credit Union’s Long. “If they do well, the overall economy does well. If they don’t, then we’re looking at a recession.” In the meantime, she said, everyone else could face growing pressure. “Wage gains are going to keep getting smaller, and inflation, those basic costs, are going to keep ticking up,” Long said. “That’s a recipe for middle-class squeeze.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Kelley Blue Book Says These 5 SUVs Are Some Of The Best Cars You Can Buy
URL: https://www.moneydigest.com/2058238/kelley-blue-book-suvs-best-cars-you-can-buy/

Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver. As a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below. Rated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring. Yet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are "underwhelming," while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year. In terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value. Kelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon. But where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years. With a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes. The winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features. In terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs. The '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions. On the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value. Large enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes. Edmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025). But if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.

Title: Nvidia Just Paid $20B for a Company That Missed Its Revenue Target by 75%

If you’ve heard “Grok” thrown around lately, you’re probably thinking of Elon’s chatbot from xAI. We’re not talking about that one. That model isn’t particularly good, but its whole value prop is being politically incorrect so you can get it to say edgy things. The company Nvidia bought is Groq (with a Q). Totally different beast. If you’ve used any high quality LLM, you’ve noticed it takes a while to generate a response. Especially for something rapid fire like a conversation, you want high quality AND speed. But speed is often what gets sacrificed. There’s always that “thinking... gathering my notes... taking some time to form the best response” delay. Groq specialized in hardware and software that makes this way faster. They created a new type of chip called an LPU (Language Processing Unit). It’s based on an ASIC, an application specific integrated circuit. If that’s confusing, don’t worry about it. It’s just a processor that does a specific type of task really well. So imagine you’re talking to Gemini and it takes a couple seconds to respond. Now imagine it responded instantly, like 10 or 100 times faster. That’s the problem Groq was solving. To go one level deeper on LPUs versus GPUs (the processors most LLMs run on, typically Nvidia cards): those GPU calculations have to access a lot of things in memory. Nvidia’s chips depend on HBM, high bandwidth memory. But LPUs use something called SRAM that’s much faster to reference. Think about it like this. Your wife has a grocery list for you. You go to the store but forget the list. Every time you’re in an aisle, you have to call her on the phone: “Hey, do I need anything from the bread aisle?” Get the bread. Put the phone down. Go to the next aisle. “Hey, do I need anything from canned goods?” And so on through produce, meat, pick up the beer, check out, get home. Very inefficient. Groq’s approach is like you just took the list to the store. Get to a new aisle, look at the list. Next aisle, look at the list. Much faster than a phone call. That’s the key difference. Nvidia GPUs are phoning out every time they hit a new aisle. Groq’s LPUs mean the shopper has the list in their pocket. Groq’s main offering is GroqCloud. An engineer like me isn’t going to go out and buy an LPU (I don’t even know if they’re commercially available). What I’m going to do is, if I need lightning fast response in an application I’m building, I’ll use GroqCloud. That inference happens at an extremely fast rate, running on LPUs in a data center somewhere. Their value prop is: fast, cheap, low energy. Where they’ve been falling short is they mostly use open source models. Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS (OpenAI’s open source offering). These are decent models, but nowhere near the quality of something like Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro. Groq positioned themselves for hardcore use cases where milliseconds matter. One of their big industry fits is real time data analysis for Formula 1. When your driver’s out there on the track, you don’t have time to send a query to Gemini and wait 20 to 30 seconds to figure out if you should pit this guy for new tires this lap. You want something like Groq which does pretty good analysis, really really really fast. This is insider baseball you’re going to miss from mainstream news headlines. The media is paying attention to Grok (Elon’s chatbot), not Groq (the chip company). This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s just that the only people aware of Groq are software developers and tech nuts like me. This is a canary in the coal mine for worse things to come in 2026. About a year ago, Groq announced a $1.5 billion infrastructure investment deal with Saudi Arabia. They also secured a $750 million Series D funding round. These are crazy multiples even for a software company that’s somewhat leveraged in hardware. Bubble level projections. To visualize $1.5 billion: if you cashed that check out in $100 bills and stacked them one on top of another, it would reach a five story building. For ordinary plebeians like us, at the average US salary of around $75K, you’d need to work 20,000 years to earn that. At that time, the company was valued at $2 billion. Hello bubble. Then in maybe one of the best rug pulls of all time, in July they quietly changed their revenue projections to $500 million.1 A 75% cut in four months. I’ve never seen anything like that since the 2008 financial crisis. Prefer to Watch the Video This was a company valued at $2 billion, enough that the government of Saudi Arabia was investing at that valuation. Then they took a 75% haircut four months later without anything major happening. If it can happen to Groq, who else can it happen to? Nvidia? Intel? The rumors started flying on Christmas Eve. Confirmed the 26th: Nvidia will be buying Groq, their key product line, and key personnel including the CEO, for $20 billion. Let’s walk through that again: February: $2 billion valuation July: Down to $500 million December: Nvidia buys them for $20 billion after they took a 75% haircut What is going on? This is a bubble. The only explanation is this is a fear purchase. Groq was promising faster, cheaper, more efficient, less electricity use for their chips. But they couldn’t scale fast enough to compete with the vendor lock in and buddy system Nvidia has going. Nvidia’s buying them with their insanely inflated war chest. They don’t want a chunk taken out of their market share. They can’t afford to take that chance. So it’s like they’re just saying: “Shut up, take the $20 billion, walk away from this project.” This is a sign that in order to succeed, Nvidia needs a monopoly on the market. Otherwise they would not pay ten times the company’s valuation that was then decreased by 75%. This is a desperate move to consolidate the market into “you have to go with us.” Saudi Arabia didn’t keep that $1.5 billion sitting around. They redirected it to Nvidia and AMD instead. Nvidia still gets paid ofc. Smaller competitors like Cerebras and Inflection, doing things in Groq’s space or exploring different architectures for AI inference, are canceling IPOs, dropping like flies, seeking emergency funding. The chatter I’m hearing from VCs and friends in that world? Ain’t nobody buying it right now. Google made their own chip. Microsoft and Amazon are racing to make competition chips that run on less electricity, are more efficient, faster. But no matter what anybody does, the market is consolidating around the Nvidia monopoly for AI hardware. Engineers like me and architects at large enterprises are trying to escape this. Once they consolidate enough of the market, they can set their price for chips and usage. If you don’t own them, you go through Oracle or some cloud computing service, and they can charge whatever they want because there will be no competitors. Even a competitor having a rough time but getting some traction? They just buy them out for $20 billion because with this monopoly going, that’s pocket change. $20 billion is a rounding error to Nvidia. The AI infrastructure boom ran on one large errant assumption: that power is cheap and plentiful. That assumption was very, very wrong. We’ve seen parts of the power grid fail, go unmaintained. There’s a great article on Palladium called “The Competency Crisis” that explains some of what’s going on in the US right now. Electricity is now the bottleneck. It’s the constraint. Too expensive or you can’t get enough of it. Who’s paying these costs? The tech companies aren’t. Trump is meeting with Jensen Huang, with Sam Altman. He hasn’t been over my place lately. He hasn’t invited you to the White House to talk about how you can’t afford groceries and eggs cost three times what they did a few years ago. No. You and I are going to pay to subsidize the electricity constraints. US data centers are using about 4% of all electricity right now. If growth continues at the same rate, in ten years they’ll use 9%. Almost one tenth of all electricity generated in the US. I’m not much of an environmentalist. But even someone like me, pretty jaded to some amount of waste because of industrialization, something like this actually makes my stomach turn. In places with lots of data centers, AI heavy regions, they’re experiencing about a 250% increase in energy costs compared to just five years ago. That’s huge. Even compared to grocery costs, which are out of control. At least with food you have alternatives. Red meat too expensive? Buy chicken. Chicken too expensive? Buy eggs. But electricity? You have to run electricity. It’s a public utility. You can’t just “use a lot less” when your bill goes up 2.5x. Let me walk you through what happens. Some business development guy from Oracle wants to build a new data center in Rural America. A year before it’s even built, they meet with city officials, maybe the governor. They grease the right people. Get legislation passed with the utility companies that says they’ll pay a preferential rate for electricity because they’re going to use a shit ton. They’re Oracle or Nvidia, they’re good for it. They pay five years upfront. Then the utility decides what to do with the rest of the electricity. The grid is strained. They want everyone else to use less. They can’t just tell them to use less, so they keep raising the price until naturally you just can’t afford to use more. You turn the lights off. Turn the TV off. Get those LED bulbs that disrupt your sleep. Do everything to keep electricity costs down. But you and I are left holding the bag. The data center folks aren’t paying for that, they paid upfront at a preferential rate. Senate Democrats are allegedly investigating this. I’ll believe it when I see it. These tech companies have their hooks so far into influential politicians. It’s a vote grab. I’d be happy to be wrong about that, but I know I’m not going to be. I talked about this in my last piece on the AI bubble. This computer communism that’s going on, pricing you out of personal computing, keeping it all in the family of these tech companies. But with the Groq deal confirmed, it’s gone one step further. Nvidia is not just selling chips anymore. They are lending money to customers who buy the chips. They are artificially inflating demand. It’s like if I run a small grocery store and I need to show good signal to investors that I’m bringing cash in the door. So I go downtown during farmer’s market and give everybody a $20 voucher to use at my store. I take a wholesale hit when they come in and buy stuff. But what I can show is: “Hey, people are coming in and spending money. Look at the revenue. Give me more venture capital money.” This can’t work infinitely, for the same reason any perpetual motion machine can’t work. Back in September, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. Coming through in $10 billion tranches over time. And it’s not equity, it’s lease agreements for Nvidia’s chips. Literally paying them to pay themselves.There’s probably some tax shenanigans going on there since they’re typically offering $xxx in leases of their chips to the company they’re “lending” to. Assuming they do this in part because the depreciation on the physical asset (the chips) can be written off on their taxes somehow. They’re essentially incentivizing another person to use them with money. Even OpenAI’s CFO has admitted, quote: “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia.” They’re playing both sides. In the OpenAI case, they’re financing software that uses their chips. But they’re also getting their hooks into data centers. CoreWeave: they have something like 7% share in the company. Worth $3 billion. That’s funded by GPU revenue from CoreWeave. Lambda: another data center operator. That’s a $1.3 billion spending deal. Renting Nvidia’s own chips back from them. They’ve pledged to invest £2 billion across British startups, which of course are going to go back to Nvidia chips one way or another. In 2024, they invested about $1 billion across startups and saw a $24 billion return in chip spend. They 24x’d their billion dollar investment in one year. Nvidia has more power than the Fed right now. More power than the president over the economy. They have their hand on the knob of the economy. They can choose how fast or slow they want it to go. If the Nvidia cash machine stops printing, if they stop funding startups, data centers, hardware companies, software companies, that whole part of the economy slows way down and maybe crashes if investors get spooked. I’m waiting for somebody to blow the whistle on this. I’m not a finance guy, so it’s strange I’m even talking about it. But their entire success story for the next couple years hinges on their $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which they’re expecting to bring back about $300 billion in chip purchases. It’s vendor financing. It’s sweetening the pot on your own deals. I cannot believe more people are not talking about this. OpenAI, the leader of this space, the company whose CEO Sam Altman is invited to the White House numerous times, probably has a direct line to Trump, a lot of the economy hinges on this guy’s strategy, opinions, and public statements. And he runs a company that is not profitable. Actually insane if you think about it. All he’s done with that company, from an economics point of view, is rack up debt. Spent more than he’s earned. By that metric, I’m richer than Sam Altman. Not in net worth. But if I consider myself a business and the fact that I bring in any salary at all, even a dollar a year, that would make me earn more than Sam Altman, who has only lost money. In the next few years, they’re expected to burn something like $75 billion a year. Just set that money on fire. I have a credit card with no preset spending limit, but I assume if I run up a $75 billion charge it’s going to get denied. By their projections, they think they’ll become profitable around 2029/2030, and they need $200 billion in annual revenue to offset their debts and losses. To visualize $200 billion: if you cashed that out in $100 bills and stacked them, it would reach halfway to the International Space Station. That’s how much they’d have to make every single year to just be profitable. Not be a massively successful company. Just to not spend more than they earn. 2024: Spent $5 billion, earned $3.7 billion. Spending $1.35 for every dollar earned. 2025: Set $8 billion on fire (after profits). 2028 (projected): Will lose $74 billion that year. Just lose it. Cumulative losses through 2029: $143 billion. They’d need to make $200 billion in a year to offset that. Are they including interest? I have no idea how these things work, but in simple terms: they’re spending a lot more money than they make. Groq was kind of a one off because Nvidia panic bought the competition. But they also need to figure out how to get prices down or they can’t keep this money machine moving. Groq is probably one of the last companies that caught a good lifeboat off a sinking ship. What we’re going to see this year: it’ll start small, but get major. A company first, then multiple larger ones, that had a 2025 valuation, will go to raise. They’ll do a 409A evaluation. A bunch of smart analysts will say what it’s worth to investors. And you’re going to see the valuation drop. They won’t be able to raise money. Then the shit is really going to start to hit the fan. The dominoes will start falling. That’s probably what kicks off the actual pop, and it’s imminent. Any day now. Part of the big gamble they’ve sold investors is: we’ve got to replace you. The worker. That’s why we need to spend so much money, go into debt. It’ll all be worth it because then we won’t have to pay people to do these jobs anymore. We’re going to continue to see massive labor displacement. To a degree this is a shell game, an investor illusion. What these larger enterprise companies are hoping to do: cut a lot of folks, have big layoffs, say it’s because AI is replacing the jobs. In some cases they’re right. Data entry, for example. I don’t mean to be mean if you do data entry for a living, but there are models very good at that now. You need someone to manage the work, spot check it. But it’s kind of a job AI can do. Like how grocery stores have automatic checkout lines now with one person monitoring six or eight of them. So some of that’s real. A lot of it isn’t though. They cut a bunch of American workers under the guise that AI’s replacing workers. A lot of these megacorp execs are actually convinced of it. Americans are expensive, especially tech workers. Then they see: damn, maybe we could have cut some, but not as many. We got greedy. Now our services are failing in production. AWS in Northern Virginia is flaky, going down again. That just happened, by the way, direct result of these layoffs. So instead they think, “We’ll look globally! Spin up a campus in Hyderabad!” Pay them way less. The cost of living is less there, they expect less. Bring them over on H-1B when needed. I’ve written about the H-1B program. This is nothing against the individuals on that program. I’ve worked with very talented H-1Bs, and some very inferior ones, just like American citizens. But the corporate sleight of hand is something like this, we can get those H-1B visas, and they’re not going to ask for pesky stuff like Sunday off for church. We can put them on call 24/7 and they can’t say no because if they do, we kick them back to their country. Same thing that’s happened with migrant labor in farming over the past century. Even if it doesn’t look like it on the surface, corporations know that they can pay H-1B employees less than American citizens. If a US citizen and H-1B recipient both make $120k but the H-1B works double the hours because they have no room to push back and are under threat of being sent home, they are making 50% less than the American per-hour. Amazon/AWS: 14,000 laid off. Microsoft: 15,000 total just in 2025. Salesforce: My favorite one. 4,000 customer support roles cut. And the CEO is gloating about it in interviews. So great that he can replace workers! Now Salesforce is admitting that they fucked up. They cut too many people. I’ve been on the other side of this when I was an engineering director at a Fortune 500 company. They were neurotic about tracking AI use. Spending an exorbitant amount of money on shitty AI tools. Like tools from a year ago. GPT-4o in the GPT-5 era, in the Anthropic dominance era. More or less useless. Not only would they monitor all usage across employees, specifically who’s using it how much, they could see every single message being sent to the AI. So theoretically you could check somebody’s queries and do a performance evaluation based on where you perceive them to be. Pretty creepy. They’re using yesterday’s tools because of regulation and compliance, blowing an absurd amount of money. The CEO just sees a lot going out the door: “I thought these were supposed to save money, what’s going on here?” So his lieutenants have to get a grip on it, monitor everything. Even at Amazon this is being included in performance reviews, how much they’re using AI. That’s why if you’re a software developer wondering why your boss is on you about using AI tools. They’re probably getting pressure from their bosses. I want my engineers to be as productive as possible. I think AI is probably part of that tool belt for everyone at this point. But is tracking it really the best way? I’m going to gauge performance on metrics, how you interacted with the team, what you shipped. It puts the cart before the horse to say you’re paid by how much you use these AI tools. If I’m a developer, I’m just spinning up a script to send lorem ipsum text 24 hours a day, get maximum ratings because I used GPT-3.5 the most. MIT did a study in summer 2025. They’re saying 95% of companies report zero measurable ROI on AI products. Actually not that crazy if you consider that a lot of them did layoffs and subbed in AI. That’s just going according to plan in my estimation. They estimate about $30 to $40 billion has been spent on enterprise AI. That’s the money your JPMorgan Chase is spending for their engineers to use Claude Code or whatever dated tool they have access to. The market heard that signal. When that study came out: Nvidia crashed 3.5% Palantir down 10% Nasdaq in general down 1.2% That last one isn’t encouraging for an AI bubble pop because it indicates this is a big part of the economy. January through February: Maybe down valuations, just a very flat market without much growth. Q1 to Q2: We’ll start to see a couple businesses, or maybe one major one at first like a domino starting to fall, not able to raise capital at their 2025 valuation. We’ll see valuations go down. VCs will be like: “Not touching it, not giving them more money, cutting our losses.” Then timing a little more indeterminate but these things will happen quickly in succession: Credit markets start to tighten Debt refinancing pressure builds up in the system Nvidia revises its revenue guidance to something at least vaguely linked to reality And that’s when the big reckoning begins. I want to be clear. AI is not going anywhere. It’s going to continue being a mainstream part of the world. I like a lot of these tools, I think they’re very helpful. But the talking heads have really promised us the world. It’s clear the technology cannot deliver above and beyond what it’s doing now. We’ve seen progress of these models slow at an exponential rate of slowing over the past few releases. Each release is better, but the gap between the current release and the last release is much smaller than it used to be. Because of that, a lot of these AI companies are going to survive, but their valuations are going to get giga slashed. Valuations of $500 billion for OpenAI, $42 billion for Anthropic are unsustainable. We’re going to actually see them become unsustainable in 2026 as they’re eventually cut. Smaller companies will face those slashes first. But it’s coming for the major AI labs as well. This is good news, honestly. This AI hype has really turned tech into something different these days, different than it used to be. While I don’t feel AI is going anywhere, I do feel we’ll get a little more back to normal once this bubble pops and resolves. What do you think? Drop a comment below.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / tech_BG Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar fiscal fourth-quarter results earlier this month, with record revenue, beating analyst estimates. AI-driven growth powered the performance, yet the stock tumbled sharply afterward, dropping as much as 21% from $405 per share before the report to $321 per share in the following days. While Broadcom shares have since recovered some ground, they remain approximately 15% below their pre-earnings levels. This selloff is the result of a disconnect between strong fundamentals and the market’s reaction. There are three key reasons behind the decline in Broadcom stock, but these concerns open up an opportunity for investors to buy at a lower price. Broadcom reported net revenue of $18 billion for the period, a 28% increase from $14 billion a year earlier. Semiconductor solutions revenue reached $11.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, while infrastructure software contributed $6.9 billion, up 19%. AI semiconductor revenue was exceptionally strong, rising 74% year-over-year to $6.5 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.95 per share, up 37% from the year-ago quarter, with adjusted EBITDA at $12.1 billion, for margins of 68%, which was also 34% higher than last year, allowing Broadcom to generate a 36% increase in free cash flow to $7.5 billion. CEO Hock Tan highlighted the momentum, noting AI revenue growth drove the results. Broadcom also offered robust guidance for Q1, projecting revenue of $19.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year, with AI semiconductor revenue expected to double to $8.2 billion. Semiconductor revenue is forecast at about $12.3 billion, up 50%, underscoring continued demand acceleration. While AI-related order backlog of over $73 billion — deliverable over 18 months — was substantial, representing nearly half of the consolidated $162 billion backlog, was lower than anticipated for the pace of AI demand. This backlog includes custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking components like the Tomahawk 6 switch, with over $10 billion in orders for the latter alone. Management described bookings as “unprecedented” in recent months, but the specific backlog number contributed to perceptions of moderating momentum. Where gross margins were 77.9%, management said it expected a sequential decline of about 100 basis points in Q1 due to a higher mix of AI revenue, including passthrough costs in rack-level solutions. AI semiconductors, particularly custom chips and systems, carry lower margins than traditional products. Semiconductor gross margins are around 68%, compared to 93% for infrastructure software. As AI becomes a larger portion of revenue, this mix shift is expected to dilute overall margins slightly, even as absolute operating profit dollars grow. A third concern was the outlook for infrastructure software, primarily from VMware. Although segment revenue grew 19%, guidance called for low double-digit growth next year, with Q1 at $6.8 billion, only 2% higher year-over-year. This deceleration from prior rates raised questions about sustained momentum in the software segment, which has offered high-margin stability. Despite the stock’s tumble, Broadcom’s outlook remains robust, driven by accelerating AI demand that management describes as a multiyear trend. AI revenue is on track to double in Q1, fueled by custom accelerators and Ethernet networking. The company has also diversified its customer base, adding a fifth XPU client with a $1 billion initial order for delivery in late 2026, alongside follow-on commitments worth $11 billion from existing hyperscalers. Networking backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion, reflecting strong deployment needs. Moreover, bookings have surged recently, with visibility into leading-edge nodes and advanced packaging secured through facility expansions. Non-AI semiconductors remain stable, supported by a recovery in broadband. Broadcom continues to deliver strong capital returns, raising its dividend 10% and extending a $7.5 billion repurchase program. These factors point to sustained growth in 2026 and beyond. Broadcom is likely to surprise the market in future earnings reports with its strength, making the drop in its stock today the time to buy. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Tech layoffs in 2025: From TCS to Amazon — these IT firms laid off over 1,00,000 employees amid AI reshaping market

Amid artificial intelligence (AI) shaping the market, tech layoffs continue to hit workers across the world following a bruising year, in which over 100,000 people lost their jobs. Although the pace of layoffs has slowed slightly over the last few weeks, the impact remains significant, with around 122,549 tech workers being laid-off from 551 tech companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Some of the biggest pink slips came from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Salesforce, Amazon, and Microsoft — collectively affecting hundreds of employees. These job cuts are often linked to artificial intelligence, as companies are looking for ways to cut expenses amid rising costs from inflation and tariffs. In such times, hiring fewer employees and relying on AI can seem like an appealing short-term solution for companies. Several major tech companies have announced large scale of workforce reductions this year. Some notable examples of these layoffs include: — Amazon: The e-commerce giant announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history in October this year, slashing 14,000 corporate job roles, as it seeks to make more investments in its “biggest bets” which includes AI. — Microsoft: The US-based tech giant has cut a total of 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent restructuring announcement coming in July, which saw 9,000 employees losing their jobs. — TCS: India's largest tech company also joined the wave of companies laying off its employees. It announced a 2% reduction in its workforce, equating to nearly 12,000 jobs, which sent shockwaves to the country's IT industry. The company also refused claims that the job losses were due to AI replacement, citing skills mismatch and an evolving business model as the real reasons behind the move. — Intel: The chipmaker announced in July that it had mostly completed cutting 15% of its workforce. Intel had employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, with 99,500 of them classified as ‘core employees’. However, the chipmaker said that it wants to end the year with around 75,000 core employees. — Salesforce: The company's CEO Marc Benioff confirmed in September that 4,000 customer support workers had been cut at the firm with the help of AI. He had revealed over the summer that AI was already doing up to 50% of the work at the company. However, some recent news reports also indicate that alongside these cuts, Salesforce is also planning to hire more staff. — HP: In November, the PC maker said that it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs globally through fiscal 2028 as it aims to streamline operations and integrate artificial intelligence across workflows to speed up product development, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity. — Apple: According to a Bloomberg report, iPhone maker Apple has laid off dozens of sales workers across the United States in November, in a rare job cut for the tech giant. Although the exact number could not be verified. — Meta: As per news reports, Instagram's parent company Meta said in October that it plans to lay off 600 employees in its AI division, with the aim to build new products faster. — Google: The tech giant laid off 100 of its employees in design-related roles in October as part of its ongoing push to accelerate its AI agenda. A month earlier, the company had also reportedly cut more than 200 contractors working on its AI projects, including Gemini and AI Overviews. — Verizon: The US wireless carrier announced in November that it will lay off more than 13,000 employees marking its largest single job cut drive triggered by plans to shrink costs and restructure operations. — Siemens: The German tech firm cut 5,600 jobs at its Digital Industries business in March. The job cuts amount to a little more than 8% of the 68,000 people employed in Digital Industries globally.

And if the author was prepared to pay forty-four bucks for two of them, it just goes to show you that he has more dollars than sense. I’m hoping he made more than that for the article and can chalk it up as an expense. The author got paid for the article. It’s business expense. Re: Hainan The author of that tweet and substack doesn’t seem to understand that for the past 3 decades or so, every business that has sought to sell in China, manufactures in China. Importing has always been a fraught business for any company in China, there are just too many bureaucratic obstacles for anything except raw materials imports. The move to offshore to Vietnam, Indonesia, etc., has been driven by exporters from China, not companies wishing to sell in China. Since it’s just a customs free area for China, it will almost certainly only attract investments from companies already within China, and already selling within China. There may be good regional development reasons for this, but in terms of overall growth, its not likely to generate any real investment – this is why (for example), the Tories proposed Freeports around the UK went nowhere. Most likely, the justification is internal, specifically to complete the weakening of HK and Macau as economic powerhouses. Shanghai has already take up much of HK’s former financial role. There may also be a desire to create an alternative growth pole away from the traditional arc from the Yellow Sea to the Yangtze Delta. If it does indicate a strategic reset towards the western seaboard of China, then the Vietnamese in particular will be looking very closely at how to respond. Oddly enough, the best stats I could find from my neck of woods, only around 8% of the companies that export to China have a subsidiary there – the 92% manufacture somewhere else (mostly here). That is from 2023, so it indeed falls within the last three decades. Already over a decade ago I heard a comment by the CEO of Genelec that “one can’t compete with the Chinese in price, the secret is to make so good stuff the Chinese come and buy it regardless of the price”. “Trump tempers Zelensky’s optimism on peace plan The Hill” links to an Axios article. Here’s the correct link: https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5663887-trump-zelensky-peace-plan/ From the Axios article: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Axios on Friday that he hopes to agree on a framework with President Trump for ending the war when they meet on Sunday. Zelensky also revealed he’s willing to bring that plan up for a referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days” They just keep playing the “ceasefire” broken record as if the Russians are somehow gonna fall for it if they repeat it long enough. I imagine now that they need a ceasefire to hold the referendum. True brain geniuses in the British government these days. Thanks, fixing. I had considered linking to the Axios piece but its headline claim was bogus. Mercouris has already picked apart Zelensky’s offer that Axios depicted as new (adding the “60 day” specifier does not change the basic idea). “Have Germans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?” The answer is probably no as German media is all in on the propaganda effort and everything that Germans say online is being watched like a hawk with punishment meted out from time to time. Plus alternate views are banned in Germany and the EU such as the Russian RT & Sputnik. I mean here, you may as well ask ‘Have Americans finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ or ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise?’ The answers to both questions would also apply to the Germans. Rev Kev: ‘Have the British finally had enough of propaganda sold as expertise.’ Actually, the majority have, I’d guess. The problem is the media and TPTB relentlessly keep shoveling the sh*t to allow no break in the narrative. such as the Russian RT I’m typing this in a hotel room in Munich. No problem getting RT. You are blessed, channels such as press tv,russia today have been removed from circulation in my tiny and toney part of the collective west. When I’ve visited in Deutschland, MSNBC and Bloomberg are the only english language options. Their view of the world rarely chimes with my experience or understanding of it. Slop did not start with the AI con. That’s an odd one that. Back in 2022 the EU banned RT & Sputnik for “disinformation”- https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-bans-rt-sputnik-banned-over-ukraine-disinformation-2022-03-02/ And yet a 2024 article states that in many EU countries you can still get them. Then again the European parliament wants to ban them from its IT infrastructure as of a few months ago. So maybe a rule more honoured in the breach sort of situation? Indi Samarajiva, at it again. They Corrupt and Call It Peace. Or, they are corrupt and what they deign to offer as peace is rotten. An observation well known in Europe (although not acknowledged by most of the media outlets): “Von der Leyen failed upwards by A) doing corrupt defense deals on her phone and deleting evidence in Germany B) doing corrupt vaccine deals on her phone and deleting evidence for the EU. What mere mortals would consider ruinous scandals are really just a successful job application within White Empire.” What Indi Samarajiva reports has been covered here at Naked Capitalism, but you should read the essay because it is compact, well argued, and spicy indeed. Oreshniks to Belarus — https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1221212/possible-oreshnik-deployment-in-belarus/ Not unexpected, of course. Of the two authors here, back when I was doing journalism I used Lewis as a source and my sense was, while he’d no technical knowledge (degrees in policy and philosophy bs) as long as he was backed up/fronting for a technical person) he was sort of okay. He has a technical person as a co-author here. The British tabloid press is soberly reporting on all this, of course– Russia moves terrifying hypersonic nuclear missiles closer to UK in WW3 terror https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2150812/russia-moves-terrifying-hypersonic-nuclear-missiles TBF, the Daily Express also reported last week that Russian troops were forced to eat each other as they were not being supplied with food. https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2148914/putins-desperate-troops-so-short The Express is probably the worst of the rabid right wing British tabloids. Take whatever they report and how they frame reporting with a bushel of salt rather than a pinch. Pavel Podvig relating to Lewis´s post: Oreshnik in Belarus? There are reasons to be skeptical https://russianforces.substack.com/p/oreshnik-in-belarus Podvig posted the only comment under the Lewis post btw. p.s. However I am not sure any more what to think about Lewis…his proximity to Dems. is odd and out of place. Am always suspecting he downplays or overplays things depending on what may be fitting ideology best. Just like the last paragraph: “(…) impending deployment of Typhon to Germany, and possible future deployments of Dark Eagle (…) Although these systems are purely conventional, Putin has raised the prospect that they could be converted to nuclear-armed systems that could decapitate the Russian leadership in Moscow. This is precisely what he is now doing, by placing Oreshnik in Belarus. (…)” Right! Because Belarus is bordering to Virginia. I didnt´know that. “Why Does the West Hate Russia?” I’m not sure what is to be done here. This hatred goes back at least two centuries and is firmly embedded in the EU countries especially the Baltic States. It is even worse in the UK but mostly in the political elite who are rabid over the subject of Russia. And through emigration, these hatreds have made their may across the Atlantic and has found fertile ground in Washington DC. Victoria Nuland may be an example here. I’m not sure how you dig your way out of this hatred which right now is warping the policies of many western countries to the point that they are destroying their own country in a vague hope of destroying Russia. I don’t know if the Sachs essay that was linked there has been in the NC links but it’s a very good read. I learned a few things, especially about the machinations on German neutrality and eventual rearmament in the 1950s. https://consortiumnews.com/2025/12/24/jeffery-sachs-two-centuries-of-russophobia-rejection-of-peace/ My view of Adenauer is diminished, not that I had any belief that he was a great statesman. It’s too bad that Sachs didn’t get into the Sino-Soviet split, De Gaulle recognizing the PRC, Nixon going to China, etc. I always wonder how much Russophobic treachery was involved in those events. Fascinating stuff. Hate is a strong word. I’d call it a healthy distrust. My ancestors have dealt with several Russian invasions. I do not doubt that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again someday. If the Baltics keep cozying up to the corrupt US and Western Europe and promoting warmongering crazies like Kaja Kallas, you prophecy will no doubt become true. Yes, calling Russians “orcs” and Russia “Mordor” is healthy, humanizing and perfectly normal way to express distrust 🥲 And as Sachs points out, Russia has many reasons for holding a “healthy distrust” of Europe. But I’m curious. When you say you “do not doubt” that Russia will try to invade Eastern Europe again, on what is this certainty based? The past? Because I have seen no evidence whatsoever of this likelihood after the fall of the Soviet Union, and (as Sachs also points out) much evidence of Russia’s desire for European integration. On the other hand, Russian fears of invasion by the West were reinforced by US/NATO actions almost immediately after the Soviet collapse, and continue to be. I’m not naive. I’m not trying to whitewash past Russian actions, and I understand the effects on historical memory and prejudice. But I honestly cannot see the evidence for such fears of some new Russian imperialist expansion. I am honestly interested in what such evidence might be. Especially since, as I say, there is plenty of reason for Russia to fear the West. “Invade” is a dodgy concept these days. Note that Kaja Kallas included, iirc, 1944 among her “Russian invasions.” I’m not so naive as to believe Russia does not “invade” in general, but they tend to be “defensive” in nature, afaict, such that potential invaders can generally avert by playing diplomacy carefully (see Cold War Finland, and, to a lesser degree, most of the Eastern Bloc–Of course, how much room the countries on the other hand might be quite limited and Russians might not give them too much leash–eg Czechoslovakia in 1968. But such interventions strike me as both more complex than mere “invasions” and not particularly unusual in Great Power-Small Power politics, unpleasant though they might be.) In the real world, attitudes toward Russia differ wildly across Eastern Europe. Usually, but not always, this follows the Orthodox/Western Christianity line of demarcation, but for instance in Slovakia national identity is historically bound up with pan-Slavism and hence Russia. “Eastern Europeans all hate and fear Russia” is just propaganda. Usually the people who say this are from the Baltics, Romania, or Western Ukraine, where it is coupled with an idea that “we are defending Europe from the Asians,” which I suspect (I 100% know in the case of WU) is linked to their past as allies of Germany in WW2. Ally of Germany carries a lot of water for a Romanian. The first to snatch a piece from the territory of Greater Romania was Germany, to pay upfront Hungary as a future ally. Then it allowed USSR to take Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940. Romania joined Germany in order to recover those territories lost because of Germany. And then it changed sides and regained Northern Transylvania… With allies like Germany… n=1 but….A very good friend, Polish, opened Dun & Bradstreet’s office in Moscow in 1994. She got on swimmingly with the Russians. But she was not a typical Pole. Among other things, her family harbored Jews during WWII. Russia is the biggest part of Eastern Europe (and used to be much bigger), so your prophecy is true by default. As a matter of fact they are invading Eastern Europe as we speak. Nostradamus stuff indeed. Also. it’s funny that you fail to give any deatils of your ancestors, and their dealings with all those unprovoked full-scale invasions. Reminds me of a recently erect memorial in Canada, that had to blank the names of the “victims”. My Lithuanian ancestors invaded Russia and occupied some of it for almost 2 centuries. I have no doubt the Balts, Poles, Germans along with their western European allies aspire to control Russia again. My deceased elders and Lithuanian relatives HATE Russia and Russians; nothing healthy about that. They have a KKK and Nazi mentality. This goes back to the schism. In Bulgaria (Eastern Orthodox) there is a distinct subset of people with Russia Derangement Syndrome that borders on clinical pathology. There’s no informed argument to be had with them, everyone who exhibits even a mild doubt as to the immaculate blamelessness of the West for the war is automatically labeled a Putinist. Which is kind of funny, considering that they bring up historical grievances going even further back in history than Putin. That is kind of odd, given that it was largely the Russian army that created the independent (in practice, at least) Bulgaria. Well, their answer for that is that Russia didn’t do it out of pure altruism. Which is at least partly the case, but these are creatures wedded to moral absolutism towards others, if only rarely willing to acknowledge their own failings in the morality department. People seem to forget – social networks – especial the haves at a given moment in time “that perceive” a loss of status – ???? [waves@Ayn Rand sorts] – be it power too shape reality or material wealth … don’t go poof when one age cohort expires … its passed down as environmental bias e.g. this whole world is full of peoples[tm] that at one time were BSD and then poof … I think Toynbee was correct about the basic 3 levels of any society. In saying that I had some fun with my Samsung TV a few years ago as it had a Samsung channel that depicted early European/Asia&Minor history. Used to speed it up and the contracts made and broken between ruling classes was Epic … so much cannon fodder … Yes, partly it’s the perceived loss of status by the “landed gentry” (given Ottoman rule, they became landed and propertied by way of scammery, thievery and thuggery after independence, often legitimizing their gains by supporting the anti-Russian governments after Reunification). It’s little wonder that that the most vociferous russophobia one encounters is from members of the so-called “restitute class”, whose restored properties in choice locations in and around Sofia make them a genuine rentier class exuding a sense of superiority that’s backed by little else other than having inherited said properties. Oh, yeah, Russians invaded Bulgaria in 1877, who can forget that unprovoked invasion… It’s a bit more complicated than that, going back to revolutionary activities prior to the war and some less than helpful Russian imperial meddling in the revolutionary organizing. That’s what empires do, but these fine “history truthers” conveniently turn blind eye to anti-Bulgarian German, Austrian, British and French meddling at that period, as it would force them to enter the realm of Realism. They prefer to inhabit the much more gratifying realm of hypocritical morality posturing on the so-called “European values,” which would be great if they were ever actually applied in practice… Old Sam Huntington and his Clash of Civilizations. The map in the linked page shows that fault line. Huntington really lost marbles with the Clash of Civilizations, IMHO. For the great powers, there is something there, although not quite for the reasons that he thinks. For the lesser powers, he’s completely off–countries like South Korea and Vietnam might belong to the same “civilization” as China, but that actually furthers the ambiguity, not lessens it (Taiwan, which is actually “Chinese” illustrates the problem better, in fact. For that matter, why is Japan of a different “civilization” from China?). The problem with Huntington’s glib thinking is that “civilization” as a political identity is a mushy concept, semi-artificially created and maintained. That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant. (Japanese imperial propaganda in Korea between 1910 and 1945 provide lots of examples that both work, fall flat on their face, and were the former but are officially remembered today as the latter–and these are countries with a lot of historical baggage both positive and negative, notwithstanding Huntington’s ignorance.). It goes a lot deeper than the simpleminded “civilizations.” (Unless you have discovered the Republic and Gunpowder?) “really lost marbles” is putting it midly. Sorry for being not very sophisticated but studying political science is like studying BS. And on top of that his life reads like piling even more of that cluelessness: Brzezinski, National Security Council, Trilateral Commission? The fact that he made this career and is still known sheds no good light on the intellectual culture. At.all. “That countries X and Y are of the same “civilization,” or even historical affinity, doesn’t mean that they would be automatically drawn to each other without a lot of “propaganda” that people would find credible under circumstances where they are relevant.” Exactly. I thought this would be self-evident today. But hell was I wrong. It’s been 30 years since I read Huntington and more than 50 since he read me, but I’ll undertake a partial defense. The book came out in the 90s as the Soviet Union collapsed and Fukuyama was ready to declare “game over.” Huntington steps up and says, “No, there will not be a Pax Americana or even a Pax Neoliberal. Instead, the old pattern of rivalries. along the fracture lines of language, religion and culture, will resume. One group that certainly took this seriously are the neocons, who have spent the last 30 years trying to exploit these fissures, especially in the Balkans and the Caucasus, and they’ve been pretty successful at making trouble. I know Huntington had been thinking along these lines since the mid-70s not because I had read anything of his or taken a course from him, but because he turned up as a surprise reader of my senior thesis. The subject matter was how would the arrival of lots of suburban, Republican voters in formerly Dixiecrat rural counties affect the level of political activity and participation, in other words, a mild clash of civilizations. So I think he deserves credit for having a more accurate idea of where we were headed than those who thought the end of the Cold War would end or at least greatly decrease international violence. You may be right that the “civilization” concept is mushy, and that Huntington’s analysis of the Far East is weak, but he sure seems to have gotten a lot of things right as upstater confirms with his assertion that the acrimony between Poland and the Baltics on the the one side and Russia on the other goes back to the Great Schism. Thanks for this account. I don´t want to disregard any scholar´s insight just because I do not concur with the politics behind it. But it frankly appears to me that what you did was analyze after the fact and come to a conclusion. Just what science does. Huntington on the other hand got invovled into creating a situation first which only caused the crisis. And then he was doing scholarly work about that very crisis as if it had already been in place – without any interference and assistance from his own “people” and his own ideas (“inspired” by your work in this example). I am not the expert so please forgive my superficial take: In the Arab world I often understood that, again simplified, radical Islam of the 1980s was the response to the demise of left/Communist/nationalist movements. So latter had to be destroyed first as they withstood Western imperial interests. And only when in the wake of the destruction of civil society the “healthy” fabric disintegrated would former – radical Islam – find the fertile ground and the space to take over (with a lot of help from us.) And eventually after supporting those circles of the US that had been responsible for this shift in the Middle East would Huntington come up and present his “scholarship”. It almost sounds as if he turned things upside down. (I know this is a bit exaggerated. But I hope the essence of my simple point comes across. And I assume that he probably didn´t even realize his hand in all this to some extent.) p.s. Maybe some remember the Danish caricature scandal: 20 years ago Jyllands-Posten published provocative caricatures about Muhammad. Expecting outrage. However initially there was no such reaction by the Muslim communities at all. So the editors actually sent the pictures to Muslim communities explicitly. But those again responded very relaxed and stated it didn´t really bother them. Only after these disappointing reactions did the paper force it and other papers took it up, I believe French outlets in particular. I don´t exactly remember the chronology then but I do know that almost nobody was interested in how this affair had actually started. So what happened the paper had created a scandal to sell its product. Plain and simple. And then swapped cause and effect. Oh, and nonetheless this once huge scandal has been completely forgotten. I do not believe that people hate. And elites work really really hard to bring about this hatred. And people like Huntington are part of that. In whatever twisted ways. But classic, clear-minded, honest scholarship – IMHO – never gets invovled with the politcs of the subjects it researches. Sorry for the length. I think the problem with Huntington was that he was purporting to write about the future of international order, not internal dynamics of politics within great powers. If his argument were only that great powers would seek to orient themselves around a common sense of shared civilization, that would be correct to a large degree, but that was not his primary claim. This, incidentally, is a very old critique of Huntington–that nations do not have allegiance towards allegedly shared civilizations. It came out almost as soon as the Huntington essay came out in Foreign Affairs (that was a long while before the book, I think.). Neighboring countries often share civilizations. They also have more shared interests and conflicts. These trump whatever civilizational affinity there is. They would rather align with “alien” civilization against their neighbor, or, at least, hedge their bets, which create seemingly “counter civilizational” motives. The Lithuanians I actually know express opinions on the full range as regards our neighbor-to-the-west-and-east. Not ten years ago, we were the only of the three Baltics not to have an organic anti-russian movement of any significance whatsoever. The intervening decade of influence operations against us is starting to show results, sadly. Latvians and Estonians are indeed kind of psychos. Locally, and in our drinks, it is theorized the same might have become of us if we had also allowed ourselves to be colonized and ruled by the Crusader orders. That kind of influence has to leave a mark. But “Baltics” is (weirdly) an overbroad category… The “Lithuanians” cultivated for decades in the US, UK, and Canada as weapons against Teh Commiez, on the other hand? Nazis to the core. I do remember that there were Lavian and Estonian volunteer SS divisions, but not a Lithuanian one (heck, Estonia probably raised more SS troops per capita than any other country…) Russian invasions? Most likely the arc of Russian invasions, in an active way, moved mostly east and south. In the west was in fact a scramble between empires. I.e. Bulgarians, Romanians cannot claim of being invaded by Russians, when the fights were just on their territories btw Russians and Ottomans or Austrians, Swedes, etc… There’s a pretty fundamental difference between invasion and liberation. FWIW, growing up in the U.S. during the Cold War, I and most people I met didn’t hate the Russians/Soviets. The usual take was “They’re good people with a bad government”. When later I met some people from the Soviet Union, that was their take on the U.S. This may have just been naive why-can’t-we-all-get-along-ism but I never encountered the kind of poisonous hatred other commenters are describing. The dehumanizing rhetoric in Europe must be witnessed to be believed. What we in the US would call ‘hate speech’ is fully normalized with respect to Russia and Russians, especially in former Axis allies. It was funny when my Dad who grew up in Hungary met a US Vietnam Veteran Dad, in the US. I had to translate but both had been raised with stories about how evil the other army had been. Fun memory: “thwarting Cold War fairy-tales with a lot of beer.” Dad found it really odd that you weren´t allowed to buy booze on Sundays in the bible belt. So the first time he went to the cashier and filled the cart with the finest bottles you can imagine. Until he was denied the purchase. I had to interfere and calm him down since he caused a ruckus and cursing – fortunately – in Hungarian. Which is quite bad. But few understand it. Travelled from one end of Russia to the other in the late 90s. Folks were always friendly to Americans. “You’ve never killed us.” Many of my companions were Germans and on rare occasions bitterness toward Germany from the 1940s did come up. Just absorbing what one does in general media and education, I always thought of Lithuania as one of the three Baltic tinies. I was surprised to find out that it is a former great power. Re. “Both of these influencers…” The “precious metals” sphere has had the emergence of an AI oriental looking “presenter” giving a series of very slick programs highlighting the “doomed” nature of the metals markets as presently constituted. On the “original” metals vlogs this “character” is jokingly referred to as AI Man, and yet the information “he” presents is seriously debated. The ultimate agenda of whoever is behind AI Man is still murky at best. This highlights what is possibly the greatest danger from this AI People phenomenon, the very effective value of well made AI programing as propaganda. When everybody accepts “unreality” as the new normal… I am now waiting for the emergence of AI Politicos. We call Politicos ‘fakes’ already. What’s to stop the power elites from taking that idea to its logical extreme? Stay safe. Practice your pattern recognition skills. God forbid that this does not eventually lead to a whole bunch of AI Ben Shapiros, each tailor made to a specific audience but combined creating a political movement. My initial defense to this is to stick to Youtube channels I know. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the feed is filling up with these AI fakes. The other day, I made the mistake of clicking on what I thought was Mercouris. After a minute or so, I knew it wasn’t Alexander because there was no nose-picking and no stuttering. I’ve seen fake Wilkersons, MacGregors and lots of Mearsheimers. Usually, these fakes are making outrageous claims, discrediting these commentators to people who aren’t cautious. Crazy world. We’re getting to the point where your assumption has to be any channel created after 2026-01-01 has a >50% chance of being fake or some form of astroturf. The fake-AI Bob Barker insult comedy videos make me laugh though, lmao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPitD1eYLiM Having the same experiences that you have had. It’s bad enough when YouTube keeps on shoving adds into those videos and you can see that the “presenter” is actually an AI. Hint – it’s hard for a human to talk and have a big smile on their face at the same time but that is how you pick an AI person. Best to stick to their official channels I guess. It seems that the real Mercouris, MacGregor, and Mearsheimer could file complaints with YouTube and report these channels. And per YT policy they should be taken down, just like YT took down channels spreading COVID “misinformation.” I won’t hold my breath, though. Especially because all of the real McCoys are engaged in truth telling that inconveniences the narrative that narrative makers want us to buy. Perhaps this is a deliberate move from the narrative makers to discredit alt-media and make it more difficult for them to get their message out. For one thing, it could easily affect traffic and revenue. Surely these commentators are aware this is happening. I’d like to hear them address how they’re trying to deal with this and the extent to which Youtube is cooperating. Mercouris has talked about doing that fair bit, but it seems that YT has not been as responsive as he’d have liked. (Although fake Mercouris seems rarer than others) I actively report such channels – at this point easy to spot, and block them from my feed. Hopefully if a large number of viewers do so, also, they will disappear (for the time being). We had friends and neighbors over for dinner during the Holidays. One of these families has a 22 year old young man who is quite frankly movie star handsome and is very bright. There were other kids his age here at the same time. It came up in conversation that ANY and ALL texts, emails, etc he receives with any possible dating partner are sent through AI services to a) have a full profile of the possible partner’s mental health and motivations and b) to assess their compatibility with him. Again, in my day, this would not have been a young man who would have had any problems attracting women and furthermore all of the above issues he is sending to AI would have been talked out with his closest friends. Now we ditch the friends, the locker rooms, the bar, the basketball court and hand everything over to Grok or chat GPT. What really concerned me is that every person in my house between 18-30 or so that evening informed us all that they do exactly the same thing. AI screening of all potential dates, partners, etc. This was new to me and I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. We are removing humanity from every single interaction we have. I fear for these kids when they are 50. But the other very concerning issue is that all texts, emails, any correspondence at all that has our individual names, email addresses, phone numbers, whatever are being sent to AI companies to be analyzed. And we have zero idea this is even being done. You can avoid it all you want in your life, but it is becoming increasingly clear that AI has no intention at all of avoiding you. Please, anyone, help me find a bright spot here. Do you think this is a truly representative experience for the US or rather fringe? Bright spot? Not bright: But maybe things happening later in their lives which will render this new way of connecting less attractive. Life has a way of messing things up, doesn´t it? As they say in German: “Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt”/”Man proposes, God disposes.” (I assume the idea of a “ghost in the machine” too is related to the chaos-oriented hope that not all can be planned and manipulated incessently in an AI-controlled society.) Sometimes you have to dodge people walking down the street who are staring at their phones. Re Doc’s tale presumably any kid who is off the electronic grid never gets a date–the new definition of a wallflower. Filmmaker John Hughes would have made much of this. Ned Ludd would not have been on any social media. The “moderne” habits of social media use are quite understandable if viewed through the lens of conformism as a social organizing strategy. Being in the world but not of it is very hard. I try and generally fail in that endeavour. However, I continue trying. The main point about any of the so called AIs we encounter is that they are simple tools for others. A computer program has no agency. As the Late Lamented Lambert remarked, code is law. Learn who or what lies behind an AI and you are half way to mastering said AI. As for the use of AIs in general; I have noticed that many people are prone to searching out the “easy way” to accomplish difficult tasks. Thinking is hard. It takes will power to ‘buckle down’ and do the hard work when a supposedly “easy” fix is available. I too fear for the younger cohorts. They will eventually encounter problems that AIs cannot fix for them. Then the lack of skills and training will cripple them in the face of their problems. I fear I am becoming trite, but this is nothing really new. The problems of laziness and lack of skill acquisition are perennial. Today, with the “help” of high tech, those problems have become automated, at scale. As the “adults” in the room, so to speak, our task is the difficult one of finding those of the younger cohorts who can be helped and are willing to try. We are now entering a period of Social Triage. Stay safe, strong and resilient. A friend who has a Gen Z co-worker reported the following… Gen Z co-worker wanted to use ChatGPT to resolve a customer issue. Friend: “no, we shouldn’t do that.” Co-worker admitted to probably relying on ChatGT too much, but at least wasn’t as bad as co-worker’s partner, who evidently wears ear buds and has an AI app listen to all conversations with other humans. In conversation with others, this person just waits, listens to the earbuds to be told what to say by the AI, and then responds. So…. You ready to do a Butlerian Jihad now, Doc? 😉 3 tomahawks failed to explode out of 12? That’s pretty bad pic.twitter.com/OivQCQ70DD — Lord Bebo (@MyLordBebo) December 27, 2025 Who’s cleaning the mess up? Are those only going to lay there to be photographed? And another speculation crossed my mind that may be wild to mention. Those two lying on flat ground have been put there gently, so someone is already doing some cleaning. I don’t what is worse: Lord Bebo passing off AI slop as real or people on this site falling for it. We were overdue for a feral hog story. Excellent timing! For a shorter summary of the Epstein history, see the Doug Ross item. Thank you for the link which I have bookmarked. I am three hours through the four hour Mike Benz broadcast that was in today’s links. Except for an explanation of Epstein’s entre into Bear Stearns, that link can be skipped up to about the 50 minute part (Yadda-yadda). As this outline suggests, Benz highlights many points at which Epstein’s life intersects with some very interesting characters involved in some very significant “deep history” events. At minimum he provides reasons to take the Epstein case seriously rather than write it off as simply the sensationalized actions of a “lone pervert” or (as with the NY Times) just a con-man ripping off poor unsuspecting billionaires. A lot of this is being covered in the on-going work of Ryan Grim and Drop Site News. And almost all of it has been covered earlier by Whitney Webb, who continues to be ignored by the mainstream press but also gets shafted by a lot of the alt media. I’ve been very cautious about Benz. He was a sketchy anonymous right-wing “influencer” before he suddenly exploded all over the internet as a former State Department employee and supposed intelligence expert. But much of what he says does ring true and correspond with other sources. That link is great. Also confirms my priors. I had long thought and sometimes said that Epstein was most likely an arms dealer. That is hugely lucrative. Looks like he was broadly involved in that nexus. On the name change to the Trump-Kennedy Center, it’s worth noting that the original name is The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center. A “Memorial” refers to how a society honors someone who is already dead. I doubt Trump realizes adding his name makes no sense. Second, Trump is not adding his name or building monuments to himself because he has a big ego. Rather, he knows deep down how incompetent and weak he truly is. And he spends enormous energy hiding that fact. For this reason, he realizes that when he dies nobody is going to build anything in honor to him. Or he’s just messing with people. It used to be hard to guess which part of Trump was shtick. Nowadays he seems genuinely gaga. A headstone?

Becoming a billionaire rarely involves doing what’s right. Forgive me for asking again but what are the best alternatives for using YT? I have no YT account but some channels like Pascal Lottaz are only on YT and sometimes I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. So I stopped watching. There were ad-free YT-alternatives but those disappeared and the most recent comments about the existing YT alternatives mentioned on NC recently I forgot to bookmark. I can´t click away the ads since I am not at my desk which makes it in part impossible to listen. A wireless mouse could be one solution? I download everything I want to watch. Then watch at my own leisure, including fast forwarding and rewinding. No ads. Works on 90% of stuff out there. Then, delete to free the disk space. How do you download things? I had WonderShare for years but the algorithm changes and now I need to upgrade. Which I haven’t been able to do. media-downloader https://github.com/mhogomchungu/media-downloader I use Any Video Converter Ultimate. Free download. You just have to get a slightly older version, some 2-3 years old. Works with w10 and w11. Video Download Helper extension on Firefox works well but those more savvy than me can discuss whether the permissions make it a spybot. Firefox does offer tracking protections that may block. I never use Chrome or Safari. If you want to watch YouTube on your phone, I have heard good things about Newpipe, though I haven’t tried it myself yet. If you want an alternative site, some youtubers cross-post to Rumble, so depending on what channels you want to watch, they may already be there. Rumble is newer, so not as enshittifide yet. I use Newpipe on Android with excellent results. No ads. Download features available On desktop I use Firefox browser with the YouTube ad block extension. Also works excellently. Can’t download, but no ads. It also works with a YT account without issues. Both the above work without a YT account. If i am understanding the problem correctly. You can use the FireFox browser to watch programs like “Neutrality Studies” ad free once you install an ad blocker like “ublock Orgin” . Setting -> Extentions and Themes Then search ublock under addons Brave browser blocks utube ads by default and allows background play on android. I’m a hard-core IT nerd so I use a technique not available to most: I use the ‘yt-dlp’ program to download videos, mostly from video-game playthroughs, and watch those on a flash drive plugged into my TV. I also download long music videos for video game soundtracks, turn those into MP3 files, and play them on my phone. As part of the soundtrack project I use a program that I wrote 30 years ago and made open-source. So… not a normal responder. Youtube has lately been playing ‘arms race’ with the downloader apps, and I don’t know if they still work. Cheers, and good luck! As a medium-hardness-core IT nerd, I use 9xbuddy.com, savefrom.net, and invidio.us. The first one works on bunch of sites. FreeTube app. All ads defeated. Excellent. Thanks for the help to everyone!!! I guess I figure out the best solution. And I will bookmark this now. I don’t have a YT account so I do not understand your issue. And I watch a LOT of YT. If you use the Orion browser, it blocks YT ads. But sometime the video freezes as a result of the ad blocking and you have to restart (but it will resume where it stopped). I had a lot of ads during shows like Neutrality Studies. Every 3-5 minutes. It became impossible to listen to especially when I am not near the computer to click it away. But Lottaz is an important source. As is Patrik Baab. And several others. So I try to solve it. Pardon selling……Does no one remember Marc Rich? https://www.brookings.edu/articles/bill-clintons-last-outrage-the-presidents-defenders-feel-betrayed-by-his-pardon-of-marc-rich/ The Dhammacetiya Buddhist group is having their Walk for Peace from Fort Worth Texas to Washington DC. The group of monks has recently entered LaGrange, Georgia. Their website has a daily map, and their Facebook page has a live map. Local news stations along the path have had stories of the monks. “Photos show California slammed with heavy rain, mudslides from storm” Between the floods, the fires and the earthquakes, you sometimes wonder if California hates people and is trying to kill them off. Nah, since half the state doesn’t have seasons, earthquakes, fires, floods, and riots become our seasons. Apropos of nothing this is interesting. https://www.openculture.com/2025/12/what-pompeii-looked-like-hours-before-its-destruction-a-reconstruction.html The Pompeii/Herculaneum archaeology have been really useful because the high-class Romans who wrote all of the scrolls did not care about how everyday life worked. For example, they dug up a two-story-high wooden wheel that they used to do construction work. We had no idea! Also, the wine shops had murals that look exactly like 1970s Napa wine country graphic design. I grew up in Northern California in the 70s, marinated in that stuff. re: In 2026, Will Americans Finally Turn Against Oligarchs? -Matt Stoller Thanks for the link. A must read, imo. Lol the so called left would never even consider withholding voters It began when Cuban American lawmakers pressed Mr. Trump early this year to end Chevron’s Biden-era confidential license. After Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio announced in late February that they would do so, Mr. Maduro stopped accepting deportation flights of Venezuelans. Mr. Maduro had agreed to them on Jan. 31 with Richard Grenell, a special envoy for Mr. Trump. Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, lobbied the administration for a license extension, speaking to Mr. Trump several times over the coming months. The Cuban American lawmakers got wind that the license could be extended, and they threatened to withhold their votes for Mr. Trump’s signature legislation, “the One Big Beautiful Bill.” At the Oval Office meeting in late May, Mr. Trump told Mr. Rubio and Mr. Miller that he needed to get the bill passed. But he said he had heard about the downsides of ending the license, including that Chinese companies would take over Chevron’s stakes, said an official. The president demanded options. That was when Mr. Miller offered to help. He had been nurturing his ideas for mass deportations and boat strikes. Mr. Trump did not renew Chevron’s license when it expired on May 27. His domestic policy bill passed Congress five weeks later. https://archive.ph/pnWpI How Oil, Drugs and Immigration Fueled Trump’s Venezuela Campaign re: Zionism as cult 10 min. with Katie Halper and Russell Dobular https://scheerpost.com/2025/12/27/zionism-scientology-and-the-cult-mentality-no-one-talks-about/ This story from the London Times, Sunday edition in 2023 sheds some new light for me on what’s happened to the UK Labour Party and the rise of Starmer.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.) Allee Errico’s pages in Bernadette #2 9.) Pleasure Beach #1 by Josh Pettinger 8.) Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan 7.) Flea by Mara Ramirez 6.) Christine by Cyril Vilks 5.) Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics. You and Me on Repeat by Mary Shyne, published by Henry Holt. The Horrors of Being a Human by Desmond Reed, published by Microcosm Publishing. Tuck Everlasting: The Graphic Novel by K. Woodman-Maynard, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This Beautiful Ridiculous City by Kay Sohini, published by Ten Speed Press. Raised by Ghosts by Briana Loewinsohn, published by Fantagraphics. Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb, published by Fantagraphics. Raymond Chandler’s Trouble is My Business by Arvind Ethan David & Ilias Kyriazis, published by Pantheon. The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing. Best Digital Comic — C’mon: it’s the 21st century and this category is totally irrelevant.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy.

Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.)

Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics. You and Me on Repeat by Mary Shyne, published by Henry Holt. The Horrors of Being a Human by Desmond Reed, published by Microcosm Publishing. Tuck Everlasting: The Graphic Novel by K. Woodman-Maynard, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This Beautiful Ridiculous City by Kay Sohini, published by Ten Speed Press. Raised by Ghosts by Briana Loewinsohn, published by Fantagraphics. Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb, published by Fantagraphics. Raymond Chandler’s Trouble is My Business by Arvind Ethan David & Ilias Kyriazis, published by Pantheon. The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Glenn Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1.

An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Try from €1.50 / week Try from €1.50 / week €1 in every €7 earned in Ireland is now being saved by households, underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. Irish households are saving money at a rate not seen since the pandemic-induced highs of the early 2020s with recent data showing the savings rate hitting the highest levels since the middle of 2022. However, much of that money languishes in deposit accounts which offer little in the way of returns for customers as inflation erodes its value. Recently released figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows that Irish households are continuing to add to their deposit accounts with the savings rate rising to almost 15% between July and September, up 2% from the previous quarter. The current savings rate is also notably above the average of 13.1% since the beginning of 2023. It said that €1 in €7 is now being saved by households, which is being underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. According to data from the Central Bank of Ireland, as of the end of October, the total value of household deposits stood at €170.3bn marking the first time in the history of the data series that this figure surpassed €170bn - an increase of €2bn compared to September and an increase of €11.3bn in the year to the end of October. Even though all categories had a positive contribution, overnight deposits - which is money largely kept in current accounts - was the main driver, reporting a positive flow of €1.9bn during the month. The CSO said that savings can add to a household's overall wealth in the form of buying new homes, growing bank deposits, pension savings, and paying off debt. Managing director of Cork-based financial planning firm Alpha Wealth Nick Charalambous said the reality is a lot of Irish depositors are “getting next to zero interest” on their savings with inflation eroding its value over time. "Don't leave your money sitting dormant in the banks, the post office, credit unions,” he said. Financial planner with Castle Capital Colum Carroll said inflation is the “real killer” of wealth and investing money, whether it be through a pension or other mechanisms, allows people to plan better for the future. "People often see investments as being risky, but I think the narrative kind of needs to change around that again…Not investing can actually be even more risky. The risk of running out of money, the risk of not having enough money in the future, or losing purchasing power. They're the kind of real risks,” he said. Mr Charalambous said a part of the reason for people keeping money on deposit or in savings is the fear of losing it and maybe a lack of understanding of the options that are out there for people to make their money work harder particularly over the medium to long term. When looking into what to do with all their savings, Mr Charalambous said households should consider the timeframe for when they need the savings as this will dictate the appropriate financial vehicle. In the short-term, which would be three years or less, he says that money should be kept on deposit. "Most of us are now used to using Revolut. With their introduction of savings and deposit rates as well as investment accounts, there are millions upon millions of euros going into those types of savings,” he said, however, there are better returns offered by other non-Irish entities. “Raisin would be my preferred one, and the main reason for that is that they use physical banks. With Raisin you can get a sort of a three month starter rate with Raisin themselves who are triple a rated institution at 3.1% gross, and typically the demand deposit rates with Raisin are in and around 2.15%,” he said. After covering expenses and managing savings for the short-term, Mr Charalambous said people should be prioritising longer-term investments such as a pension. "Unfortunately, we all live in the here and now, and it's very difficult for us to kind of visualize a scenario where we are basically benefiting from building up this very tax efficient investment vehicle, which is a pension,” he said. In the medium term, which would be four years or longer, Mr Charalambous said there are investment options from the likes of Irish Life, Aviva, and Zurich which offer “very broad investment solutions”. Mr Charalambous said all investments should be reviewed at least once a year. Given the growth of Revolut, along with other financial applications, people have become a lot more familiar with investing themselves in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In these apps, people can choose to manage their own investments with the money being easily accessible should the customer need to make a withdrawal. However, Mr Charalambous warned that the options often offered in these apps are very concentrated and largely dependent on US stock markets. "The Vanguard S&P 500 as an example, is the most common ETF globally, where most people start with and put too much exposure to. But it's a very narrow fund, because it's concentrated purely in the US, solely in 500 companies,” he said, adding that it is largely dependent on the growth of the Magnificent Seven. “Yet we've seen gold has done spectacularly well this year. European equities have typically outperformed the US particularly if you take into account the dollar weakness that we've seen this year.” Growth in the US stock market is heavily concentrated on just a handful of companies nicknamed the Magnificent Seven - Google’s parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - which brings with it a lot of risk particularly if there is a falloff in the tech sector. Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, has seen its stock price surge over the course of the year as tech companies scramble to buy as many of its graphics processing units (GPUs) as possible to put into data centres to power their AI models. Nvidia alone accounts for over 7% of the S&P 500. Mr Charalambous said the Vanguard S&P 500 is a “speculative type of investing” and the risk might be higher than they realise. "People typically wouldn't realize the level of risk that they may be undertaking when they go into a fund like that,” he said. Data from the Central Bank of Ireland shows the market value of Irish resident holdings of securities stood at just under €6 trillion (tn) as of the end of September - an increase of €353m over the quarter. Of this total, Irish pension funds account for €51bn while household investments account for €28.26bn. Listed shares accounted for €2.4tn of the total with the US being the primary destination for Irish resident investment in stocks accounting for 58% of the total value or €1.4tn. In comparison, the Irish stock market only accounts for 2% or €49bn, of the total money Irish investment in stocks. The surge in share valuations in the US stock market is primarily being driven by the Magnificent Seven of which many are heavily investing in AI and its supporting infrastructure, particularly data centres. However, as of yet, there has been little return on this investment for these companies and if the so-called AI bubble bursts, this could spell trouble for Irish investors who have a lot of money wrapped up in US stocks. In terms of households holdings of listed shares, it reached an all-time high during the third quarter reaching €11.5bn. However, this is largely due to the increase in the overall total market value which increased by around €700m in the quarter. During the budget in October, former finance minister Paschal Donohoe announced a reduction in the investment exit tax from 41% to 38% from January 1 which makes it a little cheaper to actually invest in ETFs or other investment products. This rate could come down in the future potentially reaching the 33% rate set for capital gains tax. Due to these tax changes, Mr Carroll said coming into 2026 it’s now “more advantageous” to invest than it has been over the last number of years because of the exit tax coming down. “Hopefully that should come down even more,” he said, adding that even if it came down to 33% it would still be quite high compared to the US and the UK. Capital gains tax is paid at 33% on the profits of the sale or disposal of certain access such as shares in a company or bonds. However, an exit tax is paid on the profit from an investment in a fund - such as an ETF - and is charged at 38%. In addition, under deemed disposal rules, that tax is liable to be paid every eight years regardless of whether the asset is sold or not. Given the lower rate of tax on holding single shares, rather than investing in broad funds, Mr Carroll said these rules do not "promote good investing”. “You get 33% if you hold a single stock which is very risky, versus holding a tiny, tiny percentage of tens of thousands of stocks all around the world, you get taxed heavily on that,” he said. "The best practice is, if you have the money now and you don't need access to it, now is the best time to invest,” he said. "Like long term investing isn't essentially risky, it's more the risk of not having enough money in the future or when you need it. If you don't have enough money to pay for your children's education fund, or you don't have enough money to retire at 65 and you need to continue to work longer than you'd hoped, that's the kind of real risk,” Mr Carroll said.
