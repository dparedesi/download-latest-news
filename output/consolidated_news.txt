Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trump offers an optimistic vision of relations with countries in the Middle East. The Supreme Court’s upcoming hearing on birthright citizenship will tackle the power of lower courts. And the Menendez brothers were resentenced in their parents’ 1989 killings. Here’s what to know today. President Donald Trump spoke of a future for the Middle East steeped in prosperity, business deals and technological advances as he announced the U.S. would end sanctions against war-torn Syria and signed a $600 billion investment agreement with Saudi Arabia in his first visit to the region since his second term began. He also offered an image of rising regional powers steeped in homegrown economic self-development. Applause followed Trump’s promise to withdraw sanctions in Syria. But in announcing his “fervent wish” that Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords, the diplomatic agreements Trump’s first administration made between Israel and several Arab nations, the president drew silence from the room. The ongoing conflict with Hamas remains a sticking point for Saudi Arabia, which has reaffirmed its support for a Palestinian state in recent months. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S. includes $20 billion in AI data centers and other technologies, while companies like Google, Salesforce, Uber and Oracle will invest $80 billion in projects across both countries, according to a White House statement. Also in attendance at yesterday’s ceremonial events were Sam Altman of Open AI, Palantir CEO Alex Carp, billionaire Blackrock co-founder Larry Fink and the leaders of companies like Amazon and Coca-Cola, to pitch Saudi investors as the kingdom promises to spend on technology, infrastructure and more. Elon Musk was also present. Trump’s rhetoric and vision of a prosperous future with the region contrasted the words of former President Joe Biden, who deemed Saudi Arabia “a pariah” before taking office. And while rejecting the idea that U.S. policy should judge foreign leaders’ morals, he swiped at destructive forces in the region, calling out Iran for causing “unthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond.” Today, Trump met with Syria's new president in a major breakthrough for the former jihadi commander. Read the full story here. Also looming over Trump’s visit this week is Qatar’s proposed gift of a luxury plane to be used as a new Air Force One for the president. Trump has said he would accept it. However, aviation experts said converting the 747 jet would cost over $1 billion and might not be completed by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. The jet would have to be dismantled, part by part, to ensure there were no listening devices or other vulnerabilities, and then fitted with sophisticated systems for secure government communications. That’s not all. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments tomorrow over President Donald Trump’s plan to end birthright citizenship, but the court is not actually using the cases before it to give the final word on whether Trump can reinterpret the long-understood meaning of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. Instead, it will focus on the question of whether lower-court judges have the authority to block the policy nationwide. The Trump administration is asking the court to limit the scope of the birthright citizenship injunctions so that they apply only to individual people, organizations that sued or potentially the 22 states that challenged Trump’s executive order. In recent months, his administration and allies have raged at judges for issuing “universal injunctions” concerning birthright citizenship and other policies which a DOJ official characterized as a “direct attack” on presidential power. While broad injunctions have also been used against former Presidents Joe Biden (18 during his term) and Barack Obama (19 during his two terms), Trump, who saw 86 injunctions during his first term, has sought to use executive power to circumvent Congress more than his predecessors. Five of the six members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority have, in various cases, raised concerns about universal injunctions and suggested they should be curbed in certain circumstances. Read the full story here. R&B singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, took the stand on the second day of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ federal sex trafficking trial, detailing years of alleged abuse by the music mogul. Ventura is the prosecution’s star witness, and her 2023 lawsuit against Combs, which was settled privately one day after it was filed, became a framework for the government’s sprawling case against the music mogul. In her first day on the stand, Ventura, 38, gave graphic and emotional testimony of alleged physical abuse and control that included dayslong, drug-fueled sexual encounters with male escorts under Combs’ direction. She said she first participated in the “freak-offs” around 2008, when she was 22, and they continued while she dated Combs on and off before the pair split in 2018. The sex would occur in Combs’ homes, her homes and hotel suites around the world, and Ventura said they might find escorts off Craigslist, paying them between $1,500 and $6,000. Combs appeared to listen intently during the testimony. “I felt pretty horrible about myself,” Ventura said. “I felt disgusting. I felt humiliated.” Ventura, who first met Combs in 2005 when she was 19 and signed a 10-album deal with his Bad Boy label, also testified that her music career stalled when arranging “freak offs” for Combs “became a job.” She went on to say that angering Combs would result in physical and ongoing psychological abuse. Read more about Ventura’s testimony and her allegations against Combs. She’s expected to take the stand again today, and her testimony could last through the week.

After months of delays, opposition from Los Angeles County’s district attorney and a series of witnesses who advocated for them, Erik and Lyle Menendez are now eligible for parole in the 1989 killings of their parents at their Beverly Hills home. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said in a ruling yesterday that the brothers would be resentenced to 50 years to life, adding that he did not believe they posed an “unreasonable risk” if released. Now, a California parole board will weigh whether the men are suitable for release and is expected to submit its clemency recommendation next month to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The brothers, who have been serving life sentences without the possibility of parole, gave statements after yesterday’s ruling. Lyle said he made no excuses for killing his parents or for seeking to have people perjure themselves on his behalf. Erik echoed those comments. Read the full story here. I’ve always been fascinated with learning about Louisiana’s history and unique cultural stories. As someone who has done extensive family research myself in the state, it’s exciting to uncover unexpected connections. The process feels like a scavenger hunt. So when I started seeing chatter about Pope Leo XIV’s ties to New Orleans on social media, I connected with genealogist Alex DaPaul Lee, who has assisted me in previous archival searches for my reporting in Louisiana. He told me that he had discovered evidence of Leo’s ancestral roots, which show his Creole background through his great-great-grandmother, Celeste Lemelle. But historic documentation from Louisiana, as we saw while looking through the Lemelle family’s records, can reveal both the highs and lows of history: ownership, status, literacy, freedom and wealth, juxtaposed with racism, social class divides, slavery and discrimination. All of it adds spice and complexity to the perfect bowl of gumbo. The resulting story of Pope Leo’s lineage shines a light on our imperfect American history while bringing an extra layer of pride to people from Louisiana. — Maya Eaglin, NBC News correspondent Wondering how to treat scars and reduce their appearance?

Pull the military out and send those prisoners to a supermax prison in the US. Yes, they will then be entitled to full rights to defend themselves in American courts but we all have to make sacrifices. That leaves you with 45 square miles (117 km2) of land and water on the shore of Guantánamo Bay. So then you take a page out of Trump’s playbook and turn it into a luxurious resort for the rich and wealthy. You can have high-priced hotels, casinos, knocking shops, restaurants and shopping arcades. If you told Trump that a prime block of land would be set aside for a Trump hotel, he would totally buy into the whole project. Workers you ask? Put in contracts for Cuban workers and buy produce from them to keep the Cubans onside and not to stir up trouble. It’s either that or follow that tech bro plan which would be nothing more that a money pit – with them the major beneficiaries. Much better than the status quo, so why not give it a try?

A scam for all seasons. https://t.co/hgHr4TlauL I completely disagree with all commentators currently claiming a “break” in US/Israeli relations or speaking about a mood shift or Trump breaking with Netenyahu. You are only confused here if you accept such claims as valid. Trump is not lifting all Syrian sanctions for nothing, and we are certainly not speaking about mineral rights or any other such nonsense here. The genocide is still on, Netenyahu is still open about it, and I would bet my last cent that the concessions extracted from this deal are that Syria will take in Gazan refugees. I think this is primary purpose of Trump’s entire trip, to carry on the very same Israeli and State Department policy that was formulated in October/November of 2023. Every manner of PR and bullshit media flak has been thrown up around this but the plan has carried on regardless for 19 months now. I see no reason to think Trump’s tour is not simply a repeat of Bliken’s efforts in 2023 and 2024 to find somewhere to dump the still living Gazans. Whether the rest of the Arab states have agreed to the displacement, I don’t know. But I for one am certain that the cutout Jolani has agreed to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Gaza(His trip to meet Macron has convinced me). I am surprised so many commentators have forgotten about this entire angle. Pipeline gas from Qatar to Europe, via Saudi, Jordan and Syria? Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The article flies over a few facts, making it seem that its the current government that has abandoned nuclear power – in reality, that decision was made 20 years or more when a number of plants under construction were mothballed – partially because they didn’t make much economic sense at the time, and partially under intense US pressure over its nuclear weapons program. The one remaining nuclear power plant, at Maanshan (a very nice surf spot as it happens) is more than 40 years old and would cost a fortune to keep running. Its contribution to overall Taiwanese energy use is pretty small. You can certainly argue that it was a serious mistake by Taiwan to opt for coal and gas instead of nuclear for its electricity, but that decision was made decades ago and would take further decades (and many billions of dollars) to reverse. Extending the operating licence for Maanshan would make very little difference. A much better bet for Taiwan would be investing in geothermal energy – the entire country is a major geothermal hotspot. What about a cable connection to the mainland? LOL A quick google search on Taiwan using geothermal came up with this “the island is very densely populated, and operational space is limited in many areas. In contrast, the less densely populated areas are very mountainous, which does not make a strong case for installing a rig either.” It goes on to be much more positive. United Airlines flight attendants stage a protest at the PR event launching a new business class seat. No contract in 5 years, lowest pay of major US airlines. Interesting to note that the 3 gulf carriers pay more than the US. @xJonNYC The FAs have their say at today’s UA new Polaris event They got arrested for trespassing. Hope they aren’t sent to El Salvador. >>>Boosting ICE budgets is bipartisan Polygraph I know that this view will be unpopular with the vast majority of the peeps… If you don’t like a law (eg, migration), repeal it. Selective enforcement is corrosive to society/govt legitimacy long-term. This term, your side doesn’t enforce migration laws. Next term, the other side stops enforcing environmental laws. “Ask for forgiveness (or look the other way), don’t ask for permission” (at all levels of society) is one of the 100 things destroying America’s social fabric. Be that as it may, the article in question is about the ICE BUDGET and the fact that it’s steady increases have been supported by both parties, regardless of who’s in power. So on THIS issue, the precise point is that “your side” and “their side” are the same, and that the alternation between parties makes no difference. I find the “Mission Creep” of ICE disturbing since all of us whose ancestors were not born here more than say, 500 years ago, are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. With some not especially creative “lawyering” this extends the jurisdiction of ICE, shall we say, rather broadly. Would that be a feature or a bug? Also note, the border czar … I believe that is his moniker … Homan was quoted, when challenged about some of his actions, “I was only following orders.” That defense was definitively shot down during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. I actually remember that, young though I was. Now you can question the Nuremberg trials and opn some grounds, I do. You can wonder why the borders have been wide open until you look at who hires and benefits from all that inexpensive labor. You can, as I did at the time, see the Patriot Act as among the worst of bad laws, and I do. Why you might ask? Did 17 or 27 …however many “intelligence” agencies there are … need another layer of bureaucracy troweled on top of them? I think not. Was the creation of national police forces … think ICE and others … never stop with just one … necessary? Depends on what plans, hopes, dreams, schemes, you have for them. As to your general points, could not agree more. What once was a government has become a shambles. Shambles: among whose definitions are disorder, ruin, clutter jumble and mess and finally a place of bloodshed or carnage. The OED would note it once referred to a slaughterhouse. (Apologies for the pedantic aside) The absence of long term planning or of follow through in the face of partisan one-up-man-ship, dueling lobbyists, and showers of “campaign contributions” in pursuit of access has reduced the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber to sound and silliness in pursuit of perpetuity in office by the unambitious and perpetuity in office and a small to medium fortune for the more bright eyed. But my cynicism overflows or is it realism? The result is visible this day as The Don as styled by Gay Talese in The Godfather, cavorts about the Arab states being showered with cash in one form or another ostensibly for public purposes, while his offspring and other relations hustle for the various family businesses. In the world of William Gibson’s The Peripheral this is called a Klept … you can look it up. Realism? Cynicism? Folly? Fantasy? Take you choice, but keep an eye on ICE. It’s not that your view is unpopular exactly it’s that it derives from what I believe is nostalgic unreality. Selective enforcement is the very nature of law in this country, has long been, and will ever be. The facade of rule of law has in my view largely been sundered not by the actual cavalier character of government (again, it was ever thus, sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception) but rather by the incredible diversity of media coverage possible in the 21st century which allows the sufficiently politically conscious to view every conceivable angle of policy and identify hypocrisies and inconsistencies at a level of granularity previously reserved for dedicated scholars. Indeed even the comparatively politically narcoleptic now live in such demographically stratified infospaces that it’s perfectly impossible not to perceive the comparative lawlessness of their political opposite. We once – before my lifetime so I take this as an article of faith – had a monoculture in news media that was capable of weaving a coherent throughline between any number of acts of brazen extralegal fiat such that the American public could digest it all. That is certainly not the case now and I cannot conceive of it ever being so again. Indeed, selective law enforcement is a common feature of all unfree societies where a few people rule over everyone else and forbid people from upholding their own laws. In free societies, everyone is expected to agree on and uphold their own laws and thus there are not exceptions like this. What Ironic is saying is true – it’s better to have societies where everyone agrees on rules that work for everybody. Otherwise people just argue over whose rules and enforcement preferences dominate. And of course the rich usually get their way. great, timely piece by historian Zachary Foster: https://palestinenexus.com/articles/jewish-antizionism It is a good overview, although slanted towards the English-speaking Jewish world in its last section: there is almost nothing about the current attitude of European (or South American) Jews towards zionism. I also found two intriguing articles by the same author on that site: How Zionists Prevented Jewish Refugees From Returning Home After WWII and Was Zionism about Rescuing Jews Fleeing Persecution? No. A further article confirms my earlier impression that the staunch support of Israel by the likes of Sunak, Meloni, Macron, Biden, Scholz, etc, is not due to any strategic advantage (economic, military, geographic, or otherwise), but because Israel is the country where Western countries, where antisemitism is latent, especially in right-wing circles, can dump their Jewish population. And if this happens to the detriment of Arabs, so what? “US Hypocrisy on Terrorism Reaches New Heights, While Trump Signals a Welcomed Shift in US Foreign Policy” I thought that Larry Johnson would be more stirred up about Trump with meeting Syria’s Jolani. That guy is basically an al-Qaeda leader and until recently had a $10 million bounty on his head by the US government. So I can see it now. Trump enters the room to meet Jolani who comes in with a trimmed beard, polished shoes, an expensive Rolex and a bespoke suit. The cameras are rolling for this historic event. Trump thinks to himself at least this is one leader that does not go around wearing t-shirts. As Jolani gets closer, he rips his jacket open to reveal sticks of dynamite, shouts ‘Allahu Akbar’ before hugging Trump, then BOOM! Can you imagine? US’ side of the Shi’a-Sunni schism! Sunni terrorists, sustained by USA since 1980’s are the good guys. Trump in KSA is renewing US pledge to Arabian peninsula Wahabbi. As long as Sunnis in charge Israel is safe. Sell them new anti missile shield, golden dome for Medina! It’s really not the Sunnis at large but specifically Wahhabi Takfiri fighters funded by the Gulf despots and supported by US/Israeli deep state. They’ve been at it since 1970s Afghanistan, kicked it up a notch in the Balkans and then Chechyna, then Uyghurs, Iraq, Lybia, Syria, etc. Associating these predominantly Muslim murdering freaks with the bulk of Muslims is like associating Christian Zionists in Congress with all Christians. I think that Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia is perhaps the best I’ve seen give him. To be honest I can’t recall a better speech from a US president. Among items strengths, he’s gracious to the hosts, rather than lecturing them as other Western leaders like Biden or Baerbock would do. He’s acknowledging real strengths in the hosts, which is they built up gleaming cities, that they’re probably proud of themselves. He’s acknowledging real failures at home, the trillions wasted on Baghdad on Kabul and nation building there. Those cities would be better off without US nation building. And finally it reflects real recent policy changes. They’re lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria and they ended the idiotic attacks on Yemen. Honestly, I think a large percentage of the influence is how well they dress. And they let him touch the orb. He really enjoyed that! Agreed on the speech, but let’s see where he goes with it. On Syria, give a leg up to US’ “refined” terrorists. If IDF can kill Gazans new Syrian allies can kill non SUnni. Keeping in mind that Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize (2009) for making speeches and without making positive actions toward peace, I would say that Trump was following in Obama’s footsteps, considering one of Trump’s goals is receiving a Nobel. I’m afraid that starting a trade war with China, bombing civilians in Yemen, threatening Iran with a full-fledged attack, helping Israel commit a genocide in Gaza and keeping the war in the Ukraine going is not going to get him that Nobel peace prize. Not even if he regifts the Qatari jet to the Nobel committee? As proven by how they gave a Nobel to Obama before he even did anything, they are a cheap date. If I recall correctly, he did bomb the Moon. Perhaps we should encourage Trump to take still more bribes from the Arab countries if it means a correction of the long standing and senseless policy of favoring the 9 1/2 million Jewish Israelis over the triple digit millions who surround them. After all there has long been plenty of campaign bribery going on to further the anti Arab cause. In his recent talk with Judge Nap Alastair Crooke points out that the Cold War excuse for our ME policy was to keep the Soviets out of the Middle East. But the Cold War–mostly also senseless–is over despite neocons trying to revive it. FDR favored the Arabs while still asking them to accept Zionism. Truman on the other hand defied the advice of his State Department by siding with Israel. This policy mistake engendered all that has followed. At this point Israel isn’t going anywhere but for their own good someone needs to introduce them to reality. > he’s gracious to the hosts Because he wants $40 oil. Trump is a salesman. > lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria Abu Mohammed al-Jolani was a most wanted terrorist a few month ago. Now that he is in charge, so no more sanctions. Trump is no different, he is just doing “it” differently. The Don was being polite for a change, but he respects wealth and glitter, besides it costs nothing. In this case one can quote the nameless person who said of a political speech, “He talks purty, don’t he.” Obama rode “talkin’ purty” to the presidency then betrayed all, almost all(?) of his promises right out the gate. The Don wants a Nobel Peace prize because Obama received one and, i am convinced,The Don has never forgiven Obama for mocking him at the Press Club(?) dinner in DC in 2011. Vengeful persons neither forget nor forgive. Take this however you will. Churchill is quoted as saying, “When you are going to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite.” It is irritating to praise Trump for something like this but you’re not wrong if just regarding the content of the speech itself. Actually, more than irritating, it’s mortifying that this level of graciousness – what I would describe as completely reasonable and expected etiquette when one is a guest – is something laudable in the Western context. We’re grading on a frankly embarrassing curve. Trump’s speech suggested to me that the last person he spoke with before getting off the plane was Tulsi Gabbard. If so, good for both of them. I found this to be an interesting thread dissecting what Trump was banging on about … between Arnaud Bertrand and below commenter. Amine Idriss @amibiaka · 19h Arnaud, I see what you’re pointing to — but let’s not kid ourselves. Trump’s speech isn’t a breakthrough in appreciating civilizational diversity. It’s a classic expression of his white nationalist worldview, dressed up as respect for sovereignty. https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1922443275526668625 Arnaud’s core argument is – “Regarding Trump’s speech in Saudi, some see it as a refreshing break from liberal hypocrisy. I see it as something more dangerous, the normalization of a neo-mercantilist worldview. And that’s not a nostalgic return to realism; it’s a revival of the very ideology that once justified conquest, colonization, and the commodification of entire peoples. People in the West today complain about migration, as if it’s an invasion. But most of those who migrate to the West are fleeing the long-term consequences of Western imperialism, of resource extraction, of wars fought for oil or influence, of economic systems designed to benefit a few and impoverish the many. This doesn’t mean illegal immigration should be glorified. But let’s be honest: I have no sympathy for anti-immigrant rhetoric when it comes from the descendants of those who directly benefited from colonial plunder and racial capitalism.” – snip It seems to me that multipolarity is not unlike a global shit in the magnetic field, fluxes, and then bang it changes. How networks of power position themselves for it, with a side of climate change, is a sight to behold, as such I highly discount anything coming from Anglophone camp[see above] and especially anything coming from disingenuous Trump/camp[self serving]. “PM Modi Elaborates on S-400 Missile System’s Importance For India’s Air Defence: Why They Matter Now More Than Ever” How long until the US orders India to get rid of those S-400s because it is against US law for them to own them. And then to tell India to buy inferior Patriot batteries instead – which don’t exist at the moment – and to buy hundreds if not thousands of Patriot battery missiles – which have not even been manufactured yet. If India is lucky, they should get those Patriot batteries & missiles by 2040. You think that Pakistan will wait? The US doesn’t have that level of control over India. Might change in the future, but India is an important part of trying to contain China and because it has a conflict with China it also has more incentives to maintain relations with Russia. The Turks are much more vulnerable to pressure and have less reasons to keep Russia on side. India already has a domestic Patriot equivalent (medium range, up to around 150km), the Barak 8, which is jointly produced with Israel. Earlier reports indicated that India bought the S-400 specifically for the purposes of providing air defence over its borders with China – hence range and anti-stealth capability is particularly important. The recent possible failures in conflict with Pakistan may result in a rethink about where they are deployed. Mixing two separate systems is not considered good practice in air defence, so its a curious decision – presumably they have fallen behind in producing a Barak with the range to match the S-400. The big question, presumably well pondered by the Russians and Israelis, is how they stop each side getting access to key operational and technical inside information. If the systems can talk to each other – even if it be trough a third system – then it’s fine and dandy. Something akin to not having all your eggs in the same basket. But if the systems are isolated enough to basically fight alone, then they’re out-dated and handicapped even before they go operational. Allegedly Iran can take pretty much any air-defense system and make it work with their command, control, communication & situational awareness (C3/SA) network for air defense. “Illinois governor is first in US to block federal access to personal data on autism” Hey, Pritzker, why not block federal access to all personal data? Fourth amendment, anyone? Or does it apply only to corporate persons now? It’s funny how someone(s) is positioning/astroturfing Pritzker (billionaire, Dem. Machine scion) as a potential “Resistance” leader-2028 contender, see Jimmy Kimmel visit and Pritzker’s name popping up in random WaPo-NYt mentions. With friends like elite Democrats, who needs Republicans?! Pritzker, Slotkin and Buttigieg! Who says Ds don’t have a bench? (With JB, it had better be a sturdy one unless his consultants put him on Ozempic) Well, if the DemParty were to have a genuine democratic free Republican-quality primary for the first time in many years, we could see what shakes out. Or even get a vote on what shakes out. If . . . . No more down that path for me. I’m a veteran of McGovern in a small way, and recall how the Democrat Party not just abandoned a candidate, but actively allied against him. “Geonomics, nationalism and trade” This is why I decry the entire project to manufacture a divorce in the original term “political economy” into supposed “sciences” of each, an achievement of the unholy alliance of the marginalist school (Alfred Marshall being the foremost cementer of the ideas of Jevons, Menger and Walras) in economics and their Gilded Age funders in banking. It’s harmless enough in microeconomics, but intellectually lethal in macroeconomics — because in the latter “the politics never really went away.” It’s also why wherever international business investment went, gunboats inevitably followed … 🤨 “Qatar’s $400M jet for Trump is a gold-plated security nightmare” It doesn’t have to be. Trump could lease that 747 Jumbo jet back from the US government for a dollar a month while the government picks up the tab for the running expenses. He then announces that all those that own one of his Trump meme coins can go into a lottery to get a flight aboard this Jumbo jet for an hour or two. People would go out and buy & register one like they would with lottery tickets, especially MAGA supporters. Those that win would pay a $50 fee but that would be seen as cheap for a Trump flight and there would be no security issues at all. And is this so different to when recently top buyers of his coin could get a dinner with him? https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/top-buyers-trump-cryptocurrency-dinner It’s kind of amusing how even given Trump’s famously lax definition of ‘national security threats’ (the opioid crisis, illegal immigration, countries running a trade surplus with the US, the continued existence of Canada/Greenland as independent nations…) a Presidential plane supplied by a foreign power somehow doesn’t make the list. If you get behind on your payments on your Tesla, they can auto- drive your car back to the dealership. Makes me speculate that if Tesla can do that – then they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with Musk politics…..just speculating ya know – maybe a fun little sci-fi – a little data integration with siri, doorbells and all sorts of smart devices combined along with digital currency and Homeland security and police fusion centers…… why you could deport anybody you want with a self driving cab or car instead of iconviniencing ICE and the courts….you could knock off any opposition and disapear people at will….erase their identity and digital footprint or frame someone easy-peasy………..who needs to mess with that constitution or laws etc. Sounds about rite for the duopoly’s vision for Making America Great Again and Defending democracy…… I just wish they would tell me for whom they are defending democracy for and, for whom are they making America great Brings to mind the death of Michael Hastings, the journalist who got General Stanley McChrystal fired. During the morning’s brief channel surfing, I came across Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick lamenting the decline of ethics over the past couple of decades. For answers, they turned with all seriousness to their guest, Stanley McChrystal. Don’t change before the Empire falls. You’ll laugh so hard, you’ll crack the walls. Sometimes, I just miss the days when satire was a thing and not reality. Yes, I’ve kind of come to the conclusion that it woulnt matter whether Trump or some other clown was in the White House, we really are screwed. Trump just showed us the true nature of things. These tech billionaires own us and there is really nothing that can be done about it. Any of these jack asses, could set anyone up for a fall. And frankly with very little effort or evidence. And just who is gonna do anything About it? Anyone that thinks the courts or the press or the political class will help is deluded. Trump will have his plane, the USPS will be privatized, Social Security and medicare too. It’s all gone, along with our so called democracy. It done. That picture from Saudi Arabia was our future. Along with the list of billionaires. They own it and there nothing we can do about it. The democracy they are defending is the facade for what making America great again means. Simply great and democratic for them, not us. RE: “…they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with [insert elite name here] politics…” Very true! And you might enjoy the Terra Ignota scifi series where self-flying cars are a major plot point. Excerpt from the wiki entry – “The Six-Hive Transport System is a global network of flying cars, the primary mode of transportation in the series. They are fast enough to circle the globe in less than 4.2 hours, made possible by Cartesian set-sets. Mukta was the prototype car made in 2073 and now resides in the Saneer-Weeksbooth home. Utopia [a political faction] operates its own car system, separate to the primary one used in the series. The Utopian system is slightly slower than the primary one, but has 100% fewer accidents.” You will have to read the series (or at least the first two books which are great – the latter two are subpar) to find out why one political faction refuses to use the global transportation system. Suffice it to say that after reading the series, I will never be getting into any driverless car. Cars themselves will drive to the police station on detecting a non-white person in the driver’s seat? Regarding Guantanamo being re-purposed as a prison for migrants: Obama, when refusing to pursue criminal investigations against torture and other criminal acts at Guantanamo and elsewhere, said it was time to “look forward, not backward.” We now have a much clearer idea of what he meant. “RFK Jr. is full of crap” Somehow, looking at the images of RFK jr. taking his grandkids to go swim in those polluted waters, I am reminded of that 1975 film “Jaws.” The scene where people were on the beach but were not going into the water because of the recent shark attack. That is, until the local official leans on some older people to go into the water and when they do, they take their very young grandchildren with them into those waters. Don’t know why I thought of that old film… “Trump envoys Witkoff and Kellogg to go to Turkey for Russia-Ukraine talks, sources say” Those talks are going to go nowhere. Zelensky is trying to turn it into a media stunt by daring Putin to go there but what would they talk about? Zelenski’s 10-point peace plan? Kellogg, whose plan Trump has adopted, hopes Putin turns up. Even I know that negotiations don’t work that way and it is only after everything is settled that you call in the leaders to sign the agreements. Trump made himself sound like an idiot by indicting that he might just drop in to any meeting. Everybody knows that Presidents on Air Force One just drop in on random visits to countries from time to time to do a bit of shopping and maybe to pick up a pizza. The only reason why they want Putin there is to give him an ultimatum to freeze the conflict or else. Maybe even do to him what Trump and Vance did to Zelenski in that White House meeting several weeks ago. And Kellogg and others have said that as soon as there is a freeze, that they will flood the Ukraine with troops from at least four NATO nations. Looks like this war is going to be decided on the battlefield as Trump only wants negotiations so that Russia wins the war but loses the peace. And as it is now no longer Biden’s war but Trump’s war, the failure is all going to be on him. And all those neocons like Lindsay Graham will pretend that they were not pushing him but will blame Trump for not trying hard enough and which the media will go along with. I do not recall Witkoff or Kellogg being invited. Why send two persons with opposing views in the first place? Lavrov should, politely, tell them to bugger off. Trump should pull a page from Teddy Roosevelt. Invite Russia and Kiev to come to Portsmouth, NH. June is very nice in New England and the hotel from 1905 has been updated. The space at the shipyard may need polish. Bretton Woods is nice, too. “How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump” Let us treat this as the New Yorker’s bid for the Most Embarrassing Blame Deflection Award for 2025 (wittier name pending). At the moment the only other candidate is that ludicrous New York Times article which apparently informed us that Russia would’ve been roundly defeated in the special military operation but for the intransigence, incompetence, and possibly incontinence of the Ukrainian military brass; the academy is therefore actively seeking other submissions, as unsealing an envelope for a 50/50 chance isn’t nearly enough fun. When are we going to get the Pulitzer Award for Gaslighting? Or is that the standard Pulitzer nowadays? Oh I hate Donald Trump—-but hold my beer as I do everything in my power to get him re-elected! btw have your beer prices gone up? In my lovely native Bavaria hops harvest has serious shortages due to lack of water. Gooooooood Mooooooooorning Fiatnam! In the fetid QWERTY jungle online where the numismatrix plied its traits, it was all about the skill-ratio, if you could turn a lone greenback into 30 bucks vis a vis crypto, it was a lot better than being stuck with the pyramid scheme on the back of a FRN, and why doesn’t that eagle on the right have a phalanx of old glories behind it, with an artificial breeze fanning them? Regarding the Notes on the Crisis article on “Can China “Buy” America?”: in the 1980s I was tracking mergers and acquisitions as part of a group investigating how dirty money, after being laundered and brought back into the US, was buying up control of established companies. Back then, the major “public” worry was over the Japanese and what they would do with their rapidly growing trade surpluses. But the numbers on dollar amounts of mergers and acquisitions showed a much different reality. By far the largest amount in m&a was by “investors” from Britian and the British empire members of Australia and Canada. The Brits were usually at least three times larger than the Japanese. I was not surprised when legal probes a few years later identified HSBC (then known by its original imperial moniker the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) as one of the largest launderers of dirty money. HSBC — the infamous Hong Shang — of course, was originally established to process the revenue of the British opium trade out of China. “Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,” The UK was a major legitimate investor abroad in the 80’s and the pool of safe countries for FDI.was much smaller. I don’t think the figures were directionally affected by corruption (but BCCI might have been part of it…). In HSBC’s defence, though, their crime was to purchase the extremely dodgy Republic Bank from Edmund Safra, which had a major NYC oresence and apparently zero KYC and AML controls! The US regulator fined them (HSBC) USD 12bn in exchange for a non-admission of guilt plea but in reality they inherited the crimes! Republic under Safra was suspected of tax evasion but also of other illegitimacies, in part because nobody could understand how low margin lending to governments and to physical goods trade could generate the profits claimed, especially when Republic employed very little leverage. The implication is that it was earning a vig on whatever its clients were doing. Given that Safra: – started out in physical shipments of cast. – was a Syrian-Lebanese New – lent to a lot of governments Safra died in a mysterious fire at his Monaco penthouse that was later judged arson…. PS: It is not surprising that fingers were pointed at Iran-contra type deals and drug money, a but like Alan Stanford. Here is an article very lamely pretending these was nothing crooked in public but leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. but it is not hard to read between the lines. https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-biography-probes-into-mysterious-backstory-of-billionaire-banker-edmond-j-safra/ Hunter Biden must be green with envy, the Biden’s only managed to Grift about $23MM total while the Donald’s Family has cleared well over $100MM from crypto alone and if you add the $400MM jet they are averaging better than $125MM a Month. In other happy news regular Gas is at $5.29 per Gallon, cash price at the local 76 station. That’s quite something to be able to gamble on the temperature of a city on a given day, why bother with mundane casinos? Gambling was fairly forbidden a century ago, and now nothing related to gambling is forbidden… heck, a couple of ballplayers who blackened the diamond by one throwing the world series for a gambler, and the other who gambled on games, were reinstated in the MLB yesterday, never mind. Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The Japanese prefecture of Fukushima is about 5,000 square miles in area, and remains mostly an abandoned area a decade after the reactor meltdown in the prefecture. I assume this will not change for another couple of hundred thousand years. The island of Taiwan is about 13,000 square miles in area, or perhaps two and a half times the size of the Fukushima prefecture. A single reactor catastrophe there on the scale of Fukushima will therefore, to a first approximation, make a half to a third of the island uninhabitable. It’s very easy to see why Taiwan is getting rid of nuclear power as fast as they can, though it doesn’t seem to be as fast as one would like. The mystery is why Japan isn’t doing the same thing. On the other hand, if Taiwan were converted into a nuclear wasteland, China and the US could stop fighting about its future and everyone could relax. I guess there really is a silver lining to every cloud. Fukushima Prefecture was wholly inappropriately abandoned. More people died from moving, upheaval and, in those who stayed, abandonment than could ever die of anthropogenic radiation exposure, especially in an elderly farming population. Sorry if this is a dumb question, was that incident really as dramatic as it was pictured in our (European) media or was it exaggerated or possibly even underplayed. For those curious, I took my avatar name here from the mascot of the Fukushima nuclear plant. For some strange reason they eliminated all reference to him from the internet around about 2011. It’s very hard to get a real grip on the true extent of damage, not least because the Japanese are very good at message control (aided by their ability to keep foreign experts at bay). The extreme radiation was very localised, and thankfully not much went airborne, unlike with Chernobyl. So Revenant is correct to say that the overall direct threat to anyone further than a few miles from the plant was pretty low – but certainly not negligible. But it is still a gigantic ticking bomb which will take many years of control to prevent any kind of chain reaction that could restart a reactor fire, or a major release of radioactivity to the sea (bioconcentration in seafood is ultimately a much bigger human health threat than airborne release). This is one (not the only) reason Taiwan then mothballed its new nuke plants. Taiwan is even more seismically active than Japan and prone to very extreme natural disasters. The scale of the Typhoons that regularly hit the island have to be seen to be believed. It complicates everything. Trump takes a blow torch to the neocons and interventionists while speaking to the Saudis. I am no great admirer of Trump, but I challenge you to find a previous American president who would have said anything remotely similar to what Trump was saying here. Sounds like Noam Chomsky could have written this. Unfortunately, the overall effect was kind of ruined by the fact that on the same trip, he was selling US weaponry out the wazoo. But still… Franklin Delano Roosevelt?! The good neighbour idea? Are the Turks copying Israel with their effort to split PKK? Is Ocalan becoming an Arafat in old age? Are we oing to have a Hamas-PKK and a Fatah/PA-PKK? Six cheetah cubs! I can only think at how many will survive! Heroine mother that one, all by herself… Heroic Mother of the Cheetah Soviet Union, First Class! Although they all look so peeved in that photo, I wonder if they had substantial investments in Tesla or something . . . re: llamas I was mistyping an internet address and ended up with writing “cria” into google. As it turns out that is actually a scientific term derived from the Spanish word for “baby” also describing young specimen of llamas. See Wiki: Etymology The term comes from the Spanish word cría, meaning “baby”. Its false cognate in English, crya (pronounced /ˈkraɪə/), was coined by British sailors who explored Chile in the 18th century and were quick to describe the camelids onomatopoeically according to the mwa sound they made, which was not unlike that of a human crying baby. On the X post “we’ve really decided to let people gamble on the specific temperature…” How do you determine a specific temperature of any town? This seems like a big “So what?” to me. If you check ambientweather.net you’ll see most towns have a pretty wide variance in temps. For example, in the town I live in today right now at 1:00PM, the temperature varies by at least 6F from one side to the other re: US elites instrumentalizing anti-racism JACOBIN The Trouble With Equity By Jennifer C.

Title: Merz woos Trump with invitation to German ancestral village

Time Published: 2025-05-14T10:47:26Z
Full Content:
The chancellor appears to want to appeal to the American president’s German ancestry in order to improve frayed relations. BERLIN — Germany’s new chancellor has a plan for getting on U.S. President Donald Trump’s good side: appeal to his German ancestry. Friedrich Merz said he has invited Trump to the western German village where the president’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born and raised before emigrating to the United States at the age of 16 in 1885 “I’ve invited him to Germany, to visit his ancestral town,” Merz said at a business summit in Berlin. “I’ll go there with him.” It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take up Merz on the offer. Despite Trump’s frequent criticisms of Germany, a country he had repeatedly called “delinquent” on defense spending, the president has often highlighted his German roots. “I have German in my blood,” he said during a 2019 meeting with Angela Merkel as the then-chancellor reacted with a look of amusement at that phrasing. The invitation comes as Merz prepares for his first official trip to Washington as chancellor. Although it is unclear when the visit will take place, Merz has said it will happen “soon.” A former chairman of BlackRock Germany and longtime supporter of the transatlantic alliance, Merz has often said he would appeal to Trump’s love of making “deals” in order to strengthen frayed relations between the U.S. and Germany over an array of issues, from Ukraine to tariffs. Merz and Trump have spoken twice since the German election. Their most recent call took place during Merz’s recent visit to Kyiv along with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. It’s not clear whether Trump would be well received in Kallstadt, his grandfather’s birthplace. In 2016, ahead of his first term in office, many in the town told POLITICO they didn’t care for the then-presidential candidate. “We really don’t give a damn about Trump,” one resident said at the time. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.” Restoring conscription would mark a major policy shift. Officials say the group planned explosive parcel attacks to spread fear and destabilize the country. The group, which opposes Germany’s constitutional order, is headed by a self-appointed monarch calling himself “King Peter.” The former Bundestag president is poised to become co-leader of the SPD as it attempts a reboot after historic election losses.

Title: Think Twice About Netflix Stock

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. FORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY - MAY 13: Phil Murphy speaks onstage during the Fort Monmouth ... More Groundbreaking Ceremony on May 13, 2025 in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. (Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Netflix) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares have been exceptionally successful this year, climbing approximately 25% since the beginning of January and trading close to $1,100 each. This increase can be attributed to several factors. Netflix’s financial results have been robust, driven by subscriber growth from lower-priced ad-supported plans, enforcement against password sharing, and rising advertising revenues. In Q1 2025, Netflix’s revenues surpassed projections, growing 13% to reach $10.54 billion, while earnings increased by 25% to $6.61 per share. The company has also successfully raised prices without encountering significant pushback from clients. In late January, the cost of its standard plan rose to around $18 monthly, while the premium plan increased to about $25 per month. Thus, does Netflix stock still offer good value? We believe that the stock appears appealing yet volatile, making it a challenging choice to purchase at its current price of approximately $1110. We think there are several reasons for concern regarding NFLX stock, which renders it attractive yet highly susceptible to negative events, given that its current valuation is very high. We reach our conclusion by assessing the current valuation of NFLX stock in relation to its operational performance over the past few years, along with its present and historical financial status. Our evaluation of Netflix based on key metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company demonstrates a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as explained below. Nonetheless, if you seek growth with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio provides an alternative – having outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered returns surpassing 91% since its launch. Considering what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, NFLX stock appears very pricey when contrasted with the overall market. • Netflix has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.3 compared to 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio is 65.3, in contrast to 17.6 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, it maintains a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55.2 compared to the benchmark's 24.5 Netflix’s Revenues have significantly increased over the past few years. • Netflix has experienced its top line increase at an average rate of 9.6% over the last 3 years (versus a 6.2% increase for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 15.6% from $35 billion to $40 billion in the last 12 months (compared to a growth of 5.3% for S&P 500) • In addition, its quarterly revenues grew 16.0% to $11 billion in the most recent quarter from $9.4 billion a year earlier (versus a 4.9% improvement for S&P 500) Netflix’s profit margins are greater than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Netflix’s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $10 billion, representing a high Operating Margin of 26.7% (compared to 13.1% for S&P 500) • Netflix’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) during this timeframe was $7.4 billion, signifying a moderate OCF Margin of 18.9% (compared to 15.7% for S&P 500) • Over the last four-quarter interval, Netflix’s Net Income was $8.7 billion – indicating a high Net Income Margin of 22.3% (compared to 11.3% for S&P 500) Netflix’s balance sheet appears very robust. • Netflix’s Debt was $16 billion at the conclusion of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization stands at $474 billion (as of 5/12/2025). This suggests a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 3.2% (compared to 21.5% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferred] • Cash (inclusive of cash equivalents) constitutes $8.4 billion of the $52 billion in Total Assets for Netflix. This results in a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 17.9% (compared to 15.0% for S&P 500) NFLX stock has experienced a slightly better impact than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash? features a comprehensive analysis of how the stock has performed during and after past market crashes. • NFLX stock dropped 75.9% from a peak of $691.69 on 17 November 2021 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 August 2024 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $1,156 on 4 May 2025 and currently trades at approximately $1110 • NFLX stock declined 22.9% from a peak of $387.78 on 18 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, versus a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock decreased 55.9% from a peak of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 In conclusion, Netflix’s performance based on the metrics highlighted above is as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Strong • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Neutral • Overall: Very Strong Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock stands out as appealing yet volatile, reaffirming our conclusion that NFLX is a difficult stock to purchase. Concerned about the unpredictable nature of NFLX stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably surpassing the S&P 500 over the past 4-year interval. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index, resulting in a smoother investment experience as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Ever since Donald J. Trump was re-elected president, we’ve witnessed a disheartening spectacle: big tech companies bending their knees to him, hoping to get him to kill antitrust actions against them and defend them from European Union rules and fines. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook have all in one way or another shown or declared support for the president’s agenda, especially his opposition to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs. Notably, all four attended his Jan. 20 inauguration and were front and center during the proceedings. Zuckerberg killed DEI efforts at Meta, abandoned attempts to contain misinformation on his services, makes regular pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, and called then-candidate Trump a “badass” after last year’s assassination attempt. He sounded like nothing so much as Trump himself (while using words of more than one syllable) when he told Joe Rogan on a podcast: “The corporate world is pretty culturally neutered. A culture that celebrates aggression a bit more has its own merits. Masculine energy, I think, is good.” Bezos killed DEI at Amazon. As the owner of The Washington Post he also squashed the newspaper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, killed a cartoon of tech leaders and Mickey Mouse bowing down to Trump, and ruled that the paper’s editorial and opinion pages will become right-wing, covering only “personal liberty and free markets,” with no opposing viewpoints allowed. Pichai killed off DEI efforts at Google and makes regular visits to see Trump in Florida. Cook is a bit of an outlier — although he attended the inauguration, he didn’t kill DEI at Apple and has made noises about working with Trump on tariff issues. The four companies haven’t gotten anything (yet) for their efforts; legal action against them begun under Trump’s predecessor are proceeding. Google faces being broken up after a judge ruled it illegally monopolized the advertising tech market. Meta is being prosecuted for illegally monopolizing the social media market by buying Instagram and What’s App and could be broken up as well. Amazon has been charged by the FTC with protecting its online retail monopoly by imposing fees on third-party sellers and favoring its own services over theirs. Apple has been sued by the Department of Justice for a variety of antitrust actions in protecting and extending its monopoly in the smartphone market. And while Trump has made statements about EU regulators — the White House last month criticized recent fines against Meta and Apple as a “novel form of economic extortion” — but has done little to get the EU to halt its actions against the companies. Meanwhile, Microsoft not only won’t valorize Trump, it’s also pushing back against him. The company has publicly supported its DEI efforts rather than killing them. In December, the company’s Chief Diversity Officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyr, wrote on LinkedIn that Microsoft’s DEI efforts are vital to the company’s success: “The business case for D&I [diversity and inclusion] is not only a constant, but is stronger than ever, reinforcing our belief that a diverse and inclusive workforce is crucial for innovation and success.” When worries surfaced that Trump might require American tech companies to suspend their cloud operations in Europe, or turn Europeans’ data over to the federal government as part of a trade war, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that he won’t turn over the data or suspend European cloud operations. In fact, he said the company is expanding them. He also said he would sue the Trump administration to protect them, if necessary. Two days after that, Microsoft dropped the big law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which had agreed to give the administration $125 million in free legal work after threats from Trump. Microsoft hired Jenner & Block to take its place — and Jenner & Block sued the Trump administration instead of giving in to it. You might expect that after all that, Trump would have publicly attacked Microsoft or used the power of his office to go after the company. So far, that hasn’t happened. And unlike Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon, Microsoft has thrived since Trump took office. Its stock price inched up from $434 a share just before Trump’s inauguration past $445 this week, while the share prices of the others have all declined, sometimes significantly. Along the way, Microsoft became the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap approaching $3.3 trillion. Gauging by the company’s most recent quarterly results, even better times may be ahead. The New York Times had this to say about the results: “Overall, Microsoft’s results showed unexpected strength in its business. Sales surpassed $70 billion, up 13% from the same period a year earlier. Profit rose to $25.8 billion, up 18%. The results far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Despite the economic uncertainty, the company predicted more strength ahead, saying revenue would surpass $73 billion in the current quarter.” All that said, Microsoft is being investigated by the feds for possible antitrust violations having to do with AI and cloud computing. That investigation, like the others, wasn’t begun by the Trump administration; it was set in motion during the Biden administration. So far, Microsoft’s actions don’t appear to have had any effect on the suit — or the company. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shown that it’s possible for a company to maintain its values under Trump and thrive. Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta should follow suit.

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. The Brother Lode: Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which the SEC recently greenlit to be listed on the NYSE. After a decade-long beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, are the company’s largest shareholders through their holding company J&F Investimentos. The brothers, whom Forbes estimates are worth $4.8 billion each, have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed for about six months from 2017 to 2018. Any one of those issues would have ended most other companies’ prospects of going public on the American market, but following the SEC’s recent decision, JBS is looking to offer shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, pending a shareholder vote later this month. “This time it looks like it’s for real,” says Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, which is not involved in the listing. Over the past two decades, the Batista brothers have turned their family’s South American meat business into a goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue with a presence in nearly every country in the world. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Angus Beef. But given the mountain of scandals, U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have long been opposed to the company going public in America. Just last year, at 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. For years, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics. In 2019 Rubio requested an investigation by a Treasury Department committee into JBS’s acquisitions, and in 2021, he renewed the ask and broadened it to the approximately 250 meat and agribusiness companies owned by the Batista family’s holding company J&F Investimentos. The Treasury Department declined to comment. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight.” But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump retuned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation: “No company has control over the timing of when inaugural committee donation contributions are publicized, and the JBS listing has been underway for approximately two years. The company has internal controls and compliance procedures in place to ensure that all political contributions are made in a transparent and ethical manner, and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” The spokesperson also declined to provide the names of executives at the Inauguration, only confirming “several executives attended inaugural events.” The representative declined to comment on whether JBS, Pilgrim’s Pride or any affiliates donated to the Trump Administration’s transition fund from last summer. In addition to the SEC approval, there have been other federal policy changes in President Trump’s first 100 days that have benefited JBS and the Batistas—most notably, the administration’s decision to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law, which dates back to 1977, prohibits U.S. companies (including subsidiaries owned by foreign companies), citizens, as well as foreigners acting in the U.S., from bribing officials in the U.S. or abroad. It had previously led to JBS parent company J&F Investimentos paying a $128 million criminal fine as part of a 2020 settlement with the Department of Justice in which J&F pleaded guilty to corruption charges. J&F also paid nearly $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC in 2020. At the same time, the Batistas, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. JBS’ spokesperson says that the Trump Administration’s decision “didn’t change any of the obligations contained in J&F’s settlement, which have been fully complied with.” In terms of linking the SEC’s change of heart about JBS’ listing to donations to Trump’s inaugural, it’s difficult to prove a quid pro quo in court, says Brett Kappel, a campaign finance and government ethics attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Harmon Curran, and it’s unlikely a prosecutor would even take the case. “If there were a prosecution, the Justice Department would have to show that there was an agreement that government officials would do certain things in exchange for the contribution,” Kappel says. Although he adds, “the Justice Department could show through circumstantial evidence that the two things were linked. In our judicial system we trust juries to use their common sense to make those decisions." JBS denies any quid pro quo. “As a U.S.-based food company, Pilgrim’s Pride was pleased to support the 2025 inauguration ceremony,” the spokesperson says. “We have a long bipartisan history of participating in the civic process and look forward to working with the Administration to create opportunities for American farmers and provide safe, affordable food for American families.” JBS was founded in 1953 when then-19-year-old Jose Batista Sobrinho, the namesake of the company, began carving up oxen and selling the meat to locals around the family’s small farm in Anapolis, a rural region in Central Brazil. Joesley and Wesley were born into the family business as Brazilian beef started booming in the 1970s. The brothers dropped out of high school to work full-time for JBS, by then a major Brazilian meatpacker, which was then run by Jose Batista, their eldest brother. But in 2005, Jose left JBS for an ill-fated attempt at politics and Joesley and Wesley, then in their thirties, took over. They took JBS public at a valuation equivalent to $800 million on Brazil’s São Paolo-based B3 stock exchange in 2007, which was at the time the most successful debut in the history of its stock market. Soon after going public, the Batistas looked to supersize their business by taking JBS abroad. The Batistas, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission cease-and-desist order from 2020, were willing to buy their way in. According to his testimony to Brazilian investigators in 2017, Joesley had a network of government officials and politicians on his payroll, including a finance minister at the Brazilian development bank BNDES, who received kickbacks for helping finance acquisitions of American assets, including Pilgrim’s Pride. (BNDES, which also became JBS’ second-largest shareholder, has denied allegations of corruption and bribery, citing an independent investigation at the time that found no evidence. A Brazilian federal court also refused to charge JBS with a crime in connection with the bribery.) After Texas-based Pilgrim’s Pride went bankrupt, in 2009 the Batistas targeted America’s second-largest chicken processor, which they viewed as a bargain. For an initial 64% of the company, JBS spent $800 million. The deal had an enterprise value of $2.8 billion with BNDES providing $2 billion in financing. According to the DOJ indictment against J&F, the bribe Joesley Batista deposited into a U.S. bank account for the BNDES finance minister was more than $55 million. JBS eventually secured an estimated nearly $5 billion in total equity and debt financing from BNDES across several U.S. deals, including Pilgrim’s Pride. In all, the Batistas and J&F agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. The DOJ and SEC found evidence of some $150 million in kickbacks. According to the SEC’s 2020 case against JBS, publicly traded Pilgrim’s Pride, which the Batistas eventually amassed an 80% stake in, even became a slush fund for the brothers: “From 2009 to 2015, unbeknownst to Pilgrim’s management, the [Batistas and J&F] carried out the bribery scheme and its funding using, at times, certain JBS operating accounts which contained funds that were commingled with funds obtained from Pilgrim’s through intercompany transfers, special dividend payments, and other means. Pilgrim’s books did not reflect this.” The scheme came crashing down when Brazilian investigators, in the middle of a sweeping country-wide corruption probe in 2017, had Joesley Batista wear a wire to snare the then-President of Brazil, Michel Temer, who Joesley alleged was on the Batistas’ payroll. On the recording, Temer can be heard discussing Joesley giving a bribe to another politician on Temer’s behalf. After the recording leaked, the Brazilian real tanked and there were massive street protests in Brazil. Despite their cooperation, the Batistas didn’t avoid jail time—they ended up serving about six months, starting in September 2017. And as these bribes, and other unrelated bribes to meat inspectors in Brazil, were revealed to the public, their attempts to list JBS in the U.S. were delayed. “There were some rocky years there,” says John Baumgarten, a managing director at Mizuho Group who covers food companies, including JBS. “They had to take a few steps backwards.” In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon. JBS’ spokesperson denies that, and says the company is “deeply committed to zero deforestation in our supply chain and are actively investing in sustainable agricultural practices. We continue to collaborate with our suppliers to promote responsible land use and reduce our shared environmental footprint.” But representatives of the Parakanã people in Brazil allege that JBS illegally exploited the Apyterewa Indigenous Territory in the rainforest by buying cattle raised on cleared acres. According to a letter sent to then-SEC chairman Gary Gensler in 2023 asking for the listing to be blocked, which was obtained by Forbes through a Freedom of Information Act request, community leader Wenatoa said “Our people suffer daily threats from invaders, and JBS is an accomplice in this invasion…We will not be silent as long as our lands, culture and dignity continue to be harmed by irresponsible business practices like this.” Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with HSBC’s Laboy estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS “more resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.” Overall, Laboy sees the listing as a way to rein in JBS. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight,” he says. “More oversight of the market leader intensifies the regulatory pressure on bad behavior in the broader industry." Either way, the Batistas are not going anywhere. Once JBS is listed, the family holding companies, J&F and JBS Participações, which owns nearly 50% as the largest shareholder of JBS, will get the chance to convert its common shares to preferred, increasing the Batistas’ voting power to as much as 90%. While JBS declined to comment on the Batistas’ long-term plans, the move ensures that the family will be involved for years to come. Because of that family control, Laboy believes that “strong independent voices on the board of directors” are a must. But, as it stands, the board of directors under the NYSE-listed company will include Joesley and Wesley Batista, who were forced to leave the board when they were arrested in 2017. They had been banned from leadership roles for years but they both returned to management at J&F in 2020 after a Brazilian judge ordered it, and in 2024 they were both reelected to the JBS board. “A strong board with independent members of unquestionable integrity would be optimal for all shareholders of JBS,” Laboy adds, “including [the Batistas].”

Title: From Fringe to Foundation: Coinbase’s Debut Signals Crypto’s Coming of Age (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

For years, digital assets carried a whiff of skepticism in traditional finance circles – a perceived “taboo stain” that serious institutions were hesitant to touch. Many remembered the early days of Bitcoin’s wild price swings, high-profile exchange hacks, and regulators sounding alarms. Crypto companies struggled for mainstream respect; a large pension fund or bank wouldn’t want to be caught with a crypto exchange on its balance sheet. But Coinbase’s S&P 500 inclusion emphatically wipes away much of that historical stigma. It signals that crypto businesses have matured into credible, profitable enterprises worthy of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Fortune 500 stalwarts. Inclusion in the S&P isn’t arbitrary – a company must meet strict criteria for market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability and sustained profitability. By meeting those standards, Coinbase essentially earned a mainstream seal of approval, demonstrating that a company built on crypto can be as fundamentally sound as any in traditional finance. Just a few years ago, major indices and investors kept digital asset companies at arm’s length. Now we have Indices effectively declaring that at least one crypto firm has “made it” into the upper echelon of public companies. The symbolism is powerful. In practical terms, it means Wall Street’s perception of crypto has undergone a dramatic turnaround. What was once seen as a risky curiosity is now recognized as a permanent fixture. Legacy institutions – from investment funds to brokerage houses – are increasingly engaging with blockchain infrastructure, exploring digital custody solutions, and even trading tokenized assets. With Coinbase now in the same index as banks and tech giants, the message is clear: crypto and digital assets are now a credible part of global finance’s fabric, woven into indexes and portfolios worldwide. Moreover, Coinbase’s induction may pave the way for other digital asset firms to join major indices in the future. It’s a precedent that says crypto companies can graduate from the periphery to the very core of equity markets. The “taboo” has truly been, at least to a large degree, broken. Mainstream Milestones: Wall Street and Payment Giants Embrace Crypto Coinbase ’s S&P 500 debut isn’t happening in isolation. It caps off a series of milestones that have steadily blurred the line between traditional finance (TradFi) and the crypto world. Over the past two years, some of the biggest names in global finance and tech have made decisive moves to integrate digital assets into their offerings, further validating that crypto is here to stay. Consider just a few of these developments: Seriously, the examples are literally endless. I am picking a handful so as to not bore you, the reader to death, but you can read more of my thoughts regarding digital assets every Monday. Adapt or Be Left Behind: A Warning to the Skeptics The convergence of traditional finance and crypto is no longer speculative – it’s structural. And that carries a warning for any institutions still refusing to acknowledge crypto’s rise. In 2025, to ignore crypto is akin to ignoring the internet in 2000 – a recipe for irrelevance. The past year has shown a “join or miss out” dynamic: those who integrated digital assets reaped the benefits of new revenue streams, broader client bases, and improved tech infrastructure, while those who stayed on the sidelines watched innovation pass them by. Regulators and policymakers are also coming around (albeit cautiously), providing clearer frameworks that remove excuses for institutional inaction. With reputable players in the game and safeguards maturing, the barrier to entry for traditional institutions is lower than ever. Let me be clear: The taboo is gone. The credibility is proven. The demand is undeniable. This is no longer a game of maybe's. This is the new reality. Crypto is not an outsider anymore, but an integral part of the financial structure. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 is just the latest sign that the walls are down and a new, hybrid financial era is taking shape. The old skeptics have less and less to point to as justification for shunning digital assets. Final Thought If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em – or better yet, index them. Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 isn’t just a victory for one company – it’s a milestone for an entire industry. The bulls of Wall Street and the bulls of crypto are finally running in the same direction. And those still waiting for crypto to “go away” might want to check the index — it’s already here.

Title: VanEck to compete with BlackRock in tokenized US Treasuries race, launching on Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Avalanche

VanEck’s VBILL fund marks a new era for qualified investors with strategic multi-chain deployment and stablecoin integration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Traditional finance heavyweight VanEck has entered the real-world asset (RWA) arena with the launch of VBILL, a tokenized fund offering exposure to short-term U.S. Treasuries across Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Solana. The fund marks a significant step in the institutionalization of tokenized finance, as asset managers race to offer blockchain-native, yield-generating alternatives to crypto-native treasuries. Structured as a BVI-domiciled fund, VBILL is managed by Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers, with Securitize acting as the placement agent. The fund is open to qualified investors only, with a $100,000 minimum investment across most supported chains and a $1 million minimum on Ethereum. Under the hood, the fund holds U.S. Treasury bills, custodied by State Street Bank & Trust, with on-chain NAV data supplied daily via RedStone oracles. Subscriptions and redemptions occur via USDC, and token transfers across blockchains are made possible using the Wormhole protocol. VBILL also features atomic redemption into Agora’s AUSD stablecoin, allowing for frictionless liquidity pathways between yield and stablecoin markets. “By bringing U.S. Treasuries on-chain, we are providing investors with a secure, transparent, and liquid tool for cash management,” said Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Assets Product at VanEck. VanEck’s move follows BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, launched in March 2024, which brought the world’s largest asset manager into the tokenization race. With VBILL, VanEck goes a step further by deploying across four chains from day one, a signal of growing confidence in cross-chain infrastructure. The tokenized T-bill sector has grown explosively, recently surpassing $6.8 billion in total value locked, a more than 5x increase year-over-year. VanEck’s launch appears to be both a strategic counter to BUIDL and an effort to offer more flexibility and composability to crypto-native treasury desks and stablecoin providers. Despite its blockchain-native architecture, VBILL is limited to accredited investors via exemptions under Regulation D and Rule 506(c). Retail participation remains out of reach, and the fund’s $100,000+ ticket size reinforces its institutional focus. While State Street custody provides traditional security guarantees, the product still inherits smart contract risk and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities. Key open questions remain around redemption queues and liquidity provisioning during market stress, especially for users accessing the fund across different blockchain environments. “This collaboration merges the best of Securitize’s tokenization model with VanEck’s expertise… demonstrating tokenization’s ability to create new market opportunities,” said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize. With BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and now VanEck diving into the RWA space, tokenized money-market products are quickly becoming a new battleground for traditional asset managers. Each is experimenting with different blends of on-chain transparency, liquidity access, and compliance guardrails to capture a growing pool of crypto-native capital seeking real-world yield. VBILL’s multi-chain rollout, stablecoin integration, and institutional pedigree could make it a standout choice for crypto treasurers seeking safe yield with composability. As tokenization of risk-free assets gains traction, the line between TradFi and DeFi continues to blur, and the world’s safest collateral is now just a smart contract away.

Title: eToro locks in $4.2B valuation, tests IPO waters with Nasdaq listing
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/etoro-locks-in-4-2b-valuation-tests-ipo-waters-with-nasdaq-listing/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T05:21:10Z

The stock brokerage and burgeoning crypto platform eToro is stepping into the Wall Street spotlight, having priced its initial public offering at $52 per share. This move signals the company’s readiness to gauge investor appetite for new listings in a market still finding its footing after a period of volatility. The Israel-based firm successfully raised nearly $310 million through the sale of almost 6 million shares, a transaction that pegs the company’s valuation at approximately $4.2 billion. This pricing lands above its initially targeted range of $46 to $50 per share. Alongside the company’s offering, existing investors are also divesting an additional tranche of nearly 6 million shares, further shaping the public float. The path to this moment has been paved with cautious optimism. The IPO market had shown signs of a potential resurgence earlier in the year, particularly following President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, which some hoped would break a prolonged drought influenced by rising interest rates and persistent inflationary concerns. Indeed, CoreWeave’s successful March debut provided a glimmer of hope for other aspiring public companies, including eToro, online lending giant Klarna, and ticket reseller StubHub. However, this nascent recovery faced headwinds. “Tariff uncertainty temporarily stalled those plans,” the original article noted, capturing a period of market jitters. Consequently, eToro, which had filed for its IPO in March, alongside Klarna and StubHub, opted to shelve its immediate ambitions as markets grappled with the implications of trade policy shifts. Now, as eToro prepares for its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol ETOR, its performance may serve as a significant litmus test for the broader public market’s willingness to embrace risk. The IPO landscape is showing renewed activity; digital physical therapy company Hinge Health has commenced its IPO roadshow, revealing in a Tuesday filing its intention to raise up to $437 million. Also on Tuesday, fintech innovator Chime submitted its prospectus to the SEC, indicating its own public market aspirations. This follows the April move by another trading application, Webull, which went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Founded in 2007 by brothers Yoni and Ronen Assia along with David Ring, eToro operates in a competitive landscape, challenging established players like Robinhood. Its revenue model is built on fees tied to trading activities, such as spreads on buy and sell orders, and non-trading operations including withdrawals and currency conversions. The company’s financial trajectory has been notable, with net income soaring almost thirteenfold last year to $192.4 million, a substantial increase from $15.3 million the previous year. A significant driver of this growth has been its expanding crypto business. Revenue from cryptoassets more than tripled to exceed $12 million in 2024, and crypto-related activities accounted for a quarter of its net trading contribution last year, up sharply from 10% in the prior year. This isn’t eToro’s maiden voyage into the public offering process. “In 2022, the company scrapped plans to hit the market through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) during a sharp downturn in equity markets,” the source material highlighted. That earlier deal would have valued eToro at a considerably higher figure of more than $10 billion. Despite the previous setback, CEO Yoni Assia remained committed to a public listing. He told CNBC early last year that eToro was still aiming for a market debut but was “evaluating the right opportunity” while building relationships with exchanges, including the Nasdaq. “We definitely are eyeing the public markets,” Assia stated at the time. “I definitely see us becoming eventually a public company.” Adding a vote of confidence to the current offering, eToro disclosed in its prospectus that investment behemoth BlackRock had “expressed interest in buying $100 million in shares at the IPO price.” The company further detailed its plan to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives slated to sell an additional 5 million. The underwriting syndicate for this significant financial maneuver includes industry heavyweights Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp praises Saudi engineers and takes a swipe at Europe, saying it has 'given up' on AI

At an investment forum in Riyadh, Alex Karp, CEO of defense tech company Palantir Technologies, praised Saudi engineers for meritocracy and patriotism — and took a swipe at Europe over its slow AI adoption. "You're seeing a receptivity in this region, especially in the kingdom," Karp said at the Saudi-US Investment Forum on Tuesday. "But the receptivity is on the back of people who have a deep tradition in engineering excellence and, quite frankly, believe in their own future." Karp was addressing a request from panel host and CNBC anchor Sara Eisen to expand upon a previous comment that the countries and regions that are best utilizing AI right now are the US and the Middle East. "Obviously, the great contradistinction here is Europe, where, you know, it's like people have given up, and we — I really hope that turns around in Europe," he added. The talk came as President Donald Trump received a royal welcome with golden chairs and Arabian horses in Riyadh on Tuesday as he kicked off his Gulf tour. Flanked by executives from Google, Nvidia, BlackRock, and others to discuss AI, defense, and energy with Saudi officials, Trump said he aims to secure $1 trillion in deals. Based on an October 2024 report published by QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, European organizations lag behind their US counterparts by 45 to 70% in terms of AI adoption. And while Europe leads in producing AI semiconductor equipment — machinery and tools used to make semiconductors — the report said that Europe has below 5% market share in areas like raw materials, cloud infrastructure, and supercomputers. "Opportunity remains wide open, but Europe is starting from a disadvantage," the report QuantumBlack wrote. Europe is also known for much more stringent AI regulations. On August 1, 2024, Europe enacted the AI Act, the first-ever legal framework on AI, and established an AI office to oversee the implementation of these regulations. The AI Act is just one part of a wider package of measures that the EU said ensures "trustworthy AI," which explicitly banned practices such as AI-based manipulation and deception, real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in public spaces, and individual criminal offense risk assessment. According to the AI Act, ways of using AI, such as robot-assisted surgery and credit scoring, are also categorized as "high-risk" and subjected to strict scrutiny. The best-known European AI company that raised the most amount of funds is French AI startup Mistral, which is backed by over €1 billion in funding. Dubbed as Europe's answer to OpenAI, the company has recently ruled out acquisition and is eyeing an IPO while pushing its open-source AI models and generative chatbot "Le Chat" into new markets.

Title: Alternative investments see sharp surge, says Shiv Gupta of Sanctum Wealth

What are the factors driving the momentum? The rebound in Indian equities, which includes some opportunistic buying, has been driven by strong investor confidence in India’s economic fundamentals, long-term growth story, and relative insulation from global tariff disruptions. That said, markets have yet to fully work out the potential second-order effects of trade disruptions. These, combined with broader macro uncertainties, could still generate volatility. On valuations, while large-cap stocks are trading near historical averages, mid- and small-cap segments remain elevated at approximately 15 per cent and 30 per cent above their respective long-term averages. What types of products are high net-worth investors gravitating to? High-net-worth investors are becoming more sophisticated and seeking better diversification, higher yields, tax efficiency, and exposure to new asset classes. As a result, interest in equities has remained steady, debt allocations are more selective, and alternative investments are seeing a massive surge. Within alternatives, HNIs are increasingly allocating to private markets through PE and VC funds and, sometimes, through direct private deals. On the debt side, high-yield private credit is popular for its attractive 13-15 per cent yields, while venture debt offers similar returns with added upside from equity warrants. We also see interest in commercial real estate and infrastructure through AIFs and REITs/INVITs. What are your views on gold as an asset class? In Sanctum’s view, gold is an essential component of any asset allocation strategy, given its low correlation with other assets, role as an inflation hedge, and historical performance during geopolitical or macroeconomic stress. These reasons, combined with strong central bank demand and a shift in allocations away from US Treasuries more recently, have helped gold appreciate about 55% over the past couple of years. While a near-term correction is probable after such a strong rally, any pullback would be a good opportunity for under-allocated portfolios or longer-term investors to build exposure. How are clients viewing overseas investing at this juncture? As HNI families become increasingly global, often with children studying or residing abroad, interest in international investing has grown steadily. Traditionally, Indian investors have favoured overseas equities over debt, with the latter mainly used for liquidity management. Real estate overseas continues to appeal, particularly for personal use, but limited leverage options under LRS have been a constraint. Given current global uncertainty and volatility in US bond yields, many investors are adopting a cautious, wait-and-watch stance. How has the wealth management industry grown in recent years? What’s the outlook? India’s wealth management industry has grown at an impressive 15–20% annually in recent years, driven by massive wealth creation, buoyant markets, financialization of savings, expanding product offerings, and supportive regulation. Established firms have scaled significantly, and a spate of new entrants has emerged. The outlook remains strong. Entry barriers remain relatively low, so we may see more players enter. However, building a scaled and profitable franchise can take a long time. With rising competition and margin pressures, some consolidation is likely. What are the trends and challenges impacting Sanctum Wealth and the industry at large? Several structural forces are driving growth. Economic expansion and asset price appreciation are fueling wealth creation. Regulatory evolution has helped widen the product universe, especially in alternatives. There’s a growing democratization of access to sophisticated strategies. And while still early, technology, particularly AI, offers transformative potential. Competitive intensity is rising, and margins are under pressure. There is a shortage of skilled talent, made worse by limited investment in training and development. This leads to high churn and cost inflation. Meanwhile, the slow adoption of digital solutions is holding back productivity gains. That said, technology remains a significant opportunity if deployed strategically and with scale. How have costs and the regulatory landscape changed, and how has it impacted margins? On balance, regulation has been a long-term positive, creating a stronger, more transparent framework that has improved trust and enabled product innovation. However, short-term pressures are real. Fee caps, incentive guidelines, advice segregation rules, and tighter oversight of manager compensation have compressed margins. At the same time, talent scarcity has pushed compensation costs higher. Firms that succeed in combining operational efficiency with robust compliance and governance will be best positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape.

Posted on 05/13/2025 5:07:00 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump got the royal treatment on his first stop in Saudi Arabia, as white Arabian horses flanked his motorcade — with adviser Elon Musk in tow. Dozens of Saudis rode on horseback carrying US and Saudi flags as Trump’s motorcade peeled into the Royal Court, where he got a warm welcome before going to a lunch in the palace adorned with chandeliers and marble floors. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump told reporters after his arrival, referring to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a friend. He later recalled how “impressed” he was when he first met the 31-year-old MbS back in 2017 during their first visit, and how they quickly became friends. “I like visiting with you, and we’ve known each other very well, and I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said. The president was escorted into the country by six Saudi F-15s bracketing Air Force One, got a 21-gun salute on arrival, and was met with the level of pomp and circumstance that he was met with during his first trip to the kingdom in his first term. The lunch was attended by members of the Saudi government — as well as a number of tech billionaires and business leaders, including Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, and more. Other tech guests included Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, Google CIO Ruth Porat, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, LinkedIn executive chairman Reid Hoffman — and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. Musk — who has taken one step back from the Department of Government Efficiency and is largely no longer working from the White House — was spotted shaking hands with MbS.

Title: SEC punts decision on crypto ETFs again, final rulings anticipated later in 2025

The regulator postponed decisions on three crypto-related ETFs, while acknowledging 21shares' Dogecoin ETF filing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission postponed decisions on multiple crypto-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on May 13, including those filed by Grayscale and BlackRock. The delays extend the agency’s review timeline and align with expectations that it will grant no approvals before the final quarter of 2025. Grayscale’s proposed spot ETFs for Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) were deferred. The new filing deadlines for both are August 11 and October 10. The SEC also delayed action on BlackRock’s request to enable in-kind redemptions for its approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. BlackRock’s request has no updated deadline, which centers on technical mechanics rather than initial approval. Separately, the SEC acknowledged the 19b-4 filing for a 21Shares spot Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF, initiating the official review timeline for the product. This filing begins the countdown toward an eventual decision under the agency’s statutory schedule. The agency’s latest moves follow a broader pattern of staggered reviews across more than 70 crypto ETF proposals, which remain in various evaluation stages. On April 29, the SEC delayed decisions on five other crypto-related ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas described the current cycle of delays as routine. Seyffart said the delay was “expected,” and most of the affected products face final deadlines no earlier than October. Balchunas added that the SEC is unlikely to issue substantive approvals until recently confirmed Chair Paul Atkins completes internal meetings and strategy sessions with staff. He said: “They’ve been taking outside meetings with people. Probably coming up with a strategy. After that, likely approvals.” SEC decisions on crypto ETF applications follow a multi-stage statutory process based on the publication of proposed rule changes in the Federal Register. The agency typically operates on review intervals of 45, 90, 180, and 240 days, allowing multiple opportunities to delay decisions before reaching a final deadline. The regulator’s recent actions are consistent with its historical practice of extending reviews to the full statutory limits before issuing decisions. No ETF in this group faces a final deadline before late in the third quarter, leaving applicants and investors awaiting further clarity on the regulatory trajectory for crypto-linked investment vehicles.

Title: New True chief vows to pay firm's 1st dividend in 25 years
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3024911/new-true-chief-vows-to-pay-firms-1st-dividend-in-25-years
Time Published: 2025-05-13T22:36:00Z
Full Content:
The newly appointed group chief executive of True Corporation has outlined his mission for the first 100 days, writing a new chapter for the telecom company by continuing its profitability, driving operations of trusted services, and strengthening data centre development. Sigve Brekke vowed True would pay a dividend in 2025 for the first time in more than 25 years as the company has retired all accumulated losses. He also stressed the need to increase True's revenue. The company reported net profit after tax of 1.6 billion baht for the first quarter of 2025, marking a milestone turnaround within two years of its amalgamation with Total Access Communication (dtac). Excluding the impact from one-off items, the normalised profit for the first quarter was 4.3 billion baht. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation have continued to improve since the merger, driven by a reduction in operational expenses from performance focus and financial discipline, along with ongoing benefits from synergies. "Bringing together True and dtac was an astonishing feat. We united two industry leaders with a sharp focus on performance, financial discipline and synergies, we modernised our networks, and infused AI [artificial intelligence] into customer touchpoints," said Mr Brekke. However, he said he is not satisfied with net profit and performance as the company has to compete with a rival and improve service standards. In the first quarter this year, the company's mobile subscribers declined by 638,000, or 1.3% from the previous quarter, totalling 48.8 million. Mobile subscribers declined 4.4% year-on-year due to the focus on quality subscriber acquisition in 2024, said Mr Brekke. Mobile postpaid subscribers increased 0.2% quarter-on-quarter to 15.3 million for the period, while mobile prepaid subscribers declined by 2.0%, tallying 33.5 million due to seasonality, according to True. Online subscribers increased 0.7% quarter-on-quarter to 3.8 million, while 5G subscribers tallied 14.2 million. Mr Brekke said increasing True's prepaid subscribers and revenue is a crucial mission for the company, particularly as it competes with rival Advanced Info Service (AIS). He started as group chief executive of True on March 11. On March 1, Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group appointed the Norwegian as executive chairman of the telecom and digital business. Mr Brekke said CP Group, through its subsidiary True Internet Data Centre, recently partnered with Global Infrastructure Partners under BlackRock in a move to jointly invest in a digital infrastructure project worth between US$3-5 billion to serve Thailand's digital economy. Strengthening data centre development through partnerships is one of Mr Brekke's missions. "A merger is a marathon, but we have to sprint," he said. Mr Brekke unveiled three strategic moves to fuel the company's growth, focusing on customers, leveraging technology, and empowering staff. The company will ensure a good customer experience by accelerating the integration of systems between True and dtac, modernising and expanding service centres, and delivering a reliable and future-proof network, he said. True will raise awareness among businesses and the public about the potential of AI to stimulate widespread adoption, said Mr Brekke. The company also aims to create a unified organisational culture, ensuring that every approach places the customer at the heart of everything it does.

Title: SEC delays Solana and Litecoin ETFs as Dogecoin and BlackRock proposals enter public comment

Share this article The US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF today, while opening public comment periods for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF redemption model and the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The SEC extended its review of the Grayscale Solana Trust to evaluate whether the listing meets investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. If approved, the trust would hold SOL and trade on NYSE Arca. It also delayed a decision on the Grayscale Litecoin Trust, instituting proceedings to further assess whether the listing aligns with requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. Both Solana and Litecoin filings now face extended timelines as the agency continues its review. Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s filing to amend BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is now open for public comment. The proposed change would allow the fund to support in-kind redemptions, meaning authorized participants could create or redeem shares using Bitcoin directly rather than cash. The SEC initially approved the fund in January with a cash-only redemption mechanism. The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF has also entered its public comment phase following a filing to list under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), which covers commodity-based trust shares. The ETF plans to track DOGE prices using a CF Benchmarks index and aims to provide Dogecoin exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. The SEC’s recent actions come as the agency reassesses crypto product listings under new Chair Paul Atkins. The commission has dismissed several enforcement cases and increased public engagement through crypto-focused roundtables since President Trump took office.

May 13, 2025 17:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Microsoft Layoffs Impact 7,000 Workers As Company Adjusts For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/05/13/microsoft-layoffs-impact-7000-workers-as-company-adjusts-for-ai/
Time Published: 2025-05-13T20:59:39Z

ByChris Westfall ByChris Westfall, Contributor. Layoffs driven by AI investment will effect more than 6,000 employees. In a move signaling a significant strategic pivot, Microsoft today announced a reduction of its workforce by more than 6,000 employees, representing about 3% of its total headcount. While such news often triggers concerns about automation and job displacement due to artificial intelligence, the company indicated a different rationale: This adjustment is a calculated step to optimize resources and ensure continued robust investment in Microsoft’s burgeoning AI platform. The decision to streamline certain operations (and create bottom-line impact) is designed to free up capital to drive the company’s AI-centric strategy. “We have made huge investments in AI because we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industry and society, and because we’re committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly," the company has previously shared on its website. Reuters reports that it is this investment in new AI initiatives, not the AI technology itself, that has caused the company to reduce its staff. However, CEO Satya Nadella told a Silicon Valley audience that “maybe 20, 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today, and some of our projects, are probably all written by software.” In that same conversation, on stage with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nadella described his vision for Microsoft as a ”distillation factory", where they would take large, general purpose AI models and shrink them down into smaller, specialized and even task-specific models. Nadella has often spoken of the “democratization of AI” and his plans for the technology. Indeed, efforts are underway to target businesses with AI-powered tools and platforms, as the company embeds AI capabilities into mainstay products like Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics365. And Wall Street has responded in a positive way. Microsoft’s gross profit margins have consistently been in the high 60’s-low 70% range over the last few years, making the stock a favorite for institutional investors. On Monday, Microsoft shares ended trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. (They closed at a record $467.56 last July). The company recently reported quarterly revenues of $70.07 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. For comparison, Nadella has said the company will spend $80 billion in fiscal year 2025 on AI-related efforts. Analyst Gil Luria says that headcount reduction is a natural result of those kinds of capital investment numbers, hinting that more layoffs might be ahead. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000 in order to make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures,” Luria said, according to Reuters. The displaced workforce includes about 1,985 workers in Washington state, where the company is headquartered. Overall, there are 228,000 workers at the company. The layoff news for these laid off workers can’t be easy, as the trend in tech layoffs continues. Corrected, May 14: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Microsoft employees likely to be cut; it’s more than 6,000, or less than 3% of the company’s workforce.

Title: Stocks just erased all of this year’s losses as investors welcome trade progress

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The S&P 500 benchmark stock index hit another milestone in its remarkable march higher from the brink of a bear market in recent weeks: It has now erased all its losses for this year. US stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors digested cooling inflation data and easing trade tensions between the United States and China. The Dow closed lower by 270 points, or 0.64%. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 rose 0.72% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.61%. For the year, the Dow is still down 0.95% and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.56% this year. Wall Street got a major boost on Monday after Washington and Beijing brokered an agreement to substantially lower tariffs for 90 days. Stocks rose further on Tuesday as new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a surprising cooldown in annual inflation ahead of the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Consumer prices in April recorded their lowest annual increase since February 2021. Stocks have been on a tear for the past month after Trump began to change his tune on tariffs, announcing carve-outs for some tariffs on China and the prospect of inking some trade deals. “Fears of slowing growth and a recession caused by punitive tariffs drove markets lower in the first week of April, but they’ve rebounded on the heels of a tariff pause and a Chinese trade breakthrough, and now a better-than-expected inflation report removes the last big overhang for the market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, in a Tuesday note. Nvidia (NVDA) surged 5.63% Tuesday after the chip giant announced it would partner with Saudi Arabia on artificial intelligence initiatives. The Dow was the only index that fell on Tuesday. It was largely weighed down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which sank 17.8% after the company suspended its earnings guidance and CEO Andrew Witty said he would step down for personal reasons. The Dow is weighted by share prices, and UnitedHealth has a significant influence on the index’s performance. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Happy 20-year anniversary, Leeroy Jenkins!

We’re still shouting his name two decades later by Kyle Burke Twenty years ago, the name Leeroy Jenkins rang through the halls of Upper Blackrock Spire, and now it echoes through eternity. On May 11, 2005, the famous “Leeroy!!” video was posted to WarcraftMovies, a website dedicated to World of Warcraft machinima. The video came from a guild called Pals for Life. In it, the guild leader addressed the group in a semi-serious tone, asking after coming up with a detailed plan, “Can you give me a number crunch real quick?” In response, the apparent number-crunching guy laid down the first meme of the video, “I’m coming up with 32.33 repeating, of course, percentage of survival.” Don’t ever tell Leroy the odds, because that’s when he declared, “Times up,” and delivered a battlecry for the ages, “Leeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins!!!” Soon after charging in from an AFK state, Leeroy Jenkins stepped on a bunch of dragon eggs that spawned hatchlings, killing everybody in the room. When the dust settled a bit, Leeroy was berated, “Goddamn it, Leeroy,” one said, another adding in, “You moron.” Taking things in stride, Leeroy responded with words of wisdom, “At least I have chicken.” It’s gone down in history as a defining moment for viral clips while bringing some gaming culture into the mainstream. The list of pop culture references to Leeroy Jenkins includes a Family Guy bit, trivia on Jeopardy!, a How I Met Your Mother impersonation, a Howard Stern segment, and even U.S. House Rep. Jared Huffman using the rallying call during a Speaker of the House vote. Blizzard kept Leeroy Jenkins alive by turning him into a staple Hearthstone card, rewarding the “Jenkins” title for a World of Warcraft achievement, and making a Leeroy Jenkins NPC voiced by Ben Schulz (the real Leeroy Jenkins) in the Warlords of Draenor expansion. Kotaku confirmed in 2017 that the beloved clip was staged as a comedy skit by the Pals for Life guild after much speculation about its authenticity. Ben Vinson, the video recorder (not Leeroy himself), said, “We didn’t think anyone would believe it was real, we thought it was so obviously satire, but we were wrong.” I guess everyone just wants to believe that charging headfirst into danger — chicken in hand — is the best way to go down.

Title: Waldencast Reports Q1 2025 Financial Results

May 13, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Waldencast plc. Waldencast plc. Q1 Net Revenue of $65.4 million, (4.1)% decline from Q1 202476.4% Adjusted Gross Margin, an improvement of 10 basis points$4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA LONDON, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waldencast plc (NASDAQ: WALD) (“Waldencast” or the “Company”), a global multi-brand beauty and wellness platform, today reported operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 (“Q1 2025”) on Form 6-K to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are also available on our investor relations site at http://ir.waldencast.com/. Michel Brousset, Waldencast Founder and CEO, said: “As anticipated, in Q1 2025, Milk Makeup results were impacted by the cycling of the very successful launch of Jellies in Q1 2024, as well as the significant inventory reduction at the retail level versus a year ago.” “Despite a broader slowdown in the prestige beauty category in the U.S., Milk Makeup ended the quarter on a very strong note, fueled by the highly successful launch of Hydro Grip Gel Tint, which sold out shortly after release. We are also very pleased with the brand’s entry into Ulta Beauty, with retail sales beginning in late February. Both initiatives exceeded expectations and contributed to the brand’s high single-digit growth in U.S. retail sales. This solid domestic performance was offset by the contraction of international sales, which faced a difficult comparison against last year’s Q1 distribution expansion, as well as inventory reduction by retail partners. In Q1, Milk Makeup partnered with Nike Running in North America for the Nike After Dark Tour in Los Angeles, bringing sport and self-expression together to keep expanding reach and deepen community engagement.” “The Obagi Medical brand delivered a solid performance in the first quarter, although out of stocks in some key SKUs dampened volume growth. We are accelerating ongoing efforts to transform our supply chain—consolidating third party logistics partners and enhancing operational capabilities—to improve fulfillment, increase reliability, and support long-term, scalable growth.” “Despite a difficult quarter, we continue to increase our investments in marketing, up in the high teens, to fuel brand equity and set a strong foundation for delivering our long-term ambitions, starting with our 2025 objectives.” “We are confident in our ability to deliver a stronger performance throughout the remainder of the year, beginning in Q2. Key drivers include a robust pipeline of breakthrough innovation at both Milk Makeup and Obagi Medical, combined with restocking of Hydro Grip Gel Tint which is expected to fuel continued consumer demand. We also anticipate a meaningful uplift in Milk Makeup volumes from the successful Ulta Beauty launch. Additionally, ongoing improvements from Obagi Medical’s supply chain restructuring are expected to enhance fulfillment rates and operational resilience,” concluded Mr. Brousset. Q1 2025 Results Overview Please refer to the definitions and reconciliations set out further in this release with respect to certain adjusted non-GAAP measures discussed below which are included to provide an easier understanding of the underlying performance of the business, but should not be seen as a substitute for the U.S. GAAP numbers presented in this release. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024: Net Revenue decreased 4.1% year-over-year to $65.4 million. Gross Profit was $47.2 million, while Adjusted Gross Profit totaled $50.0 million, or 76.4% of net revenue, an expansion of 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Net Loss for Q1 2025 was $20.7 million primarily driven by Depreciation and Financial charges. Non-recurring legal and advisory expenses totaled $1.5 million, continuing their decline from prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 million, or 6.7% of net revenue. The year-over-year decline reflects sustained investments in sales and marketing, and G&A deleverage stemming from lower revenue. Liquidity: As previously announced, during Q1, Waldencast secured a new $205 million five-year credit facility, comprising a $175 million term loan and a $30 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”). This refinancing replaces the previous bank loans, enhances financial flexibility, and extends the Company’s debt maturity profile to March 2030, supporting long-term strategic priorities. As of March 31, 2025, the Company held $10.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $172.1 million in net debt, and approximately $22.5 million in available capacity under the RCF. The increase in net debt during the quarter is primarily due to refinancing-related costs. Cash consumption reflects lower Adjusted EBITDA and an inventory build-up to support expected sales growth in future quarters. Outstanding Shares: As of April 30, 2025, we had 123,011,239 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 112,644,711 Class A shares and 10,366,528 Class B shares. As of December 31, 2024, we had 122,692,968 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 112,026,440 Class A shares and 10,666,528 Class B shares. First Quarter 2025 Brand Highlights: Obagi Medical: Milk Makeup: Fiscal 2025 Outlook: While mindful of the broader macroeconomic environment and assuming no further material changes to current tariffs, including the latest updates on China, we remain confident that our strategic initiatives position us well to deliver on our full-year guidance of mid-teens net revenue growth and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-to-high teens. Given our high gross margin business model and limited reliance on Asian sourcing, we expect a limited increase in cost of goods with any necessary price adjustments (likely in the low-to-mid single digits) to offset the announced tariff scenario. Conference Call and Webcast Information Waldencast will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results on Wednesday, May 14, 2025, at 8:30 AM EDT for the period ended March 31, 2025. Those interested in participating in the conference call are invited to dial (877) 704-4453. International callers may dial (201) 389-0920.

A replay of the webcast will remain available on the website until our next conference call. The information accessible on, or through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this release. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Waldencast separately reports financial results on the basis of the measures set out and defined below which are non-GAAP financial measures. Waldencast believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Waldencast believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These non-GAAP measures also provide perspective on how Waldencast’s management evaluates and monitors the performance of the business. There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from GAAP financial measures such as net income/loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to definitions set out in the release and the tables included in this release for a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as GAAP gross profit excluding the impact of amortization of the supply agreement and formulation intangible assets, and the amortization of the fair value of the related party liability from the Obagi Medical China Business, which was not acquired by Waldencast at the time of the business combination with Obagi Medical and Milk Makeup (the “Business Combination”). The Adjusted Gross Profit reconciliation by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by GAAP Net Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest income or expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the items as described in the reconciliation below. We believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP because management believes they are non-core to our regular business. These include non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, the amortization and release of fair value of the related party liability to the Obagi Medical China Business, change in fair value of assets and liabilities, and foreign currency translation loss (gain). In addition, adjustments include expenses that are not related to our underlying business performance including (1) legal, advisory and consultant fees related to the financial restatement of previously issued financial statements and associated regulatory investigation, and (2) other non-recurring costs, primarily legal settlement costs and restructuring costs. The Adjusted EBITDA by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. The Adjusted EBITDA Margin reconciliation by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Net Debt Position is defined as the principal outstanding for the 2022 term loan and 2022 revolving credit facility minus the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2025.

Joining President Donald Trump and top US and Saudi officials for lunch in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday are dozens of business leaders from some of America’s largest companies. The executives — from tech firms, banks, consumer groups and other industries, including representatives of four of the 10 biggest US companies by market value — may be there to pitch for business from deep-pocketed Saudi investors, businesses and government departments. Their companies are also dealing with the tariffs imposed by Trump on US trading partners, so the trip is an opportunity to lobby top Trump officials, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on trade policy. Saudi Arabia has emerged as one of the world’s largest investors in artificial intelligence, an effort to diversify the oil-rich nation’s economy and give it influence over one of the hottest sectors in the business world. Notable AI players at the lunch include Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT parent OpenAI; Jensen Huang, the leader of advanced chipmaker Nvidia; Ruth Porat, chief investment officer of Alphabet, Google’s parent company; and Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon, which is a major provider of cloud-computing services. There is also Elon Musk, who, in addition to overseeing Trump’s effort to slash the size of the federal government, also runs Tesla, SpaceX and his own AI company called xAI, which is in talks for new financing that could value the firm at as much as $120 billion. Advertisement The vast sums of money that Saudi Arabia is spending on technology, infrastructure and other priorities have made the country a popular destination for financial executives seeking to advise the kingdom and its companies. Top financial leaders at the lunch include Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jane Fraser of Citigroup.

May 13, 2025 15:16 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant keeps getting better. From setting timers to controlling your smart home, these are the best commands to make the most of your Echo devices. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa has evolved far beyond the simple talking speaker that launched more than a decade ago. Like Siri on your iPhone, playing music or checking weather updates is fine, but Alexa is capable of so much more -- and it's getting smarter all the time. Today's Alexa can handle sophisticated voice commands without tripping itself up, control your Fire TV devices, manage daily routines and transform your home into a fully automated smart environment from the future. As we move through spring cleaning season, these new and improved capabilities can be invaluable in helping you organize your home and schedule, especially with Amazon's new, smarter Alexa Plus with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Markets surged yesterday (May 12) on news of a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, with the S&P 500 climbing to its highest level in months. But BlackRock CEO Larry Fink remains wary of the economic turbulence tariffs could still bring. “There’s going to be a lot of volatility until we have greater certainty as to what is the new equilibrium,” the billionaire said today (May 13) at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh.

That said, he believes the path forward is becoming clearer. “The equilibrium is probably sooner than we thought maybe two to three weeks ago,” he added. The U.S. and China agreed yesterday to a 90-day pause on tariff escalation, scaling back their respective duties: U.S. tariffs are dropping from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China’s will decline from 125 percent to 10 percent. Despite the reprieve, investors remain cautious amid ongoing global economic uncertainty, with many opting for defensive strategies such as holding cash. “When there is that uncertainty, you’re going to keep more and more money in cash, and that’s what we’ve witnessed,” Fink said, noting that this is a global phenomenon. In Europe, he pointed out, 12 trillion euros are currently held in bank accounts, while U.S. money market funds are sitting on $11 trillion. Fink also emphasized that tackling economic uncertainty must include addressing the U.S.’s ballooning deficit—something he’s warned about in the past. “Let’s be clear: the U.S. deficits are an issue,” Fink said. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter. To reach a sustainable 3 percent growth rate, Fink said, the country will need to lean more heavily on private investment.

We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation. An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI, written in Golang An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI command, written in Golang. Install unified from go: Set your UniFi API key Try it out: If all goes well, you should see something like: Note that the output is valid JSON, just like the UniFi applications produce. --debug is a helpful flag if you'd like to see more information about unified's operation. Log output is printed to stderr by default. This way logging doesn't interfere with parsing of unified's regular stdout output. unified has a full help system accessible through the --help flag. To access the Network API you will use: and for the Protect API use: unified can be configured via a yaml file: Which can be located at any of the following: Or you can manually specify which config file to use with the --config flag. Learn how to generate an API key from UniFi's official documentation. Network and Protect are "Local Applications". Warning Your API key is a sensitive secret! Please keep it securely stored. It gives FULL API access to your UniFi applications. If you need to revoke an API key navigate to your UniFi application and then to your Admin user: Settings -> Admins & User -> Select Admin account associated with the API key -> Click on API Key -> Remove. You can always generate a new API key if necessary. Now, you can pass your API key to unified in one of two ways: To instantiate a client you should call client.NewClient: Access to actual API client calls is mediated through NetworkV1 and ProtectV1 interfaces. Like so: These interfaces strive to closely mirror the actual APIs exposed by the Network and Protect applications. Protect's API has a couple of interesting endpoints which allow a client to subscribe to a Websocket event stream. The ProtectV1 interface exposes a pair of methods which provide easy access to those streams as golang channels: and while it's certainly do-able to consume those event channels, unified also provides a handler for each event type that makes consuming and re-acting to these events even easier. Here's a brief example of using ProtectEventStreamHandler: A nearly-identical struct exists to handle ProtectDeviceEvents: ProtectDeviceEventStreamHandler. doorbell.go is a full example of using a stream handler. Example programs can be built via: Full Protect API support is planned in short order. After the initial versioned release of this project, work will proceed towards full Protect V1 API support. As well as a full v1.0.0 release. Reference documentation through godoc is also a priority before a v1.0.0 release. Access API might be supported in a future release. Contributions welcome here. Unifi's provided TLS certificates are self-signed and do not sign for the unifi hostname. They do sign for unifi.local, but the default DNS configuration for my UDM Pro does not seem to add an entry for unifi.local. Therefore TLS verification generally fails when https protocol connections are attemped. unified defaults to TLS verification being off. In short, at least two general issues need to be solved to enable TLS verification by default: I'd like to find an easy way to solve these two issues and re-enable TLS verification by default before a full v1.0.0 release. UniFi Network API V1 is fully supported as of Network application version "9.1.120". UniFi Protect API is only partially supported, with the following endpoints supported: UniFi Access API is not yet supported. Contributions are welcome! Before submiting any PRs, please ensure your commits build and lint. Also, take care to test any changes, and ideally submit unit tests or integration tests which cover your changes. PRs must pass all CI in order to be considered acceptable to merge. If you'd like to contribute a feature or API support that doesn't yet exist, please communicate your intention through a new or existing GitHub issue. Let's try to avoid duplicating work, and make sure the work aligns with project goals. If you find a bug, please report it via GitHub issues. The more descriptive you can be, the better. Please include specific steps to reproduce. Bonus points for submitting a PR to fix it! Unified is built primarily via mage. All command examples assume current working directory is the repository root. To build the unified CLI command you would run: Which will build unified as well as any of its dependencies. If successful, it should place the binary at build/unified. Will run any unit tests available. Which are not many at this point. Any reasonable unit test contributions are welcome. If you have a UniFi API host available, you can run integration tests: This will run an integration test that uses ./build/unified to send requests to https://unifi and verify results. Warning While designed to be non-destructive to existing application objects and configuration, some non-GET endpoints are called. Please take a look at existing integration tests and verify you're comfortable running them against your API host. We are not responsible for any harm they might cause to your network device/control-plane. There are facilities to backup your configuration and we strongly suggest you do so before running these tests. Thanks for checking this project out. Hope it helps you in some way.

Title: Elon Musk Brings Starlink to Saudi Arabia as U.S. Oligarchs Join Trump in Middle East

Full Content:
Elon Musk says his satellite internet provider Starlink, a part of SpaceX, has been approved in Saudi Arabia for maritime and aviation use. The billionaire made the announcement while being interviewed at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, a conference where several American oligarchs have joined President Donald Trump to cut deals with the Saudi royal family. Musk “thanked the kingdom for approving Starlink,” referring to the Saudi government, without explaining further, and teased that he’d like to bring his nascent robotaxis to Saudi Arabia. “Yeah, so really you can think of a car or future cars as being robots on four wheels. And you know, I think it would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the kingdom, indeed, if you’re amenable,” Musk said “You heard it here from Elon,” the interviewer said. “He’s bringing his robotaxi to the kingdom.” Musk didn’t offer any specifics and is long known as a bullshitter, so it’s not clear how serious the billionaire is about bringing robotaxis to the Middle East. Tesla plans to launch a trial of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June, but details on that venture are still scarce. Musk also promoted his tunnel-digging venture, The Boring Company, while on stage, explaining that his goal was to “solve traffic” by digging tunnels underground. The billionaire hyped The Boring Company relentlessly during Trump’s first term but has only delivered the most pathetic results. Musk billed his ideas, like the Hyperloop and The Loop, as next-generation, high-speed answers for transportation. In the end, he’s only delivered a slow-moving Tesla driven by a human and hobbled public works projects. But that didn’t stop Musk from insisting that his only functional tunnel ride in Las Vegas, “feels like teleporting for one part of Vegas to another.” Most people do not describe the experience like that. Musk’s America PAC, one of the political arms the billionaire started to help get Trump elected in 2024, shared a video on X that included Musk talking about humanoid robots. Elon Musk's full remarks at the SaudiâU.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh pic.twitter.com/E6orrvgZYA — America (@america) May 13, 2025 “My prediction, actually, for humanoid robots is that ultimately they will be tens of billions,” Musk said, according to CNBC. “I think everyone will want to have their personal robot. You can think of it, like, as though you had your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2. But even better.” President Trump was supposed to be the main attraction at the forum on Tuesday, and his presence in Saudi Arabia was extremely weird, to say the least. Trump opened his speech at the conference with organizers playing Lee Greenwood’s song “God Bless the USA,” as though it was the national anthem or something. Trump stood there in silence for the entirety of the song as the room all stood in silence. The camera periodically cut to Saudi leader Mohammad bin Salman, sometimes known as MBS, and he appeared to be stifling laughter. Trump, who earlier had trouble keeping his eyes open, largely focused on U.S. domestic politics and his personal grievances during the speech, which may not have been exceptional if he had been on American soil. Historically, it’s more normal for U.S. presidents to expand their focus when traveling overseas and not bring up petty matters in an international setting. These aren’t normal times, of course. Several American business leaders were spotted in Riyadh on Tuesday, including Palantir CEO Alex Karp, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even announced his company would be selling 18,000 of its latest AI chips to Saudi Arabia, according to CNBC. But not every tech oligarch was on hand for the forum. In fact, Trump called out Apple’s CEO saying during his speech that, “Tim Cook isn’t here,” apparently upset about that for some reason. “This week there are multi-billion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, they’re all here… Uber, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, and many more,” Trump said. “So I want to congratulate everybody. So many great business executives, many of you… most of you, I know.” Trump went on to say “they weren’t that happy when they saw me,” apparently referring to his election in Nov. 2024, “and now they’re saying, sir, you’re doing a great job, thank you very much. It’s amazing what a rising market will do.” And Trump isn’t altogether wrong. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who criticized the president during his first term, was spotted meeting with both MBS and Trump in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Altman has been rallying behind Trump, as AI boosters believe the Republican president can help inject money into their technology. Trump has held close ties to MBS and the Saudi royal family, even after the leader became an international pariah during Trump’s first term. Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the order of MBS in Istanbul, Turkey, but Trump has always cozied up to the most brutal dictators around the world while denigrating the leaders of liberal democracies. President Trump said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would be buying $600 billion of military equipment. And Trump’s tech buddies, from Musk to Altman, are happy to go along for the ride as long as it helps their bottom line. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: The inflation fight isn't over. Forecasters expect tariffs to show up in prices as soon as next month
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-april-cpi-tariffs-prices-trump-trade-war-economci-outlook-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-13T17:07:49Z
Full Content:
Americans got some relief from inflation last month, but top forecasters say the effects of the trade war aren't yet being reflected in the data, and the coming months could see a fresh spike in prices. The consumer price index cooled unexpectedly in April, with the overall inflation rate dipping to 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.4% in March. But consumers might be navigating another bout of inflation in the coming months. For one, the data is backward-looking and takes time to appear in official statistics. Firms, meanwhile, appeared to stockpile inventory in the first quarter to avoid tariff-related costs. Advanced imports of consumer goods surged as much as nearly 30% during the quarter, Morgan Stanley said. "This number doesn't matter, because the tariff effects are really going to start to show up in next month's number," Ellen Zentner, the chief economist strategist at Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division, told CNBC on Tuesday after the CPI report. Higher numbers in next month's CPI data imply that prices will start to increase for consumers as soon as this month. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said he believed the inflationary impact from tariffs would "escalate" in the summer months. At the moment, there's little evidence to suggest tariffs have affected inflation, besides a slight increase in auto prices, he wrote on Tuesday. John Kerschner, the head of US securitized products and a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, also said he believes inflationary pressures from tariffs could show up starting in June. "Thus, the market will wait with bated breath for those readings to make a determination of where we actually stand on tariff-induced rising prices," he wrote in a note. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel speculated that price increases could come over the next several months. "Again, I don't think we're going to be seeing the effects of this tariff until, you know, maybe June or July. Because so little actually did come into this country and then get priced at the retail level and then sampled by the government officials to get in," Siegel told CNBC prior to the CPI report. Banks have adjusted their forecasts for inflation and economic growth after the US struck a deal with China to lower tariffs for 90 days, but many on Wall Street are still anticipating higher inflation by the end of the year. Goldman Sachs estimated that core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, could rise from 2.6% annually in March to 3.6% by the end of the year. "Our forecast reflects a sharp acceleration in most core goods categories," the bank wrote in a note, adding that it believes tariffs would cause the "most acute" price increases in consumer electronics, autos, and apparel. "There was maybe a hint of tariffs in the data as a few line items with significant imports-household furnishings, medicinal drugs, IT commodities, and toys-saw price increases accelerate this month. But we continue to expect clearer evidence in the months ahead," Bank of America analysts wrote following the CPI release. Economists have warned that tariffs could stoke inflation for Americans, as companies could pass on tariff-related costs to consumers. The average effective US tariff rate will likely end up somewhere around 17%, the Yale Budget Lab estimated this month. That's lower than previous forecasts, but still the highest average tariff rate the US has seen in more than 80 years, Siegel said. Jump to

Title: Capital Markets: New Zealand pushes for renewable investment amid high demand, setbacks

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Genesis Energy's Waipipi wind farm in South Taranaki. Photo / Brett Phibbs, PhibbsVisuals THREE KEY FACTS New Zealand is being promoted as the “smart choice” for investors in renewable electricity, where tens of billions of dollars must be spent in the capital-hungry sector to meet demand and environmental goals. The new push to attract big money came at the New Zealand Infrastructure Investment Summit in March and following the event, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise says it is seeing “significant investor interest” among developers and investors from Japan, Korea, Britain, Germany and from investor migrants through the Active Investor Plus visa programme. As of early May, the renewable energy prospectus released during the summit had been viewed 358 times and downloaded 85 times. The big push for capital comes at a time when there have been high-profile setbacks for large-scale renewable projects and the abrupt exit of the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, after a solar power investment soured. Fast-track consenting processes are now in place but so is a growing queue to have projects considered under new rules. But energy experts at one law firm describe the renewable investment opportunity as “immense” and in a prospectus released by the Government at the summit, the case for it was set out. “With an abundant supply of renewable energy, robust renewable foundations and growing energy demands, New Zealand is the smart choice for your investment.” As New Zealand progresses towards its net-zero aims by decarbonising every sector of the economy, this country’s reliance on electricity is projected to soar, with demand growing by 60% over the next 25 years. To meet this, industries will increasingly rely on our abundant supply of renewable energy. “This presents an enticing proposition, not only to invest in New Zealand’s growing renewable energy and green fuel sectors, but to use our natural resources to your business’s advantage,” the prospectus from Invest NZ says. “Proximity to export markets in Asia and Australia and the country’s strong sustainability goals positioned the renewable energy sector to grow exponentially – benefiting the planet and investors alike.” While in 2023, around 88% of New Zealand’s electricity was generated from renewable sources, there was “huge growth potential” to power industrial processes and transport with clean energy as electrification drives demand. A MinterEllisonRuddWatts report into investing in the renewable energy sector, published last December, says the Government’s domestic target of doubling renewable generation by 2050 will help drive an increase in its electricity supply by close to 70% by 2050 to meet domestic needs, as the New Zealand economy electrifies. In real terms this equates to approximately 400-500 megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity needed every year through to 2050 – a rate of development never seen in this country before. The firm also notes that to support all this new generation, it is estimated at least $22 billion of investment in the distribution network is needed this decade. “Accordingly, the opportunity for investing in renewable energy projects and the associated infrastructure needed is immense, with long-term returns.” Another MinterEllisonRuddWatts report, on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the renewables sector, was published just before the summit and shows high levels of activity. It says as of September last year, there had been more than 160 projects, predominantly wind and solar. Because not all projects in the pipeline will be completed (or complete under current ownership), there remains scope for new entrants, strategic investment and, more relevantly, consolidation or sell-down by existing investors and developers. Independent developers may continue to struggle to secure bankable, offtake arrangements, such as a PPA (power purchase agreement) for a project. It says the New Zealand PPA market is immature and a lack of offtake impacts funding decisions, so some projects may need to be sold. Last year was a busy one for M&A in the renewables sector. MinterEllisonRuddWatts noted that: ● Singapore-based fund management company SC Oscar acquired 100% of utility-scale solar developer Rānui Generation. ● Lodestone announced the acquisition of two grid-level solar sites in Manawatū from Kiwi Solar. ● Genesis Energy secured an advanced stage, 127-megawatt peak (MWp) consented site near Edgecumbe in Bay of Plenty from Helios Energy. ● In September, Contact Energy Ltd entered into a Scheme Implementation Agreement to acquire up to 100% of the shares in generator and wholesaler Manawa Energy Ltd through a scheme of arrangement. The deal values Manawa at $1.86b. ● Genesis took a $64 million, 65% stake in EV charging company ChargeNet NZ Ltd, reflecting Genesis’ ambition to be one of the major players in EV charging networks. ChargeNet has more than 400 fast-charging points nationwide and Genesis’ investment is expected to boost the pace of network development. The Government’s Invest in New Zealand prospectus points to global demand for renewables skyrocketing – and New Zealand is perfectly positioned to meet it, thanks to an abundance of accessible resources generated by hydro, wind, solar and geothermal. Developments in hydrogen and other biofuels also offer significant investment opportunities and excellent export potential. Although big energy users and consumer groups have different views, the Government’s pitch says the country’s energy and electricity markets are mature and open-access. The Electricity Authority monitors the market to ensure fair competition and consumer protection. The Government says it is committed to ensuring businesses have access to secure electricity at internationally competitive prices. At this year’s New Zealand Energy Conference, the Major Energy Users Group warned of the risk of de-industrialisation, with energy-intensive industrial sectors gradually moving their production elsewhere or reducing levels of production here. It said increases in transmission and distribution charges were impacting all consumers and with fewer parties supplying gas, businesses were “having trouble getting long-term gas contracts alongside electricity at reasonable prices”.

BlackRock expects bond ETF assets to more than triple to $6 trillion worldwide within five years. Bond exchange-traded funds have been racking up investment inflows over the last few years and continue to gather steam, thanks in large part to institutional investors, according to BlackRock. The asset management giant forecasted bond ETF assets to more than triple, to $6 trillion worldwide, by the end of the decade. According to a BlackRock report, it took 17 years for bond ETF assets to reach $1 trillion in 2019 and then just another five years for that figure to climb to $1.7 trillion as of the end of September 2024. “The global bond ETF industry is growing faster than expected,” the report stated. “A key driver of this growth has been the adoption of fixed-income ETFs by institutional investors.” According to BlackRock, the 10 largest asset managers—and nine of the 10 largest insurance companies—along with some central banks, are using the investment vehicle. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The report also stated that growing use of actively managed ETFs has contributed to the sharp rise in bond ETF assets. The report found that while bond ETF growth has traditionally been fueled by index-based investments, that source has expanded to now include actively managed ETFs, which provide access to sub-asset classes that are more difficult to index. “Historically, active strategies have only been available in mutual funds or separate accounts,” the report stated. “Today, however, the expanding landscape of active fixed income ETFs enables institutional investors to access these same strategies.” The report cited a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of institutional investors that found that nearly 25% of respondents are considering investing in active ETFs over the next year or two. “Increasingly, active ETFs are becoming critical components in fixed-income portfolios alongside index and enhanced index strategies,” the report stated. “In fact, over the past three years, U.S. actively managed bond ETFs have outpaced the growth of index ETFs at an annualized 26% rate.” According to the BlackRock report, actively managed strategies currently account for 14% of U.S. fixed-income ETF assets under management and 8% of total U.S. ETF assets. “The growth rate of active ETF assets is expected to outpace total ETF growth in coming years, in part driven by the evolving demands from the institutional investor base,” the report stated.

In remarks to business leaders, the president pitched Saudi Arabia as the key to building peace and prosperity in the Middle East, contrasting the kingdom with the nuclear intransigence of Iran. “Exactly eight years ago this month, I stood in this very room and looked forward to a future in which the nations of this region would drive out the forces of terrorism and extremism, and take your place among the proudest, most prosperous, most successful nations of the world—as leaders of a modern and rising Middle East,” Trump said after taking the stage to his signature theme tune, Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless The USA” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known widely as MBS, had promised Trump that the Kingdom would facilitate deals worth $600 billion if the president would make Saudi Arabia his first foreign stop in his second administration — and the two were openly chummy before signing the memorandums at the Royal Court in Riyadh, with Trump joking at one point that they should make the investments worth an even $1 trillion. “Are we doing a good job so far for America? They’re only putting in a trillion dollars,” Trump told reporters while touring the investment forum exhibits before his speech. The $142 billion defense agreement calls for the US to give the Saudis “state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms,” per a White House readout. The deal will focus on air force advancement and space capabilities; air and missile defense; maritime and coastal security; border security and land forces modernization and communication systems upgrades. The US makes “the best military equipment, the best missiles, the best rockets the best everything,” Trump told investors. The president has long touted Saudi arms sales as a boon to American industry, but they have been controversial in the past. In 2019, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed a trio of bills blocking an $8 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, over concern about how they would be used in Yemen’s long-stalemated civil war. The congressional rebuke of Saudi Arabia followed the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which weakened support for Riyadh in Washington after US intelligence agencies assed MBS ordered the operation. Trump vetoed the restrictions, saying at the time that blocking the arms transfers “would hamper the ability of the United States to sustain and shape critical security cooperation activities.” The $600 billion investment commitment includes letters of understanding for future cooperation on energy, future defense capabilities, mineral resources, and space and infectious diseases. As part of the agreement, Saudi-based DataVolt, will invest $20 billion towards US AI centers; while Google, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD, and Uber have pledged $80 billion in technology across both countries. Meanwhile, US companies Hill International, Jacobs, Parsons, and AECOM are taking on infrastructure projects inside Saudi Arabia worth a total of $2 billion, including the expansion of Riyadh’s King Salman International Airport. GE Vernova will also send out gas turbines and “energy solutions” worth $14.2 billion, while Boeing will sell 737-8 passenger aircraft to Saudi jet rental service AviLease for a cool $4.8 billion. Additionally, kingdom-based Shamekh IV Solutions has agreed to invest $5.8 billion to construct a facility in Michigan. “It is crucial for the wider world to note, this great transformation has not come from Western interventionists flying in with lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs,” Trump said. “The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons, or liberal non-profits like those who spent trillions failing to develop Kabul and Baghdad. “Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought about by the people of the region themselves, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions, and charting your own destinies in your own way.” Turning to Iran, Trump said he did not want “merely to condemn the past choices of Iran’s leaders, but to offer them a new and a better path toward a much more hopeful future.” The investment conference was packed with business leaders lobbying for more economic partnerships between the US and Saudi Arabia, which has targeted increased diversification as part of its Saudi Vision 2030 initiative. The projects include New Murabba, a climate controlled indoor city that is said to be the world’s largest downtown project — and will include a cube skyscraper when completed at the turn of the next decade. Trump aide Elon Musk made a surprise appearance on stage at the forum, revealing he spoke with Trump and Saudi royal family about building “tens of millions” of “humanoid robots” that he hopes will be a part of our everyday lives soon. He also spoke to the leaders about autonomous cars and how his technology would be relevant to Saudi Arabia’s future economic vision. The Post spotted Palantir CEO Alex Karp walking around the conference center after speaking with the two leaders at the Royal Court. Other business leaders who had access to Trump and MBS on Tuesday included BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, Google CIO Ruth Porat, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey. LinkedIn executive chairman Reid Hoffman was also listed as attending a lunch attended by Trump and nearly two dozen Saudi royals, but retweeted a photo Tuesday afternoon confirming he was not in Riyadh.

Donald Trump’s first visit to Saudi Arabia as president for the second time came with some standard fare, like an unbelievably massive arms deal he signed on Tuesday. Less orthodox is the lunch scheduled for today, which featured leading executives in American business and finance as well as a few random hangers-on. The lunch was part of a summit in which Saudi leaders agreed to a purported investment of $600 billion in American companies, mostly working in tech, artificial intelligence, and, of course, defense contractors. (Of the $600 billion sum, $142 billion will go to American defense firms selling missile systems, training, and the like.) To prepare for the glut of oil money coming their way, the president invited many leaders like Sam Altman of OpenAI; Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir; Jeff Miller, the CEO of Halliburton; Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia; and Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon. Most of the names on the list make sense. If you’re looking at boosting Saudi investment in U.S., you probably want BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman there. If you’re looking at further investment in American AI, Altman, Huang, and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna are going to be munching apps, too. Obviously, Elon Musk is going to be there. But there are a few standouts. Why the mayor of Miami in Riyadh? What are the CEOs of Coca-Cola or Epic Games doing there? And what about Travis Kalanick, the former bad boss of Uber? The answer is kind of obvious: Saudi money and/or Trump fealty. For example, Kalanick’s latest venture is a ghost-kitchen company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — which is reportedly considering an initial public offering in the Middle East. Or take Miami mayor Francis Suarez, a staunch cryptocurrency booster who has backed the president’s pro-crypto industry policies. Despite leading the 42nd-largest U.S. city, he ended up with a ticket. Beyond securing the $600 billion promise, Trump, for one, did not seem especially focused at the meeting, commenting on Apple CEO Tim Cook’s absence and bragging about winning “all seven swing states.” But the real question remains this: Why isn’t the McDonald’s CEO there?

May 13, 2025 12:24 ET | Source: Gainey McKenna & Egleston Gainey McKenna & Egleston NEW YORK, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gainey McKenna & Egleston announces that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) securities between April 18, 2024 and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the Company’s investors under the federal securities laws. According to the Complaint, throughout the Class Period, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. The Complaint alleges that while Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The Complaint further alleges that Defendants maintained they had “visibility into 75% of our Medicaid rates and premiums for 2024” and that “[t]he vast majority of those are in line with our expectations and they’re actuarially sound.” The Complaint also alleges that Defendants further reassured investors that “we’re intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook,” and that, while the Company was seeing an acuity mix shift in the Medicaid business, it was “nothing outside of the bounds of what we’ve expected and guided for.” The Complaint alleges that these representations were materially false or misleading. The Complaint alleges that in truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. The Complaint further alleges that this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. According to the Complaint, the truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” The Complaint alleges that in response to these disclosures, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, from a closing price of $553.14 on July 16, 2024, to a closing price of $520.93 on July 17, 2024. Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of Elevance should contact the Firm prior to the July 11, 2025 lead plaintiff motion deadline. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April. Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing “unnecessary layers” in its organization. Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes that led to lower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn’t tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections. “How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?” Nadella said. “At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don’t keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.” On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July. Jordan Novet is a CNBC technology reporter specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Microsoft. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Wall Street Gutted Steward Health Care. Patients Paid the Price.

Dadu Shin Hannah Levintova, with data analysis by Melissa LewisMay 13, 2025 Sungida Rashid had no intention of taking an Uber to the birth of her first child. She’d never been one to take the easy route, and besides, she wanted to get things moving—and walking seemed the best way to do it. So on an overcast Sunday in October 2023, Sungida and her husband, Nabil Haque, set out from their Boston apartment to St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center, the local hospital where ­Sungida, nine months pregnant, was scheduled to be induced. Sungida and Nabil had met 12 years earlier while working at a consulting firm in their native Bangladesh. Over lunches, they began strategizing about PhD applications, eventually spending years in a long-distance relationship as they fell in love and pursued their doctoral degrees in the United States. Then there was a tiny pandemic wedding, a move to Bangkok for work (she was an economics professor, he a climate researcher), a heartbreaking miscarriage, the cautious joy of another pregnancy, and finally, when Sungida was seven months along, a job opportunity for Nabil at Boston University. Sungida had waved off her husband’s suggestion that they delay his start date so she could stick with her doctors in ­Bangkok. She’d long dreamed of teaching at an American university, and the pandemic had upended several job prospects. Living in Boston would give her the chance to pursue a professorship again and, more importantly, to raise their little girl far from Bangladesh, in a country that offered greater opportunities, cleaner air, and better medical care. In their first days in Boston, Nabil set up appointments at two prospective hospitals: Brigham and Women’s, a world-­renowned nonprofit medical center, and St. Elizabeth’s, a humbler facility owned by a national for-profit hospital chain called Steward Health Care. The appointment at St. Elizabeth’s came first, and Sungida liked the midwife, so they canceled the other appointment. A few weeks later, they walked in and got ready for her induction. Her labor moved slowly, but at around 1 a.m. on October 17, Sungida gave birth to a healthy baby girl. She and Nabil named her Otindria—Bangladeshi for “extra sensory”—and snapped a smiling selfie as a new family of three, Otindria snuggled in a hospital swaddle. In the hours after, Sungida experienced some excess bleeding that doctors resolved, and soon she and Nabil moved to the recovery floor. With Otindria in her bassinet and Sungida in bed, Nabil coordinated video calls with family. He kept trying, and failing, to swaddle the baby in her ­blanket—he and Sungida laughed at how easy the nurses made it look. She reassured him they would get the hang of it. In the afternoon, Nabil made a quick trip back to their apartment. When he returned, he told Sungida he already missed his newborn daughter. “Oh, you don’t miss me now?” she joked. She was having some back pain, and nurses brought in ice packs and heating pads for relief. But as the couple settled in to watch The ­Avengers—Sungida was a huge Marvel fan—her pain worsened. After about 10 minutes, staff came in to check her vitals. Her blood pressure had dropped dangerously low. Alarms began to sound: “Code red on the recovery floor!” a voice blared over the loudspeaker. What felt to Nabil like 20 people rushed into their room. They wheeled Sungida out and took Otindria to the nursery. Nabil sat in the recovery room alone—no bed, no baby. Every so often, someone came by with an update. A CT scan showed Sungida’s abdomen had filled with blood; she needed surgery. In the OR, doctors discovered the bleed was coming from her liver. They told Nabil they would insert an embolism coil—a small device that can be placed in blood vessels to stem internal bleeding. About half an hour later, hospital staff informed Nabil they needed to transfer his wife to Boston Medical Center, 20 minutes away, because it was better equipped to do the procedure, they said. What no one told him was that St. Elizabeth’s supply of embolism coils had been repossessed by the vendor a month earlier. According to a complaint later filed with the state health department, the hospital owed more than $500,000 for these devices; the vendor claimed in a lawsuit that, nationally, Steward facilities owed it nearly $5 million. A group of St. Elizabeth’s nurses had confronted Steward management about this at a tense union meeting three weeks prior: What if a patient needed a coil? The irritated chief nursing officer responded that the hospital simply wouldn’t accept transfer patients with internal bleeding. But what if something happened in-house? The CNO didn’t answer the question. Now that exact scenario was unfolding, and staff had little choice but to transfer a woman in the midst of surgery. A nurse whisked Nabil upstairs to watch as Sungida, lying on a stretcher, her face pale, tubes up her nose, was wheeled down a hallway and out to a waiting ambulance. It would be the last time he saw her alive. St. Elizabeth’s was just a sliver of Steward’s empire. At its peak, the company boasted 41 hospitals in 10 states, medical facilities in four foreign countries, and roughly $8 billion in annual revenue. It distinguished itself to investors by promising a way to tackle a thorny problem for the industry: how to run hospitals in low-income communities while still turning a profit. Industry dominance was always the dream of Steward’s CEO, Ralph de la Torre. When he took the helm of a struggling Massachusetts-based Catholic hospital chain called Caritas Christi in 2008, de la Torre—a child of Cuban immigrants and famously ambitious cardiac surgeon—was so sure of succeeding that he let his medical license expire. Two years later, he convinced the powerful private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management to buy ­Caritas, which it renamed Steward. His timing was perfect: Private equity firms, which focus on generating a big, quick payday for their investors, had just begun ramping up their positions in health care. De la Torre hoped that teaming up with Wall Street would catapult him to national prominence, kicking off what the Boston Globe called “a royal conquest.” His reign came to an end when Steward filed for bankruptcy in May 2024, a spectacular downfall helped along by Cerberus and Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a mysterious Alabama-based real estate investment trust that became heavily involved in the company over the last decade. Steward has since been the subject of news reports and Senate hearings trying to grasp the astonishing scale of its unpaid bills—$9 billion owed to more than 100,000 creditors—and the extent to which patients suffered as executives enriched themselves. De la Torre, for instance, bought himself a $40 million yacht and an $8 million apartment in Madrid, made hundreds of trips on Steward’s private plane, and gave $10 million to his children’s elite prep school in Dallas, a donation financed partially from Steward’s coffers, according to leaked documents obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Cerberus made $800 million, more than tripling its investment. The CEO of MPT earned nearly $18 million last year, making him the highest-paid executive in Alabama. (De la Torre did not respond to a request for comment. Cerberus and MPT declined to answer questions from Mother Jones. In public documents, both companies have denied that their actions contributed to Steward’s financial distress.) It was Sungida’s death that first connected this excess to its human costs. A January 2024 Globe story lit a fire under Massachusetts officials and regulators, who expressed outrage that profit motive had trumped patient care in a city that prides itself on world-class hospitals. Sen. Ed Markey convened a hearing that opened with a reference to Sungida, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who for years has fought to rein in Wall Street, warned that Steward was no outlier. “I will say it bluntly,” she said. “Turning private equity loose in our health care system kills people.” I’ve heard this repeatedly while writing about private equity over the last five years. One study found that private equity–owned nursing homes had a mortality rate 10 percent higher than their non-PE counterparts; another noted that patients at PE-owned hospitals are 25 percent more likely to suffer an unrelated injury while admitted, whether a fall or an infection. But such studies only provide a glimpse of the problem. As savvy executives squeeze returns out of facilities that determine whether patients live or die, there is no systematic data tracking how their acquisitions affect care. Before its downfall, Steward was among private equity’s biggest health care conquests. I wanted to know how many more Sungidas were out there. “The reason that there are more cases with Steward is not because they have worse doctors. It’s that they didn’t give the doctors and nurses and all the staff the resources they need to do their job the right way.” Over the course of our yearlong investigation, Mother Jones reviewed every malpractice, personal injury, and wrongful death case filed in state and federal courts involving Steward hospitals. We found 469 lawsuits involving 83 patient deaths; many have settled or have been thwarted by Steward’s bankruptcy, while some were dismissed or resolved in the company’s favor. These numbers may understate the extent of the problem, given that the company’s hospitals served primarily low-income communities, where most patients and their families lack the resources to mount a case. We also combed through Steward’s federal inspection reports, finding 708 “deficiencies” in patient care, including 35 classified as “immediate jeopardy”—situations that led or could lead to serious harm or injury. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the degree to which Steward’s business choices contributed to poor treatment, academic research has shown that systemic issues, not individual errors, typically lie at the root of malpractice. Steward’s bankruptcy paused many of the malpractice suits, making it difficult or impossible for attorneys to depose medical staff or obtain company records—information that could link their allegations of malpractice to cost-cutting decisions. But what is clear, experts say, is that a pattern of substandard care arose as Steward and its partners prioritized their bottom lines. (Steward declined to answer detailed questions from Mother Jones.) “Steward made a decision somewhere along the line that in order to keep making the money they wanted to make, there were going to have to be cuts,” says Rob Higgins, a partner at the Boston malpractice firm Lubin & Meyer who has litigated dozens of cases against Steward hospitals. “The reason that there are more cases with Steward is not because they have worse doctors. It’s that they didn’t give the doctors and nurses and all the staff the resources they need to do their job the right way.” Our reporting builds on the work of other journalists and legislators who have investigated Steward’s activities. The Globe’s Spotlight team found at least 15 patients who died at Steward facilities after receiving subpar care. A Senate report from September found that heart-failure death rates at some hospitals increased by up to 40 percent on Steward’s watch, even as the national average declined. Wait times in Steward ERs were also far above the national average. Our investigation also dug up allegations of sexual assault by medical staff, lawsuits by whistleblowers who alleged they were fired for calling out Steward management, and a troubling pattern of problems in labor and delivery: We found 12 additional instances of moms and newborns who died at Steward hospitals over the last 14 years, and 21 more who suffered severe injuries. From skipped ultrasounds to inexplicable delays in emergency care, the court filings recount gutting details. One Florida woman lost her baby after waiting almost three hours for someone to perform a C-section, despite a placental abruption, excessive bleeding, and dramatic drops in the fetal heart rate; it was her ninth pregnancy and the first she’d carried to term after years of IVF. At another Steward hospital in Florida, doctors wanted to prescribe a steroid drug to treat a woman’s postpartum blood disorder, but no administrators were reachable over Labor Day weekend to approve the order, and she died. At St. Elizabeth’s, where Sungida went, another patient bled so much after giving birth that she suffered a stroke and needed brain surgery—in part because an ultrasound to assess the hemorrhage was done too late. At a Steward facility in Texas, a baby was born with severe brain injuries after staff waited almost a day to perform a C-section, despite clear signs of fetal distress. There are more cases like these: 49 of Steward’s federal deficiency reports involve maternal care. The labor and delivery problems at ­Steward hospitals are consistent with an industry cost-cutting trend: When private equity firms and other financiers buy hospitals, they tend to target obstetrics units. “There is a mismatch between how much obstetrics costs and how much revenue it generates,” explains Katy Kozhimannil, a health policy professor at the University of Minnesota who studies maternal unit closures. Insurance reimbursement rates for maternal services are notoriously low, and the costs of running a fully staffed unit—with specialized doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists, and birthing equipment—can quickly outpace returns. As the allegations of deadly neglect swirl around Steward, its investors, executives, and partners have faced little accountability. Many hospitals eat the loss, Kozhimannil says, because maternity services fulfill a community need and align with their public mission. But investor-owned hospitals, unwilling to make that trade-off, have been closing maternity wards for years. Ascension, a Catholic hospital chain that partnered with the private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, has closed more than a quarter of the labor and delivery units at its 140-plus hospitals over the last decade. Prospect Medical Holdings shuttered one of the few obstetrics units in its 16-hospital system after it was taken over by the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners. Steward closed at least six labor units and two neonatal units, as well as three hospitals that provided obstetric services—eliminating a third of the labor units in its portfolio. As the allegations of deadly neglect swirl around Steward, its investors, executives, and partners have faced little accountability. Senators held de la Torre in criminal contempt after he refused to testify at a hearing in September, yet officials from Cerberus and MPT, the real estate investment trust, weren’t even summoned, despite their involvement in Steward’s unraveling. A number of financial analysts have published evidence showing how MPT, which still owns the real estate of dozens of Steward hospitals, used those properties in its own enrichment scheme. MPT has gone to extremes to quash the findings, paying millions of dollars to private intelligence firms to target Steward’s critics, filing a defamation lawsuit, and subpoenaing those who dare speak to the press. The broader Steward saga is stunning in its complexity, brazenness, and scale, laying bare the extent to which profit-­seeking and patient care are incompatible, and the lengths to which corporate titans have gone to hide that reality. “All of a sudden, somewhere, there’s a switch that turns that says, maybe we can make a boatload of money,” Higgins says. “They were living a lifestyle of NBA basketball players that have hundreds of millions of dollars. And it’s scary to think that for a long period of time, they were running these hospitals the way they were.” Nabil got to Boston Medical around midnight. He was ushered into an empty waiting room and told to make himself comfortable: His wife’s surgery would be long. He called his parents and made plans for them to fly to Boston to help during what surely would be a difficult recovery. Barely an hour later, a surgeon appeared. They had tried everything, but the bleeding was too severe. There was just too much damage to her liver. Sungida was dead. “How?” Nabil asked in disbelief. “We don’t know,” the doctor said. He told Nabil he could request an autopsy. “I will say it bluntly. Turning private equity loose in our health care system kills people.” Nabil sat in the waiting room, stunned. Just hours ago, he and Sungida had been talking about watching a movie together. Now he was texting relatives with the unspeakable news. He was eventually led through a maze of hallways and into a basement room where a staffer pulled back a curtain and revealed his wife’s body, covered with a sheet. “It was so scary seeing her lifeless,” he says. “I couldn’t stand there for more than five minutes.” Someone called him an Uber. When he got back to his apartment at 4 a.m., Nabil saw Sungida everywhere: in her beloved saris and half-used perfume bottles and the suitcase of pre-pregnancy clothes she hadn’t yet unpacked because none of them fit. He opened the fridge to find the food she’d prepared for their first days as a family of three. “I was still in shock,” he recalls. “I didn’t know what to do.” His mind turned to his daughter, and to their unfathomable future: “She was so tiny and so fragile—how is she going to survive this?” When Nabil called the nursery to check on Otindria, the nurses said she was doing fine. They asked after Sungida—they hadn’t yet heard. After the call ended, the nurses texted him photos of the baby. He couldn’t believe how much she already looked like her mother. For the rest of his life, he realized, it would be his job to convince ­Otindria that what happened wasn’t her fault. He climbed into the shower and, for the first time, allowed himself to cry. Later, he sat down and wrote a Facebook post: “Yesterday, I welcomed my daughter to this world,” it began. “Today, I am in grief losing the mother of my daughter due to unexplained medical circumstances.” He asked their friends to reminisce about Sungida and to refrain from asking medical questions. Her doctors were “bewildered,” he wrote. After a few hours of sleep, he headed back to St. Elizabeth’s to check on Otindria and attend a briefing with hospital staff. It was held just a few doors down from the recovery room where Sungida had so recently been alive, alert, and cracking jokes. Doctors and administrators crowded into the cramped room. As Nabil held his newborn, they told him that this was a freak event. They hypothesized that the hormonal roller coaster of labor and birth had caused a blood vessel in Sungida’s liver to burst. Maybe, they said, something about her liver was anatomically different. There was no mention of the repossessed coils, of the tense union meeting, or of the management’s failure to plan for this very scenario. Nabil remembers them saying repeatedly that his wife’s death was improbable and random: “They said, ‘You can think of it like your wife got hit by lightning.’” He had only one question, the one gnawing at him since the night before. Would Otindria blame herself? One of the doctors answered immediately: If she ever does, he should tell her it was the hospital’s fault. Steward’s rise and fall is a telling example of how the private equity playbook has infiltrated American life. Over the last two decades, PE firms, which invest money on behalf of wealthy clients and major investors like pension funds, have been buying up everything from family homes and apartment buildings to day cares and medical practices and transforming them into bundles of assets to be engineered for profit. They charge investors hefty management fees and, in exchange, promise market-beating returns in just a few years. To do that, they focus on cutting costs—scrimping on wages, benefits, and materials—to extract maximal returns. When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, he unwittingly opened up a fresh prospect for private equity. The droves of newly insured Americans, the industry suspected, would mean a big revenue boost for hospitals. Community hospitals presented a particularly attractive option because Medicaid expansion meant more patients at higher reimbursement rates, and the government would likely bail out facilities that failed. Soon private equity firms were snapping up hospitals like never before. That same year, Cerberus—named for the three-headed dog who guards Hades in Greek mythology—bought six hospitals from de la Torre’s small Catholic hospital chain, Caritas, for $895 million. It put up one-third of the total in cash, and, as is common in private equity deals, financed the rest with loans loaded onto Steward’s balance sheet. Turning a nonprofit into a for-profit required approval from Massachusetts’ attorney general, which she granted on condition that Cerberus invest $400 million in hospital upgrades. Cerberus complied, but covered the cost by saddling Steward with even more debt—loans that Cerberus and its investors would not be responsible for repaying. De la Torre, now Steward’s CEO, introduced himself soon after to the staff of one of the newly acquired hospitals. To a packed auditorium, he recalled learning to scuba dive as a kid and how he’d been taught you should always go with a partner. If you encounter a shark, he joked, you grab your diving knife, stab your partner, and swim away. “He was expecting a big laugh,” one staffer who attended the speech recalls. “But what he got was gasps.” Cerberus rapidly acquired five more ­Massachusetts hospitals, adding more debt to Steward’s ledger. By 2012, Steward was a $1.9 billion company with 17,000 employees, and it wasn’t long before executives’ cost-cutting efforts began drawing their ire. After the company eliminated more than 100 nursing jobs in two years, the nurses union filed more than 1,000 complaints with the state health department alleging unsafe staffing. Although Steward’s hospital portfolio was then limited to roughly a dozen facilities, it soon closed one of them and shut down pediatrics at another. It also began selling some of its buildings and renting them back. These “sale-leasebacks” ­provided a cash infusion to offset Steward’s growing debt load, which would triple during Cerberus’ first four years of ownership. In mid-2015, de la Torre flew to Alabama to meet with Edward Aldag, the unofficial king of health care sale-leasebacks. A dozen years earlier, Aldag had founded Medical Properties Trust, a one-of-a-kind real estate investment trust (REIT) that focused exclusively on doing such deals with hospitals. The men decided on the spot to work together: MPT’s annual report described them bonding over their “similar philosophies” about the future of health care. All involved had something to gain: ­Cerberus and de la Torre wanted to expand Steward, and an MPT deal would give them the cash to do it. MPT said in its annual report that it would collect rent from Steward hospitals and would have the option to buy any new facilities Steward acquired—to transform them, too, into lucrative tenants. “It’s just this long line of rinse and repeat of basically looting safety-net hospital systems.” By 2016, MPT had bought Steward’s nine remaining Massachusetts hospitals for $1.25 billion and leased them back at exorbitant rents. If the aim was to provide quality care, one of de la Torre’s colleagues told the Globe, this made no sense: “We all sort of nodded our heads and rolled our eyes and said, ‘Oh, now I get it. There are no plans to turn this into a viable set of community hospitals. It’s all about pulling money.’” Cerberus used proceeds from the sale to pay itself more than $700 million—a $473 million return on investment. De la Torre received a $71 million dividend. Over the next three years, Cerberus used the remaining funds to finance the purchase of 26 more hospitals in nine states, piling even more debt on Steward, whose facilities continued to face cuts. Patient care fiascoes were starting to escalate. At Good Samaritan Medical Center in 2018, a baby died when her mother’s uterus burst, according to legal filings—overworked staff had ignored her history of placental abruption. In fact, in the years after MPT first got involved, at least 20 patients died at Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals from alleged malpractice; 50 more died at its other facilities across the country during that time, according to the complaints we found. (Some of these cases were dismissed or settled; others remain open due to Steward’s bankruptcy.) In a region full of Harvard-affiliated doctors and hospitals known for being among the nation’s best, Steward’s raw Wall Street calculus was so foreign that it went virtually undetected, says Dr. Paul Hattis, a senior fellow at the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, who has served on the state’s Health Policy Commission. “I don’t think the regulatory apparatus was used to dealing with actors fueled by that kind of greed,” he says. “The money was going into the organization and then out the back door into the dividend pocket of an owner, but then neglecting patient care in the middle. That just was not something that we were used to thinking about having to protect against—the bleeding of an asset. So, you say, ‘Why didn’t regulators do more?’ I think they didn’t fully grasp what was going on until it was too late.” After Sungida’s death, Nabil’s parents, brother, and sister-in-law flew in to help. They shared his small bedroom while Nabil slept on the chaise in the living room, ­Otindria in her bassinet beside him. Every day delivered another gut punch. On Sungida’s phone, Nabil discovered a note she had written to introduce her baby to the world. He opened her inbox to find an interview offer for an economics professorship at Central Michigan University. “Seeing that email, I was like, You got everything you wanted,” he recalls. “It broke my heart.” About a month later, he got an email from a reporter at the Globe. Nurses at St. Elizabeth’s and their union had filed a complaint with the state department of health over the repossession of the embolism coils and what had happened to Sungida. He sat in his office at Boston University, unsure of what to think. He felt lost, even skeptical, but also distraught. Could this coil have saved her? Then he got a bill for the cost of her medevac to Boston Medical. Given what Nabil now knew about the coil, he wondered whether he was being asked to pay $1,076 for transport that should never have been necessary. His anger intensified when he received Sungida’s autopsy report from ­Boston Medical. It said she’d had placenta accreta, a condition that usually needs to be resolved by removing the uterus after birth. If true, that meant St. Elizabeth’s had missed it—yet another glaring shortfall, he thought, in Sungida’s care. He emailed the hospital’s chief medical officer, who in a subsequent briefing disputed the autopsy findings, insisting that there was no placenta accreta—and that her liver was the only problem. Sometimes, at night, he would hold Otindria close and whisper into the darkness: “Your childhood would be so different if it was the other parent.” Back home with Otindria, Nabil settled into a routine he repeated every three hours: feeding, fresh diaper, back to sleep. Scrolling Netflix one night, he came across the movie Fatherhood, which follows a dad (Kevin Hart) whose wife dies in a Boston hospital after giving birth to their daughter. The parallels felt uncanny. Hart’s character wrestles with whether to move home to the Midwest, where his mother can help care for the baby. Nabil faced the same dilemma. Sungida’s greatest hope had been for her girl to grow into an independent woman in a place where she would face fewer limits. But he was overwhelmed by the thought of caring for Otindria alone. He decided to go back to Dhaka. As he planned the move, Nabil thought often about how Sungida would have handled the situation so much better. She would have figured out a way to keep Otindria in America and put up a stronger fight to find out what had happened at the hospital. Sometimes, at night, he would hold Otindria close and whisper into the darkness: “Your childhood would be so different if it was the other parent.” If she had to lose a parent, he thought to himself, it should have been him. In the years before Sungida’s death, MPT acquired one Steward hospital after another, binding each facility to a high-rent lease. Steward began to cut costs even more aggressively. In 2017, it closed the maternity ward at a hospital in southeastern Massachusetts. The next year, it shut down Northside Regional Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, which housed the city’s only labor and delivery unit. In 2019, it closed its hospital in Phoenix and a neonatal unit in Easton, Pennsylvania. When the pandemic hit, it threatened to shutter the Easton facility altogether, demanding $40 million from the state to stay open—the governor granted $8 million. Steward took the money, closed the obstetrics unit, and sold the hospital three months later for $15 million. Steward’s other hospitals deteriorated, according to government proceedings. Janitors at its Haverhill, Massachusetts, facility were buying toilet paper for patients with their own money. At St. Elizabeth’s, nurses purchased specialized bereavement boxes for stillborn babies after the hospital ran out. In West Monroe, Louisiana, a nurse practitioner discovered that Steward had stopped paying its on-call cardiologist as the doctor was caring for a patient in the middle of a heart attack. The company seemed to be bleeding money: It reported losses of $207 million in 2017 and $271 million in 2018. During the pandemic, Steward claimed its largest loss ever—$408 million—despite record levels of government assistance. The company also faced a criminal inquiry in Malta, tied to a $4.35 billion contract it had won to operate three government hospitals in the island nation. Millions in taxpayer funds earmarked for improving the facilities seemed to disappear; Maltese officials sued Steward, accusing it of using the money for bribes and kickbacks and to “unjustly enrich itself.” (Their investigation is ongoing.) In some years, Steward hospitals made up more than a third of MPT’s assets and almost half of its revenue. If Steward died, it could take MPT with it. By the end of 2019, Cerberus executives began expressing concern to investors. Then, in May 2020, they engineered a complex transaction that transferred the firm’s $350 million stake in Steward to de la Torre and other Steward leaders as a loan, giving them five years to pay it back. Experts wondered whether this hinted at an impending collapse: In bankruptcy proceedings, lenders tend to get paid whereas stockholders don’t. (Cerberus has denied that this was its motivation.) MPT, too, was thinking about how to protect its bottom line. For the real estate trust, Steward’s survival was existential. In some years, its hospitals made up more than a third of MPT’s assets and almost half of its revenue. If Steward died, it could take MPT with it. Its solution was a top-secret plan executives dubbed “Project Easter,” according to internal documents obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Publicly, MPT expressed optimism. In an early 2021 earnings call, CEO Aldag bragged that the company “has the strongest portfolio of hospitals in the world.” But privately, according to the OCCRP’s documents, MPT executives knew Steward was desperate for cash, so they devised a scheme that would keep it afloat while enriching executives of all three companies. In the summer of 2020, MPT purchased several Steward properties, pouring $400 million into the company. Six months later, it loaned Steward $335 million to help buy out Cerberus’ stake, bringing the private equity firm’s total profit from its ownership of Steward to $800 million. That same month, Steward paid its investors $111 million, which included about $83 million for de la Torre; MPT, which owned almost 10 percent of Steward, pocketed a cool $11 million. When MPT disclosed the deal in federal filings four months later, the financial press took notice. Not only was the deal “unusual,” per Bloomberg, but it revealed a growing private equity pattern, wherein a sort of Russian nesting doll of financiers work together to make money off struggling hospitals. After the Wall Street Journal and others wrote about the deal, Rob Simone, an investment analyst in suburban Connecticut, began seeing a surge of interest. Simone, 40, was a REIT specialist at Hedgeye, a research firm that does deep dives on stocks and sells them to portfolio managers. Suddenly, client after client was inquiring about MPT, which is publicly traded. Poring over the firm’s financial filings, Simone began to suspect that MPT was propping up Steward well beyond the Cerberus deal, an arrangement he called “a perverse marriage” when we spoke last year. He started publishing research to this effect, and laying out the details on Hedgeye’s YouTube channel in his crisp, fast-talking style. MPT had announced, for example, that it was investing $169 million in a new Steward facility in Texas. A bit of Googling revealed that the project was slated for Texarkana, a small city on the state’s eastern edge. This piqued Simone’s interest: Texarkana’s population was shrinking, and it already had a perfectly good hospital. Developing a pricey new one made no sense. By now, Simone knew MPT’s “special sauce” was buying up struggling safety-net hospitals, which are particularly vulnerable to the devil’s bargain of sale-leasebacks. Indeed, MPT’s high rents have cratered hospital systems in multiple states. Facilities can’t keep up, and they inevitably slash services or close down. Pipeline Health, for instance, declared bankruptcy in 2022, about a year after MPT bought its Los Angeles hospitals. A profitable community hospital in Watsonville, California, closed two years after MPT purchased it. “It’s just this long line of rinse and repeat of basically looting safety-net hospital systems,” Simone says. It occurred to Simone: What if all this new investment was just a way of funneling cash back into MPT’s trail of failing hospitals? MPT’s compensation scheme was also quite unusual for a REIT: Executive pay was tied to the dollar value of its acquisitions. The more hospitals MPT bought, and the more it paid for them, the more money the executives brought home. “You don’t just get compensated for paying the highest price, but also to go out and buy anything,” Simone says. “I knew right away when I saw that, this was going to be a bad outcome.” After each hospital system faltered, MPT would buy a new one and issue a flurry of press releases. It occurred to Simone: What if all this new investment was just a way of funneling cash back into MPT’s trail of failing hospitals? Wasn’t this similar to a Ponzi scheme, in that MPT brought on new tenants who could afford to pay the rent to help prop up the older ones who couldn’t? (In a letter to senators, MPT denied the allegation that it is a Ponzi scheme.) Simone hired a photographer to check out the Texarkana project. Financial statements said MPT and Steward were more than $50 million into the build, but the photographer sent back shots of an empty field. In one, a portable toilet lay toppled over. “$50 million was literally tumbleweeds,” Simone says. The photos further fueled his hunch that MPT was covering up Steward’s money problems by providing it cash that would come back to MPT as rent—payments MPT could then record as earnings to maintain a facade of business success. (In 2023, MPT commissioned an investigation that found no evidence of this.) Simone published his Texarkana findings, affirming his earlier recommendation that his firm’s clients should short MPT—bet on the future decline of its stock. Soon after, he received anonymous death threats. Trolls on X went after him incessantly, even posting his home address and the country club to which he belongs. But Simone’s reports motivated other analysts and short sellers to look into MPT. The most prominent was Viceroy Research, which had played a key role in exposing one of Europe’s greatest recent frauds—that of payment processor Wirecard, whose top executives now face criminal charges. In 2023, Viceroy expanded on Simone’s findings, claiming that one of the ways MPT seemed to funnel money to Steward was by dramatically overvaluing its hospitals, according to legal filings. Viceroy calculated that MPT may have overpaid Steward by at least $1 billion for its real estate. For example, it loaned Steward $1.4 billion to buy a chain of 19 hospitals, but soon ­forgave $700 million of the loan. In another case, Steward bought a Texas hospital for $11.7 million and sold it to MPT the same day for $26 million. (MPT sued Viceroy and claimed its underwriting process for determining hospital values is accurate. The case was settled in December.) There were other projects that seemed off. In 2021, Steward announced plans to build a state-of-the-art hospital in Utah, on a parcel of “trust land”—federally owned land bestowed to states to use for public benefit. To this day, the site remains an empty, overgrown field, yet another expensive project that may have existed only on paper. In 2022, Steward spent $60 million on a shuttered Miami hospital that it never reopened. (MPT did not respond to questions about its involvement in these hospital purchases.) But no amount of financial contortion could stop Steward’s downward spiral. As the hospital closures continued, dozens of lawsuits from staff and stiffed vendors piled up, and the federal government sued the company, alleging Medicare fraud. In September 2023, a sales rep marched into St. Elizabeth’s to repossess the embolism coils that, three weeks later, might have saved Sungida’s life. “I don’t think the regulatory apparatus was used to dealing with actors fueled by that kind of greed.” Simone is a finance guy, and his research is aimed at helping investors. But as a father of three, he never lost sight of the likely human toll of MPT’s accounting tricks. Without MPT propping it up, he says, “Steward would have become a bankruptcy years ago.” About five years, he figures—five fewer years of “patients dying, hospitals closing, vendors not getting paid…everything would have been pulled forward in time and ended.” In late January 2024, Nabil flew with ­Otindria to Bangladesh. Days later, the Globe published its story about ­Sungida’s death. It sparked a national reckoning. That’s “what finally blew the lid off all this,” a St. Elizabeth’s nurse told lawmakers at a subsequent Senate hearing. That spring, Steward’s bankruptcy proceedings revealed more details about its looting of patient care: It owed nearly $300 million in unpaid wages, including more than $105 million to doctors and $42 million to a single nurse staffing agency. It owed almost $1 billion to various vendors, including $79 million to suppliers of care items ranging from sterilization equipment to newborn test kits. Two Senate committees launched investigations into Steward and the broader trend of private equity in health care. Several states commenced their own accountability efforts—a blistering hearing in Louisiana, an investigation in Arizona, and a new law in Massachusetts that subjects private equity hospital owners to extra scrutiny and prevents them from selling hospital real estate to entities like MPT. Sen. Markey introduced a federal bill, though it has yet to move out of committee, that would regulate PE health care purchases. As Steward fell apart, so did Nabil’s vision of his future. He and Sungida had relished the idea of parenting on their own—the “American struggle,” they’d called it. Now he was back with his parents, who spent hours each day caring for Otindria. It wasn’t the life he’d imagined. He knows living in Dhaka has its benefits. His daughter will be adept in both Bangla and English. Her grandparents have become her best friends—each morning, Otindria drags her grandfather out on a walk to pet the neighborhood goat. But still, to Nabil, every day in Bangladesh feels like a small betrayal. “I didn’t want it to be her home, and her mother didn’t want it to be her home,” he told me. “That’s the broken promise that bothers me a lot.” St. Elizabeth’s was briefly engulfed by another private equity giant, Apollo Global Management, before Massachusetts seized it through eminent domain. He tries not to let it show. When I visited Dhaka in February, ­Otindria toddled through the apartment like a tiny queen, with Nabil as her cheerful attendant. He set up her Hello Kitty playpen in the living room, retrieved stuffed animals, and snuck her jalebi, a fried sweet, in between meals. Beneath the photos of Sungida that line most of the walls, he threw himself into playing with his daughter, never letting on that each parenting moment is tinged with sorrow. “I see ­Otindria doing everything Sungida would have wanted her to do,” he says. “But she’s not here to see it.” Nabil has grown angrier at the system that upended his life. In the spring of 2024, he began discussions with a law firm about suing Steward. (He is now pursuing a case as part of the bankruptcy.) A few months later, de la Torre—Steward’s now-former CEO—was spotted at the Olympics in Paris, attending the equestrian dressage competition at Versailles. Federal agents briefly detained him this past fall, serving a search warrant and seizing his phone—potential signs of a federal probe. But as of this writing, neither he nor anyone else involved has been charged with a crime. MPT continues to do its business with Aldag at the helm—in January, another of its hospital chains, Prospect, declared bankruptcy. ­Stephen Feinberg, the billionaire co-CEO of Cerberus, was recently sworn in as the No. 2 at the Pentagon. The 34 hospitals Steward owned when it declared bankruptcy are now in chaos. There have been hundreds of layoffs as new operators take control, and several closures. St. Elizabeth’s was briefly engulfed by another private equity giant, Apollo Global Management, before Massachusetts seized it through eminent domain and assigned ownership to Boston Medical Center—the same hospital system to which Sungida had been transferred. In October, thousands of miles from this tempest, Otindria turned 1. Sungida and Nabil had agreed during her pregnancy that they wouldn’t host a blowout for their daughter’s first birthday—it felt silly when she wouldn’t care or remember. But Nabil’s parents insisted on a party. Nabil usually rushes home from work to be with his daughter, but that night, he worked late on purpose: This birthday party felt like yet another detour from the couple’s plans, and he couldn’t stomach it—nor dissociate it from the worst day of his life. When he thinks about the future now, everything revolves around Otindria. He daydreams about teaching her to drive one day, just as he taught Sungida when they were graduate students. He isn’t worried about his daughter making good grades or getting into a top college—things Sungida would have worried about. All he wants for her is joy. “Be a chef, go to a party school, travel,” he says. “Enjoy your world.” Nabil no longer can say with any certainty that he and his daughter will leave Bangladesh when Otindria is older. He’d like to, but he’s loath to make any plans. “The future that I wanted imploded on me,” he says. “So now, I am scared to dream.” Correction, May 14: An earlier version of this story misstated when Pipeline Health declared bankruptcy.

Title: Nearly 7,000 workers are out as Microsoft confirms across-the-board layoffs
URL: https://qz.com/microsoft-lays-off-7000-workers-1851780460
Time Published: 2025-05-13T15:58:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) is laying off about 3% of its workforce, its largest headcount cut in more than two years. The layoffs have not been formally announced via press release or SEC filing but were first reported on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it’s laying off about 3% of its global workforce. With around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people — making it the company’s largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023. Microsoft framed the move as part of “organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” (What, not “vibrant” or “robust”?) Unlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts. The news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Microsoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020. The tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), and Google (GOOGL-1.57%) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring. Amazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called “year of efficiency,” and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google’s parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM-0.74%), Spotify (SPOT+5.12%), and Lyft (LYFT-1.87%) also trimmed deeply. By 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to “focus on the core,” often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story. While the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers’ group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday’s move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative.

Title: Trump secures $600 billion Saudi investment pledge on Gulf tour

US President Donald Trump secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States after the oil power accorded him a gala welcome at the start of a tour of Gulf states.Trump punched the air as he emerged from Air Force One to be greeted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on energy, defence, mining, and other areas.The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, according to a White House fact sheet that called it "the largest defense cooperation agreement" Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defense companies in areas including air and missile defense, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said."Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum," the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a US-Saudi Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Trump's visit.

(credit: REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER)"We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion," he said.Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms. Reuters reported in April that the US was poised to offer the kingdom an arms package worth well over $100 billion."I really believe we like each other a lot," Trump said during a meeting with the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.The US and Saudi Arabia had discussed Riyadh's potential purchase of Lockheed F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters, referring to a military aircraft that the kingdom is long thought to have been interested in.It was not immediately clear whether those aircraft were covered in the deal announced on Tuesday.Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. "While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over," Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih told the US-Saudi investment forum."As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen," he said before Trump's arrival.Trump was shown speaking with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund governor Yaser al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, and Falih as he toured a hall that showed off models for the kingdom’s flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.Trump called the Saudi crown prince a friend and said they have a good relationship, according to a pool report from the Wall Street Journal, adding that Saudi investment would help create jobs in the USBIG INVESTMENTSBusiness leaders at the investment forum included Larry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock; Stephen A. Schwartzman, CEO of asset manager Blackstone; and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Musk chatted briefly with both Trump and the crown prince, who is otherwise known as MbS, during a palace reception for the US president. And joining Trump for a lunch with MbS were top US businessmen including Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.MbS has focused on diversifying the kingdom's economy in a major reform programme dubbed Vision 2030 that includes "Giga-projects" such as NEOM, a futuristic city the size of Belgium. Oil generated 62% of Saudi government revenue last year.The kingdom has scaled back some of its ambitions as rising costs and falling oil prices weigh.Saudi Arabia and the US have maintained strong ties for decades based on an ironclad arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and the superpower provides security in exchange.MbS' ties with Trump have been smoother than with his predecessor, Joe Biden. Their relations were strained by the 2018 killing of Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US intelligence believed the killing was ordered by MbS. He denied involvement.Trump did not include Israel on his schedule although he wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the Gaza war.Israeli officials have put a brave face on Trump's decision but there are growing doubts in Israel about its position in his priorities as frustration mounts in Washington over the failure to end the 19-month-old war.Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups' leaders, have at the same time given Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies.US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman at the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails.Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding accords brokered by Trump in his 2017-21 first term under which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel.But opposition by Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters.

U.S. equities were mixed at midday, boosted by tech stocks and a new report showing consumer inflation came in lower than expected. The Nasdaq was up 1.5%, and the S&P 500 rose almost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower as UnitedHealth Group shares tanked. Nvidia (NVDA) shares advanced as President Trump moved to open up the Saudi Arabia market to artificial intelligence (AI) chips from U.S. firms. First Solar (FSLR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which pointed to the solar modules manufacturer's strength in the domestic market. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) gained when Raymond James initiated coverage with an "outperform" rating, calling the computer server maker a market leader in AI-optimized infrastructure. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares slumped when the health insurer suspended its guidance because of rising costs, and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down. The news dragged down shares of industry rivals as well. U.S.-listed shares of Honda Motor (HMC) slid after the Japanese carmaker warned new U.S. tariffs will negatively impact full-year results, and it postponed plans for building electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries in Canada because of falling demand for EVs. Enphase Energy (ENPH) shares declined on a downgrade and price target cut from Barclays. Analysts cited concerns about future demand for the firm's residential solar products. Oil and gold futures gained. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was higher. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for major cryptocurrencies were mixed, with bitcoin slightly higher. TradingView

President Trump signed the economic cooperation agreement with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and co-chaired the Saudi–U.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh. During the forum, Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Aramco, said that the Saudi state giant is signing today a $3.4-billion agreement to expand the Motiva refinery in Texas to integrate chemicals production. Motiva Enterprises, controlled by Saudi Aramco, operates the huge Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery is the second largest in the United States by operable capacity, after Marathon Petroleum’s 631,000-bpd refinery at Galveston Bay, Texas, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration as of January 1, 2024. Currently, the Motiva refinery produces conventional gasoline, commercial aviation fuel, ultra low sulfur diesel, export (high cetane) diesel, and Texas low emissions diesel. Aramco is also signing on Tuesday agreements with U.S. companies NextDecade and Sempra, Nasser said at the forum. “The US is really a good place to put our investment,” Nasser noted. Aramco is signing a memorandum of understanding with Sempra to receive about 6.2 million tons per year of LNG, the executive added. Last year, Aramco signed a non-binding agreement to buy LNG from Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG project and potentially acquire 25% in the project’s Phase 2. Under the non-binding Heads of Agreement (HoA), Aramco and Sempra discussed a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for LNG offtake of 5.0 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion project. The Saudi-U.S. investment forum was also attended by Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, and Elon Musk, among other prominent U.S. entrepreneurs.

Title: It Awaits Your Experiments
URL: https://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=11511
Time Published: 2025-05-13T15:27:47Z
Full Content:
You may have heard of Christian Bök. You may have read about him on this very blog if you’ve been hanging out here long enough. Perhaps you were even one of the very select few to witness the seminal talk I gave back in 2016[1]—“ScArt: or, How to Tell When You’ve Finished Fucking”— which climaxed with a glowing description of Bök’s magnum opus, then still in progress. And if you read Echopraxia, you’ll have encountered—without even knowing it— a brief cameo of that work near the end, suggesting that at least in the Blindopraxia timeline, he’d brought his baby to fruition. Truth to tell, I didn’t know if he was actually going to pull it off for the longest time. I thought he’d given up years ago. The story so far: back in the early two-thousands Christian Bök, famous for accomplishments lesser poets would never even dream of attempting (he once wrote a book in which each chapter contained only a single vowel) started work on the world’s first biologically-self-replicating poem: the Xenotext Experiment, which aspired to encode a poem into the genetic code of a bacterium. Not just a poem, either: a dialog. The DNA encoding one half of that exchange (“Orpheus” by name) was designed to function both as text and as a functional gene. The protein it coded for functioned as the other half (“Eurydice”), a sort of call-and-response between the gene and its product. The protein was also designed to fluoresce red, which might seem a tad gratuitous until you realize that “Eurydice”’s half of the dialog contains the phrase “the faery is rosy/of glow”. Phase One involved engineering Orpheus and Eurydice into the benign and ubiquitous E. coli, just to work out the bugs. Ultimately, though, the target microbe was Deinococcus radiodurans: also known as “Conan the Bacterium” on account of being one of the toughest microbial motherfuckers on the planet. To quote Bök himself: Astronauts fear it. Biologists fear it. It is not human. It lives in isolation. It grows in complete darkness. It derives no energy from the Sun. It feeds on asbestos. It feeds on concrete. It inhabits a gold seam on level 104 of the Mponeng Mine in Johannesburg. It lives in alkaline lakelets full of arsenic. It grows in lagoons of boiling asphalt. It thrives in a deadly miasma of hydrogen sulphide. It breathes iron. It breathes rust. It needs no oxygen to live. It can survive for a decade without water. It can withstand temperatures of 323 k, hot enough to melt rubidium. It can sleep for 100 millennia inside a crystal of salt, buried in Death Valley. It does not die in the hellish infernos at the Städtbibliothek during the ﬁrebombing of Dresden. It does not burn when exposed to ultraviolet rays. It does not reproduce via the use of dna. It breeds, unseen, inside canisters of hairspray. It feeds on polyethylene. It feeds on hydrocarbons. It inhabits caustic geysers of steam near the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park. I’d love to quote all seven glorious and terrifying pages, but to keep within the bounds of Fair Use I’ll skip ahead to the end: It is totally inhuman. It does not love you. It does not need you. It does not even know that you exist. It is invincible. It is unkillable. It has lived through five mass extinctions. It is the only known organism to have ever lived on the Moon. It awaits your experiments. As things turned out, it had to await somewhat longer than expected. The project hinged upon molecular techniques that did not exist when the experiment began. Christian taught himself the relevant skills— genetics, proteomics, coding— and enlisted a team of scientists (not to mention a supercomputer or two) to invent them. His audacity was more than merely inspiring; some might even call it infuriating. As I railed back in 2016: It was fine when Art came to science in search of inspiration; that’s as it should be. I suppose it was okay— if a little iffy— when Science started going back to Art for solutions to scientific and technical problems. But this crosses a line: with The Xenotext, we have reached the point where Science is being used solely to assist in the creation of new art. Scientists are developing new techniques just to help Christian finish his bloody poem. Up to now, we’ve generally been in the driver’s seat. Insofar as a relationship even existed, Science was the top, Art the Bottom. But Art has now started driving Science. Science has discovered its inner sub. As a former scientist myself, I was not quite sure how to feel about that. But however that was, I knew Christian Bök was to blame. Fortunately, Science got a reprieve. The project hit a bump at E. coli. Eurydice fluoresced but the accompanying words got mangled. When they eventually cleared that hurdle and moved to Phase Two, Deinococcus fought back, shredding the code before it ever had a chance to express. Conan, apparently, does not like people trying to play with its insides. It’s already got its genes set up just the way it likes them. Unkillable. That, as far as I knew, was where the story ended ten years ago. Christian released The Xenotext: Book One in 2015, documenting his efforts and gift-wrapping them in some gorgeous and evocative bonus content, but the prize remained out of reach. He headed off to Australia to follow other pursuits; then to that oversurveilled and repressive shithole known as the United Kingdom. We fell out of touch. I assumed he’d given up on the whole project. Oh me of little faith. Because now it’s 2025, and he fucking did it. The Xenotext is live and glowing in Deinococcus radiodurans: iterating away inside that immortal microbial bad-ass that feeds on stainless steel, that resides inside the core of reactor no. 4 at Chernobyl, that does not die in the explosion that disintegrates the Space Shuttle Columbia during orbital reentry. Christian Bök did not give up. Christian Bök did not fail. Christian Bök is going to outlive civilization, outlive most of the biosphere itself. The rest of us might think we achieve artistic immortality if our work lasts a century or three. Bök blows his nose at such puny ambitions. His work might get deciphered by Fermi aliens who finally make it to our neighborhood a billion years from now. It could be iterating right up until the sun swallows this planet whole. It’ll almost certainly be around for Dan Brüks to find in the Oregon desert, mere decades down the road. The Xenotext: Book Two comes out from Coach House in June 2025. It would be well worth the price just for the the acrobatics and anagrams and sonnets, for the way it remixes science and fiction and the classic canon of dead white Europeans[2]. It contains poetry to entrance people who hate poetry. It juggles space exploration and the Fermi Paradox and the potentially extraterrestrial origins of Bacteriophage φx174. But its rosy flickering heart is that dialog iterating away in Conan even as I type. A reinvention, almost a quarter-century in the making. A fucking monument if you ask me, equal parts revelation and revolution. If you happen to live in or around Toronto, it’s getting an official launch on May 27 at The Society Clubhouse, 967 College St, from 7-9pm. It’s one of a half-dozen Coach House titles that will be launched that night, and no doubt all six authors are worthy in their own right. Still. You know who I’m going for. Maybe I’ll see some of you there. Δ Δ Literature encoded into juggernaut microbial genes by a man who, facetiously taking at face value the Mooring-dialect North Frisian meaning of his surname, is literally called Bible. This has apocalyptic implications Inb4 Pope Influenza I Clever. But can it sing “Row, row, row your boat”? I think that’s on the list. Right after “evolve opposable thumbs”. A bacterium with opposable thumbs? Fair shot, it can’t do much worse than H sapiens has. Several lifetimes ago, waaaay back when I was hilariously crashing out of premed, I can remember the biochem prof cited this one weird trick—where a single DNA sequence expresses multiple proteins just by adjusting the read offset—as evidence of God’s handiwork. Although personally I think it much more compelling evidence that Earth is a vast massively parallel supercomputer with lovely crinkly bits grinding the combinations for 10 million 3.5Bn years. Never send a brain to do an algorithm’s work, that’s my motto nowadays. And DNA’s already halfway to Forth. Tip o’ the hat to Mr Bök for his God-level advance trolling of whatever race of hyperintelligent cockroaches eventually arises in our wake. Only the paperback? What is wrong with the publishing industry today? If I’m okay with read-and-forget, I’d buy a pdf or whatever the current thing is, epub or mobi or whatever. If I’m willing to both shell out and spend the precious shelf space in my shoebox of a domicile on some sliced dead wood, I’d want it to be durable. Physical. Bequeathable. Hard-cover. What’s this obsession with paperbacks? They don’t really last, and don’t save any more trees either. And I’ll be fucked if this right here is the kind of literature one reads on the tube during the commute, folding the corner instead of a bookmark before shoving it into the pocket of one’s coat. Xenotext doesn’t need to be read by puny meatsacks. Xenotext is immortal. I mean, the text that is not meant to be read, the signal that is not meant to be received, the meaning that is not meant to be understood is just noise. Isn’t it? And a large part of our problem right now is we make too much noise. Not in the sense of loud sounds, but in the sense of rubbish, garbage, bonkers signals. Rorschach is known to consider these things an attack. I’m not the only person who finds paperbacks easier to read. Oh really? I this a thing? I wasn’t aware it was. I have acquaintances who claim superiority of paper over digital, but I’ve never heard of hardcover vs paperback before. >Christian taught himself the relevant skills – genetics, proteomics, coding – Sentences like these demonstrate the enormity of some peoples sheer intellectual superiority. Compared to a dude like him, i might as well be pond slime, happily gurgling away mindlessly in some nutrient broth. I am beyond impressed. Holy shit, this is one of those stories that remind you to never quit art, even if you are not sure if you are on board with this life thing anymore. Thank you for bringing it up, Dr. Watts 🙂 Nice. Apropos of nothing, apparently quantum energy teleportation has been confirmed. It’s not the telematter stream sending antimatter yet, but it looks interesting. One can hope we will NOT live to see ads casually added into someone’s genetic material …? Well, by the time Echopraxia takes place, you can apparently find the specs for the Denver sewer system in genes, so… If it encodes a useless protein, does that make it a disadvantageous trait that will be eliminated by selection pressure? More likely it’ll be selectively neutral; a single gene doesn’t take a whole lot of energy to maintain, and our own genomes are loaded with useless-but-non-deleterious code that’s accumulated over our evolutionary history. If there were some teensy Deinococcus-eating predator out there that hunted by sight, I suppose the glowing Conans would be more vulnerable to predation. Otherwise I don’t think it would make much difference. Ah. What I think is more like this: synthesising bioluminescent proteins consumes organic matter but produces no benefit. This should at least cause natural selection to favour their unmodified counterparts? Perhaps we should also deploy some versions with gene poem that don’t express, just as a backup. “Useless” is relative: to random mutation it’s all raw materiel. Sure it’s non-coding today, but rotate a few bits just-so and it’s sharks with fricking laser beams evolved on their heads tomorrow. […] Read More […] ewww. You just copypasted a few paragraphs from this article under another name on a random website to get a backlink? what a shame I did not. Someone scraped this post without attribution. ewww. Did you just copy paste a few paragraphs from this article under another name on a random website to get a backlink? what a shame It’s spammy bot BS. Pay it no heed. : : : DO NOT TAUNT THE XENOTEXT : : : Nature of humanity, bud. We will poke it with a stick. You’ve heard about Moore’s law but have you heard about Carlson curve? It’s a similar thing but for DNA sequencing. Between the year Bök has begun his work and the current year the cost of DNA sequencing has been reduced by 200%. In twenty something years any basement dwelling punk might pull this off. I hadn’t, so looked it up. WP’s graph is lagging but it looks like cost has dropped a whole magnitude over the last 10 years. Did you mean 2000%? Quite impressive when the 2001 bill for a human genome was $100M and now it’s approaching $100. Six magnitudes. Moore, clocking 4, looks distinctly sedate. I like my cyberpunk with 1980s electronics and 2080s genomics. “I just do eyes…” Damn straight. — Apropos of other things, tweaking Interstellar’s “Mountains” to ⅛ tempo makes an interesting Oort cloud experience for those needing a Big Ben fix. (Use a YouTube downloader to grab it as .mp3 file as YT shits ads all through it otherwise.) What kind of maths is this? 200% reduction implies that it was reduced to zero, and then reduced by its cost again, so whoever wants to sequence something should be paid for it. So if the cost was 1000 bucks, now after a 200% reduction you’d receive 1000 bucks if you order a sequencing. 200% = 2.0, so a reduction would be one-half of the original cost. I suspect that wasn’t what parent intended. Never trust percentages, shifty sods. Damn, that’s impressive. Not just that he pulled this off, but that he took his dedication to his art up to a whole different level. Incredibly inspiring and impressive. But, to play the cynic, I worry the specific sequence (if not the entire protein itself) will be altered or lost entirely after several (if not a few) generations unless a selective pressure maintains the precise sequence. The hypothetical super-Bök molbio artist would have to generate a poem sequence which gives rise a protein of such unalterable importance to bacterial function that genetic drift is strongly selected against. Perhaps a bacterium is too simple an organism for this, and more complex life needs support this endeavour… May ’25 • UK funds a series of geoengineering experiments to “buy time” in the race against climate change. Small-scale and cautious, they say. Ecologically sound, they say. Will certainly not be used as an excuse to not cut carbon emissions, they say. We’ll see. April ’25 • Trump opens protected marine conservation area to commercial fishing. Because of course. PopSi coverage here. • Latest marine heatwave leaves over 80% of the world’s coral reefs impacted by bleaching. On the upside, this is an official NOAA report on an ongoing environmental catastrophe. I thought they weren’t allowed to do that any more. • Bypassing the International Seabed Authority, Trump signs executive order opening the deep sea for commercial mining. Because why refrain from fucking up an ecosystem just because it’s out of sight? • Ocean heatwaves three times longer and 1°C hotter thanks to climate change. Only a paywalled preview link because the University of Toronto seems to have inexplicably stopped subscribing to PNAS, and I can’t find the paper on Sci-Hub. PopSci summary here • “Entire asset classes are degrading in real time”. Top insurance company warns that climate change is “on track to destroy capitalism“. And yet, they say that as though it’s a bad thing. March ’25 • Canadian company in negotiations with Trump to mine seabed. Because MAGATs aren’t the only assholes on the planet. • South Korean wildfires worst on record. • Another new buzzword for these times: “Global Weirding“. AKA, “climate whiplash”. • BP abandoning its net-zero pledges because, well, why the fuck not? They were empty anyway. February ’25 • Looks like the odds are the AMOC won’t be collapsing completely before the end of the century— just “significantly weakening” by 50-80%. After 2100, though, all bets are off. Summary article here. • NOAA is now refusing to mention the C-words when reporting record-breaking global temperatures. • Last January hottest on record: 1.75°C above preindustrial baseline. So much for La Niña cooling the place down. • “1.5°C is dead” is so passe. Based on these findings, James Hansen now says that 2°C is dead, too. In other news, the North Pole is 20°C warmer than it should be. Assuming it’s not just some Chinese hoax. January ’25 • Net Zero has “suspended operations” after Blackrock bails (the last straw in an ongoing procession of desertions from the world’s financial institutions). • Four of Canada’s largest banks have also quit Net-Zero. • I just learned a new word: “panzoonotic”. H5N1 is one. So far it’s infected over 48 mammalian species. • Lancet study estimates civilian deaths in Gaza at around 64,260 from Oct 7 2023, to June 30 2024. Fun fact: that’s about 70% higher than estimates from the supposedly Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health. • The six biggest banks in the US have all bailed on Net Zero. Because who cares about that shit now that Trump’s back in charge? • Looks like a sea level rise of at least 1 m is now inevitable no matter what we do, as early as 2070 under current emissions. 2-3m is “very likely”. On the plus side, that means most of the world’s oil ports will be underwater in less than fifty years. December ’24 • Over half the current US population has been exposed to adverse concentrations of lead, resulting in elevated levels of mental illness. Explains a lot. • Geoffrey Hinton ups his guesstimate of AI-caused Human extinction to “10-20%” over the next 30 years. Honestly, at this point, the sooner the better. • 2024 officially the “hottest year on record“. • A whole new potential kind of environmental apocalypse: “mirror life“, based on biomolecules of reversed chirality. I’m sure we have nothing to worry about, though, now that the scientists have warned us of the dangers. Society always listens when scientists warn it of the dangers. Fun fact: the whole mirror-life thing is old news in science fiction, dating at least back to 1970’s Spock Must Die! by James Blish, later to be ripped off by Sheri Tepper’s Grass in 1989. • “International talks on curbing plastic pollution fail to reach agreement“. Oh, and in case you missed it: the multicorporate entity “Alliance to End Plastic Waste” generated 1,000 times more plastic waste than they cleaned up. November ’24 • So it turns out that the usual collection of assholes and shitstains did, in fact, manage to effect real change at COP29 after all: they deleted the bit about “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. Honestly, I don’t know why they even bothered. It’s not like those things are ever binding anyway. • 1.5° “deader than a doornail“. In other news, the Allieds storm the beaches of Normandy. • Ah, crap: the planet will continue to warms for centuries even after we hit net zero. Assuming we ever do. Tech specs here. • Oh, lookee here: Cop29 CEO filmed agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals at climate summit. No big surprise, mind you. It’s not like this hasn’t happened before. • Biodiversity COP16 turns out to have been a total clusterfuck. Not that we were expecting anything different, given that he international community has never met a single fucking goal in this particular arena. October ’24 • Over a third of the world’s tree species currently in danger of extinction. • Currently on track for 2.6-3.1°C warming by century’s end. • Monkeypox has figured out how to spread via direct human-to-human contact, a step up from its original zoonotic mode of spreading. We’ve seen this before. Anyone remember Zika? • Risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapsing in the near term have been “greatly underestimated”. • A decent overview of the various and sundry corporations who’ve chosen to renege of their climate pledges. • Time to give up on direct-air carbon capture. It was always a fool’s errand anyway. 2.7°C, here we come. September ’24 • Everything tickety-boo! Nothing to see here! August ’24 • Current ground temperatures on Antarctica are on average 10°C higher than normal (whatever “normal” means these days). Up to 25°C higher, in some spots. July ’24 • This decade’s methane emissions—which have 80 times the heat-trapping power of CO2— have “far exceeded baseline projections” and are accelerating. In completely unrelated news, Kamala Harris has reneged on an earlier pledge and, if elected, will not ban fracking after all. • And now it’s Jasper’s turn to burn to the ground. By way of poetic justice, the Trans-Mountain pipeline just happens to pass through that burg.) • In unrelated news, last Sunday—July 21, 2024— was the hottest day on record, ever. Well, until Monday, anyway. • The next pandemic is expected to be “Bird Flu” again? What is this, a clip show? Where’s Nipah when you need it? Or even the Black death? May ’24 • Renewable energy in the US produced “$249 billion in climate and health benefits” from 2019 to 2022. PopSci coverage here. • Working paper (not yet peer reviewed) concludes that “macroeconomic damages from climate change are six times larger than previously thought“. A mere 1°C increase (which, mind you, we’ve already passed) leads to a 12% decline in world GDP. PopSci coverage here. If reality-based threats aren’t enough to get the politicians off their asses, maybe a threat to the global economy will. Not holding my breath, though. • Global ocean temperatures have been breaking historical records for a solid year now. • Leafhoppers devastating Argentinian crops. Winter frosts used to keep the insects in check, but, you know. • We’ve already spent a year above 1.5°C, but that’s nothing; 78% of surveyed IPCC scientists expect us to blow past 2.5°C by century’s end (current trends point to 2.7°C). “We live in an age of fools”, one scientist opines. • Biodiversity loss is biggest driver of disease outbreaks; climate change and invasive species also implicated. (Strangely, urbanization was a negative correlate. Which seems weird given the high-density thing…) • Annual jump in global CO2 levels hits new record. Blame El Nino. Sure. April ’24 • EPA mandates that US coal-fired plants have to put up or shut down. Okay. Conditional green. We’ll see if this survives the inevitable industry onslaught. • Climate change predicted to cost the global economy $38 trillion annually by midcentury, or six times what it would cost to keep warming to a merely-catastrophic 2°C. Of course, all those Exxon-Mobil CEOs will be long dead by then, so don’t expect anyone to move on this. • Arctic permafrost now a net carbon producer. • Globally, hottest March in History. That’s ten consecutive monthly world records broken. Remember when they were warning we might exceed 1.5°C as early as 2030? We already did that. For the past solid year. • The East Antarctic Plateau just hit 38.5°C above its seasonal average. In related news, emperor penguin colonies are collapsing. March ’24 • 2023 was 0.2°C higher than expected and no one knows why. (No, it wasn’t El Nino.) • Great Barrier Reef bleaching again. Fifth time in eight years, if anyone’s counting. • “Last Chance Tourism” is a thing now. “Quick, they’re going extinct! How can we make a buck off that?” • A good candidate for Least Surprising Development Of The Week: major banks abandoning the “bare minimum environmental standards” for fossil fuel development that they themselves invented. Not that those were in any way binding in the first place, of course. • It’s official: Avian Flu now in mainland Antarctica. (Previous cases were only confirmed among island populations south of the Circle.) February ’24 • First Human fatality from recently-discovered arctic Alaskapox virus (who readers may remember from my recent story “Contracting Iris“): also bubonic plague surfaces in Oregon. Cats implicated in both cases. Go cats! • North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation en route to catastrophic tipping point”: 1m Atlantic sea-level rise, Europe cools so fast that “no realistic adaptation measures can deal”. Significant uncertainty remains regarding when exactly the collapse will occur. Let’s just ignore that Nature paper that says it could happen as soon as 2025… • New “Category 6” hurricane proposed. Because hurricanes are way stronger now than they were in the old days. January ’24 • Air pollution from Alberta Tar Sands 1,900-6,300% higher than previously reported. Meaning the tar sands emit as much air pollution as all other Canadian sources combined. • Greenland losing thirty million tones of ice per hour, 20% more than previously thought. Another nail in AMOC‘s coffin. • Norwegian government approves deep-sea mining. I’ve spoken to a couple of Norwegian scientists who think this is a very bad idea. They have a lot of company. • We made it to 1.48°C in 2023! 0.17°C higher than last year, and we could break 1.5 in just a few months! Come on, you ecocidal shitstains! Let’s show those candy-ass coral reefs who’s boss! • Raptors on the African savanna in deep shit. 88% have declined over the past 40 years; 69% are in danger of extinction. • So, H5N1 is killing polar bears now. How very seasonal. What, did you think pandemics were only a human thing? 2023 November ’23 • COP28 lobbyists to present meat as ‘sustainable nutrition’. Because apparently, putting an oil company CEO in charge of the whole event wasn’t sufficiently farcical. • Earth just experienced the hottest year in recorded history, and probably within the past 125,000 years. A quarter of the global population exposed to “dangerous extreme heat events” for at least a 10-day period. They say next year’s going to be worse. • UK forests facing “catastrophic collapse” within 50 years. On the up side, that means they’ll outlast civilization itself by a good two decades. • Number of species in danger of extinction doubles to two million. Personally I bet that’s extremely conservative; we don’t even know how many species are out there in the first place. • World’s governments plan to produce more than twice the 1.5°C-limit for fossil fuels by 2030. Plus ca change. October ’23 • Avian flu makes it to Antarctica, after a massively successful South American Tour that killed “500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone”. Let’s see if they can top that down on Bird Island. • Another tipping point passed: looks like we’re losing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet no matter what we do; there’s “no significant difference between mid-range emissions scenarios and the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement.” Goodbye, coastal cities. PopSci coverage here. • Twenty one species removed from the Endangered species list because they’re, um, extinct. Well, that’s one way to clear the backlog. September ’23 • Swiss glaciers decline 10% by volume in two years. Measurement stopped on some glaciers because they’re, um, gone already. • OK, I’ll admit this is pretty cool: Water from portable desalinator potentially “cheaper than tap water”. Solar powered, fits in a suitcase, 4-6l/hr. • Senior oil executives providing “support” to COP28. Plus ca change… • 98% of Europeans breathing air that exceeds WHO pollution standards. Two-thirds of them are breathing air that’s over twice those standards. Not a green post because pollution is, you know, bad. But not a red one either, because the associated annual deaths of 400,000 of the world’s most cancerous pest species has gotta be some kind of silver lining, yes? • Nipah outbreak in India. When this bug goes global—and sooner or later, it will go global—it’s gonna make smallpox look like a head cold. • Antarctica warming “much faster than models predicted“, because of course it is. PoSci coverage here. • Hottest Summer Evar, by two-thirds of a degree. From the Dept. of Duh. • Tropical mosquitoes bring their disease-vectoring ways to Paris, en route to the Baltic. Right on schedule. August ’23 • Leader of religion that forbids birth control laments environmental destruction. Well, I suppose it’s easier than doing something about all kids they’ve raped and murdered. • Oh, and filed under “News So Unsurprising It’s Barely Even News”: July 2023 officially the hottest month ever recorded. A record that’ll probably stand for about thirty-one days. • Amazon leaders fail to commit to end deforestation by 2030. Something about not wanting to give up “extractive industries”. • Tick-borne deathly red-meat allergies may affect hundreds of thousands! That’s one way to cut back on meat consumption—and by the way, did I call it or what? Now, if only some feisty ecoterrorists could port that trait into mosquitoes and horseflies… • Irony of the week: Stricter controls on maritime pollution increase global heating. Seems all those airborne sulfates increased cloud reflectivity; now they’ve been reduced, more solar radiation gets through. • Ocean surface temperature now hotter than any time in recorded history, and still climbing. Parboiled fish floating belly-up off Florida. • Hey, everybody: leprosy’s back! (Just in Florida so far, but not for long: armadillos are leprosy reservoirs, and thanks to climate change those guys are already as far north as Nebraska.) July ’23 • The deep sea gets a one-year reprieve from mining. China finally backed down. • Antarctic sea ice at record low. • G20 countries fail to reach agreement on cutting fossil fuels again. Because, you know. Maybe it’s all just sunspots or something. • And July 4 was even worse. • July 3 was the hottest day the planet has known since we started keeping records. June ’23 • The nation of Tuvalu is uploading itself into the digital realm. Because its days are pretty clearly numbered in this one. • Climate change amped the odds of the current Texas heat wave by five times. On the up side, it couldn’t have happened to a more deserving state. Except maybe Florida. • In case you were getting bored of humans changing the global climate, here’s something new: Humans are also changing the axial tilt of the planet by depleting groundwater reservoirs. • Oh, bother. Canada’s on fire again. • Ice-free summer Arctic ahead no matter what we do. Previous models, suggesting we might save the ice cap if we really cut back our emissions, underestimated ice loss. All together now: the optimists are always wrong, and the pessimists are too optimistic. May ’23 • Still on track to hit 1.5°C by 2027. Of course, if you only look at temperatures over land masses, we blew past that benchmark years ago. • Alberta—heart of the Canadian fossil fuel industry, home to the Athabasca Tar Sands, hotbed of climate-change denialism—is on fire. Gosh. Who could have seen this coming? April ’23 • World’s ocean surface temperature hits record high. After three years of La Niña tamping down on the cooker, it’s back to business as usual. • Increased flow of Antarctic meltwater compromising abyssal circulation. Deep ocean stagnates; shallow ecosystems starve for want of upwelled nutrients. • Canadian bank world’s biggest financier of global fossil fuel projects. It’s not like you can expect the federal government to chip in—they already gave more than $15 billion to the oil industry in 2022 alone… March ’23 • 8000-km swathe of sargassum weed headed for the Florida coastline. What’s not to like? Massive overgrowth, increased bioproductivity, increased CO2 absorption. The only thing it fucks up is Florida’s human population—and really, who deserves it more? • ‘Murrica’s “environmental president” approves 576m-barrel oil drilling project in Alaska, “potentially producing more than twice as many emissions than all renewable energy projects on public lands by 2030 would cut combined.” • Humans and their livestock now account for 98% of the planet’s terrestrial mammalian biomass. (When you include marine mammals we’re only at 94%, if you want to put a positive spin on things.) • New UN finalizes deal to protect (most) international waters. Although I might downgrade this to orange depending on what it ends up saying about deep-sea mining. • New GI-tract disease caused by plastics documented in seabirds. • The Guardian tries to put a happy face on the fact that emissions continued to rise in 2022 by saying at least they didn’t rise as much as they did the year before. February ’23 • Antarctic sea ice hits record low. In unrelated news, it’s 15°C today in Toronto. In the middle of February. • Wind and solar were EU’s top electricity source in 2022. Despite—or maybe because of—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. January ’23 • Now even neural nets are telling us that things are worse than we thought: 80% chance we hit 2°C by 2065 even assuming carbon neutrality. • World’s oceans hottest ever recorded in 2022. Absorbed about 10 zettajoules more heat than in 2021. • Current carbon offsets are bullshit. • Best-case (1.5°C) scenario: Half of all glaciers gone by 2100. Current trajectory: two thirds. December ’22 • COP15: Politicians desperate for some kind of win praise a non-binding biodiversity agreement with no enforcement, no accountability, and which doesn’t even mention commercial fishing or agriculture. (At least it can’t possibly do worse than its predecessor, which failed to meet a single one of its goals.) November ’22 • “None” now second-largest religious demographic in England and Wales. The US is still a fundamentalist nuthouse, of course, but you take your wins where you can find them. • Over 20K dead from this year’s heat waves in western Europe alone. (Although maybe this should be a green post. Surely fewer of us is a good thing?) • This year’s carbon emissions on track to be highest ever. Way to bend that curve, guys. • Previously-documented decline in human male fertility is accelerating! • Fossil fuel reps at COP27 up 25% over last year.”More than the combined delegations from the 10 most climate-impacted countries.” • Equipment designed to cut methane emissions is failing. • Past eight years hottest on record; each hotter than the one before. Follow the link if you want the ugly and consistent details about methane, CO2, arctic sea ice, glacier melt, and sea level rise. Bet you can guess the bottom line, though. October ’22 • No credible pathway to 1.5°C; currently on track for 2.8°C by 2100. Only hope is a radical and immediate transformation of global energy, food, and financial systems. Good luck with that. September ’22 • Christianity could well be a minority religion in the US within the next few decades. And it’s not other religions taking up the slack, either; the population is becoming increasingly nonreligious. This assumes that no massive social upheavals cause everyone to turn back to religion as a security blanket, mind you. Not necessarily a safe bet these days. • At least a third of Pakistan is underwater. August ’22 • All by itself, Greenland Ice Sheet decline will cause at least a 27cm rise in sea level no matter what we do now. “a very conservative rock-bottom minimum … Realistically, we will see this figure more than double within this century.” PopSci coverage here. • On the plus side, life expectancy in the U.S. continues to decline. Assuming anyone, you know, still trusts the CDC. • Australian wildfires are probably enlarging the Antarctic ozone hole. And I thought the ozone layer was the one thing we’d managed to put right. • Oh, great: polio’s back. • Apropos of nothing in particular, turns out even a teensy nuclear war could cause global famine. On the up side, a major war would cut the numbers of the world’s most pernicious pest species by more than half. • Okay, I’ll give you this one: the curiously-named “Inflation Reduction Act” at least gets the US off the sidelines and taking a first step. Even though it’s not nearly enough. Even though the cheerleaders seem to be breezing past the fact that the IRA makes offshore windfarm development contingent on an annual sacrifice of 60 million acres to the fossil fuel industry. At this point, you take what you can get. July ’22 • Democratic Republic of Congo opening vast tracts of forest (including gorilla habitat) to oil extraction. “Our priority is not to save the planet”, proclaims their government’s climate guy. Don’t sweat it, dude. It’s not anyone’s priority. • Monarch butterflies officially endangered. Kind of surprised it took them so long. • From Britain to China, record-breaking heat-waves, forest fires, and evacuations. “Not a very normal situation,” reads one quote from a Portuguese meteorologist. Yes it is, dudette. These days, it very much is. • US Supreme Court guts the EPA’s options for regulating carbon emissions. Because why just force people to have more babies when you can do that and increase the carbon bootyprints of each larva in the bargain? June ’22 • Desertification: Central Asian deserts have expanded by a hundred kilometers since the eighties. May ’22 • Exxon fails to wriggle out of going on trial for fucking over the planet and lying about it. This does absolutely nothing to mitigate climate change or to de-oil a single marine organism, but at least the odds of fucking up a few of the culprits may have improved a little. • You know those 50+°C heatwaves that are all the rage in India and Pakistan these days? A hundred times more likely now, thanks to climate change. Once every three years, instead of once every three centuries. • Pollution responsible for 1 out of every 6 deaths on the planet. That’s nine million a year. Put that together with the ongoing decline in Human fertility, this problem might just take care of itself. • It’s now basically a coin toss whether we blow through 1.5°C within the next five years. • 91% of the Great Barrier Reef bleached this year. And the year’s not over. • Fossil industry embarked on 646Gt worth of “carbon bombs“, more than enough to blow through the planet’s entire remaining carbon budget for a 1.5°C scenario. Then again, 1.5 was always a pipe dream anyway, right? And besides, there’s a war on. • Swapping out just 20% of global beef production for mycoprotein could, by midcentury, cut deforestation (and associated emissions) in half. April ’22 • Over 15,000 mammal-to-mammal zoonoses expected over the next half-century as a result of climate change. • A fifth of all reptile species are threatened with extinction. Popsci coverage here. • And of course, mere hours after the IPCC’s latest report emphasises yet again how we absolutely cannot afford to approve new fossil-fuel megaprojects, the Trudeau government approves a new fossil-fuel megaproject. They promise it won’t have any “significant adverse environmental effects”, though. Cross their hearts. • 1.5° is officially off the table. Now, the most optimistic scenario hinges on sucking carbon back out of the air to compensate for the inevitable “overshoot”. March ’22 • Great Barrier Reef bleaching yet again, during an El Nina this time (which is supposed to be when corals catch a break from the heat). “It’s also happening faster than was predicted 20 years ago.” • Coal surging, renewables stagnating, thanks to the war. I guess we can kiss goodbye even Cop26’s delusional and miniscule hopes of 1.5°C. On the up side, none of this matters in the event of a nuclear war. • 175 countries pledge to act on plastic pollution. It’s not a deal so much as a pledge to work out a deal, but at least it’s a legally-binding deal covering the the whole production cycle. Popsci coverage here. • Latest IPCC Report is out. “brutal“… “bleakest warning yet”… impacts “sooner and greater than we originally thought”… Ah, what’s the use. We’ve heard it all before, and we do fuck-all. February ’22 • U.S. Oil Industry Uses Ukraine Invasion to Push for More Drilling at Home. And less environmental regulation. And more pipelines. You know the list. • SW US megadrought now worst in at least 1,200 years. At least. • Global methane hits 1,900ppb. Been spiking since 2007. Arctic-thaw feedback suspected. January ’22 • Coal is in ascension again. All hail the post-covid economic recovery. • Ghost Flights are back. Up to 2.1 million tons of greenhouse gas emitted as empty planes fly around the skies of Europe. Didn’t we end this shit back in 2020? December ’21 • You know how the Arctic is warming “twice as fast” as the rest of the world? Turns out it’s actually warming twice as fast as that. So, four times. Yet another case of exceeding the worst-case scenario. November ’21 • The moral case for destroying fossil fuel infrastructure. About the only thing I’d disagree with is the claim that there’s no moral case for taking human life. Oh, and “Ethical” would have been a better word to use than “moral”. • In the wake of COP26, Biden administration selling off drilling rights to 80 million seabed acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Way to “lead by example”, you duplicitous scumbag. • Oh, here’s a cute little post-mortem tidbit from COP26: researchers were frequently prevented by the conference organizers from accessing the rooms where negotiations were taking place“. Kinda tells you all you need to know about how science factors into these things. • You may have heard that if every country honors the commitments made thus far at Glasgow, we could be looking at a merely disastrous increase of 1.8°C, instead of the downright catastrophic 2-plus.Wrong. Try 2.4°C. (PopSci coverage here.) • Hey, the grass roots finally accepts the reality of climate change! Of course, we’re still willing to do fuck-all about it. October ’21 • You know how we’re supposed to cut emissions in half by 2030? Current pledges, even if implemented, will only cut them by 17% according to the most recent UN Report (popsci coverage here). Yet another “thundering wake-up call”; so much for “building back better”. • 45% of Americans Don’t Believe Humans Cause Climate Change. Which probably still makes them smarter than Pyro650: at least most of them admit that climate change exists. • Fossil fuel industry gets subsidies of $11,000,000 a minute. Also, Biden signed as many drilling permits in the first six months of his administration as Trump did in his first year, during a time when no new drilling can occur past 2021 if we want to have a hope in hell of achieving even the flaccid half-assed commitments of the Paris Accord September ’21 • Coral reef coverage declined by 50% worldwide between the fifties and 2007. And that was before all those massive bleaching events hit the Great Barrier Reef. • Still on track for 3°C, thanks to virtually every Paris signatory not even coming close to meeting their commitments. (The only country that is on track? Gambia.) • Of course, they haven’t won a lot yet— and the moment they start, governments will probably just pass legislation to ban these kinds of lawsuits— but attribution studies are coming into their own when it comes to suing corps and countries for screwing the pooch on climate change. (Personally I’d like to see more in the way of jail terms and death penalties— but as usual, the good news is so far and few between you pretty much have to take what you can get.) August ’21 • Big Oil has a plan to deal with climate change. Basically, it’s suck up every drop of oil we can, for as long as we can, while getting governments and taxpayers to fund our ultimate and inevitable switch to renewables. • Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions are about to undergo the biggest jump since 1990, thanks to the post-covid economic ‘recovery’. Ah well. At least they’re learning to live with the whole catastrophic-flooding thing… • Hey, here’s a teensy glimmer of hope: coal-free steel. Note they didn’t say “carbon-neutral” steel, so I don’t know how “green” it is. Still. We take what we can get. • Down in the US, this passing Summer of the Furnace has changed people’s minds about climate change not at all. Hell, 1 in 4 don’t even think it’s any big deal. • Parts of the March ’22 IPCC report leaked seven months early by scientists fearing the usual governmental watering-down. How fucked are we? See for yourself. • Yup. We’re fucked even more unequivocally than we were the last time the IPCC checked in. Popsci coverage here. • Revenge Travel. It’s a thing. • Oh goodie. Looks like the Gulf Stream might be shutting down. Too many downstream effects to list here. • Last July worst for wildfires, globally, since records began. • The Greenland Ice Sheet lost enough meltwater to cover Florida to a depth of two inches last, um, Tuesday. 8.5 billion tonnes in one day. It’s not even a record. July ’21 • “Everything is on fire.” Siberia hit by unprecedented burning. • Remember “Limits to Growth”? Turns out they were right all along. Recent analysis suggests that business-as-usual will lead to global societal collapse around 2040, right on schedule. J. Industrial Ecol. report downloadable here. • Even now—even now— the G20 won’t agree on commitments to combat climate change. Four of the miserable fuckers have put forth plans that would lead to a 5C rise in global temperatures if everyone adopted them. • Not to be outdone by the Europeans catastrophic flooding also in China! All that coal-powered economic growth, finally paying off. • Tired of the same old stories about heat waves, droughts, and wildfires? You’re in luck! Climate change causes catastrophic flooding in Europe, too! Climate Change. A Catastrophe for Every Mood. • The Amazon rainforest is now a net carbon producer. Goodbye, “Lungs of the Planet”. It was nice knowing you. • June ’21 was the hottest ever recorded in the US. Wanna bet July breaks that record? • Last June’s inferno over on N’Am’s western reaches was rendered 150 times more likely due to climate change. • Hate to sound like a broken record but once again, worse than the worst-case scenario: Nobody saw the Lytton conflagration coming. Scientists never factored “heat domes” into their models. June ’21 • ExxonMobil lobbyists filmed saying oil giant’s support for carbon tax a PR ploy. ExxonMobil shocked and appalled by these allegations. May ’21 • Electric cars ‘will be cheaper to produce than fossil fuel vehicles by 2027’. One source even says this will happen by 2024. • Europe to clamp down on air and water pollution under green deal. “The overarching goal is to eliminate all harmful contamination by 2050.” Good words. Let’s hope the actions live up to them. • Heartened by so many governments suddenly hopping on the green bandwagon? Even if they all keep all their commitments, we’re still looking at a 2.4C global increase. Ah, well. 1.5C was always “aspirational” anyway… April ’21 • Australian Academy of Science: holding warming to 1.5C now “virtually impossible“. (As usual, the Hope Police object to the dire wording, but even they admit it’s “super-challenging” and “hanging in the balance”.) • Coal is powering the post-covid economic recovery. This year’s coal usage expected to rival peak burn of 2014. • European droughts over the past five years are “unprecedented in the past 2,110 years“. Popsci coverage in The Guardian. • Carbon emissions to soar in 2021 by second highest rate in history. Massive surges in coal power in the US and China. The Covid Dip. It was nice while it lasted. • Only 3% of the world’s ecosystems remain intact. We might be able to recover up to 20% through species reintroduction if we really get off our asses, but what are the odds? March ’21 • Disease outbreaks more likely in deforestation areas. Well, duh. • Bottom trawling releases as much carbon as air travel. Not to mention the sheer physical damage of clearcutting entire benthic ecosystems. Popsi coverage here. • Bladeless, even windless wind power. From giant wobbling dildos to streetlamp-mounted little turbines that harness air displaced by passing traffic. • Former CIO for sustainable investing at BlackRock states that “Green Investing” is Bullshit. Turns out capitalism is incompatible with decarbonization pretty much by definition. Who knew. • Geoengineering goes mainstream. At least, the National Academies of Sciences thinks we should be taking a serious look. • Falling sperm counts ‘threaten human survival’. It’s old news—and I remain skeptical that linear regression is the appropriate analysis in any case—but wouldn’t it be nice if our sperm counts really did hit zero by midcentury? And we’ve got no one to blame but ourselves. • Hey, new Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Actually it’s been going on since January, but who can keep track? (Also it now appears that Ebola can lie dormant in a host for up to 5 years, and then jump out and out break all over again…) • Northern California’s Kelp forest ecosystem reduced by 95% since 2013. Crash instigated by a “multiyear marine heat wave”. • UN agrees on standards to put a monetary value on ecosystems. Works great until Jeff Bezos pulls out his checkbook and says Okay, I’ve bought the Amazon. Let’s burn the fucker down.” • Global carbon emissions on track to surpass pre-Covid levels. December emissions 2% higher in 2020 than in 2019. Goodbye, Covid dip. You were nice while you lasted. February ’21 • Chance of keeping global warming below 2C currently 2%. Goodbye, coral reefs. • Nineteen out of twenty Australian ecosystems are seriously fucked (i.e., “experiencing potentially irreversible environmental changes.”) Guardian coverage here. • China doubles the number of “Protected” animal species. Now there’s, like, six of them. (Just kidding. Really, it’s nice to see they’ve given up on the whole wolf-extermination thing.) • Global “Peace Levels” have declined 2.5% since 2008. (Actually this dates from last August but I just discovered it now.) In your face, Stephen Pinker. • 20% of all Human mortality due to particulate air pollution. 30% in east Asia. Guardian coverage here. • US Cities are vastly underestimating their carbon emissions. The uncounted difference adds more annual emissions than the entire state of California. PopSci coverage here. January ’21 • Past estimates of sea-level rise are too conservative. The worst-case scenario gets even worse, yet again. PopSci coverage here. • Global ice loss now following IPCC’s worst-case trajectory. Which might be relatively good news, given how many indicators are trending to worse than worst-case. PopSci coverage here. • Electric cars will be cheaper than the fossil-powered variety by 2023-2025. Of course, fossil-powered SUV sales are still going through the roof. • Increased rewilding of landscape in rich countries, thanks to declining birth rates. See what happens if we just ignore that whole Judeo-Christian “fill up the world with thy numbers” edict? • Three quarters of the world’s sharks and rays are in danger of extinction. As usual, a conservative estimate. Popsci perspective here. • Electric car batteries with five-minute charging times produced. 1000 – 2500 recharge cycles without significant battery degradation. • Future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. “The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms—including humanity—is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts.” Popsci summary here. • World’s insects suffering ‘death by a thousand cuts’. A series of papers in PNAS. Popsci summary here. • Solar now cheapest electricity in history. Oil use still hasn’t peaked— and won’t without “stronger climate action”— but it’s something. • 2020 hottest year in recorded history. Technically tied with 2016, but 2016 cheated by getting an El Niño boost. December ’20 • Monarch butterflies are endangered under the ESA, but won’t get protection because ‘it costs too much’. Not the only such species, by a long shot. • Mass die-off of birds in south-western US ’caused by starvation’. One guess what the drought that caused the starvation was caused by. • Fighting the Covid recession by amping up fossil-fuel production. Imagine my surprise. • Global human-made mass now exceeds all living biomass. This doesn’t even include landfills. • Water now trading on the Stock Market. Hey, at least they haven’t monetized the air we breathe. Yet. • EU’s biggest oil producer closes deal to shut down its entire oil industry. Legally binding on future governments and everything. • November 202 hottest November on Record, beating out runners-up 2016 and 2019. During an El Nina no less, which acts to cool the planet. • By 2030, world’s governments plan to produce more than double the fossil fuels than would be consistent with curbing global warming. Meeting even the half-assed Paris accords requires cutting fossil fuel production by 6% annually. Current plans: an annual increase of 2%. • Media Reframes Projected Failure to Meet Carbon-Reduction Targets as Being ‘Within Striking Distance’ . If every country honors their pledges (which virtually none have done up to this point) we’re still looking at 2.1C increase by centuries’ end. But hey, let’s move the goalposts and call it a win. • Cloned Meat Goes Commercial. Only in Singapore, so far. And highly carbon-intensive until it scales up. But in a world in which 96% of mammalian biomass is people and livestock, it’s a start. November ’20 • Once covid passes, we plan on driving even more. We’re a bit more restrained when it comes to flying, at least. Be still my heart. October ’20 • A fifth of the world’s countries are in danger of ecosystem collapse. Odd. I didn’t realize that “ecosystems” respected international boundaries… • Arctic methane deposits starting to release, scientists find. Preliminary findings. Still awaiting confirmation. But if true, another cascade has begun. • China pledges Carbon-neutrality by 2060. The bad news is, talk is cheap from the world’s biggest coal-burner. Good news is, totalitarian regimes can turn on a dime if they really want to. None of that messy pandering-to-the-voter bullshit. • Over half the Great Barrier Reef has disappeared since the nineties. As usual, this estimate is conservative; it doesn’t include major bleaching events over the past year. • California wildfires spawn first ‘gigafire’ in modern history. One fire, one-million-plus acres. • Climate change could tip 1.45 million km2 of Amazonian rainforest to savannah by century’s end. Admittedly a conservative estimate. Popsci coverage here. September ’20 • World fails to meet a single one of the UN’s 2010 Aichi biodiversity targets to put the brakes on global ecocide. Not a single fucking one. Report here. • Northern Hemisphere’s 2020 summer hottest in recorded history. • Global wildlife populations down by 68% since 1970. Two thirds down, one to go. August ’20 • Greenland Ice Sheet has passed Point of No Return. Already the largest single contributor to rising sea levels. Now there’s no Off switch. • Rising temperatures on track to kill as many people as all current infectious diseases combined. Original paywalled study here. July ’20 and earlier • Forget future development; emissions resulting from projects already committed/underway mean we can kiss 1.5°C goodbye as an attainable target. • Covid Means Fewer Children!. Even better, the fertility decline preferentially affects those with the biggest carbon bootprints (i.e., urbanites in rich countries). • 2020: the worst year ever for the fossil fuel industry. “We’re still in for a long and ugly fight”, they admit. Still. • Virtual extinction of Polar bears within eighty years due to climate change. But it’s not all bad. A few straggly survivors may be all Coca Cola needs to keep its advertising campaign within the bounds of good taste. • Green power beats fossil fuels for first time in Europe. Still less than half, and pandemic-temporary. But something. Also when there’s a renewables surplus they pay you to consume electricity. • Unsuitable for ‘human life to flourish’: Up to 3B will live in extreme heat by 2070. • Record-breaking Siberian winter keeps 2020 on track to be hottest year in recorded history. Covid Pause? What Covid pause? • It hit 80F in the Arctic this week. Not to mention the zombie fires. • 2019: the Hottest Year in Europe’s Recorded History. • Ecuador To Sell A Third Of Its Amazon Rainforest To Chinese Oil Companies. • Amazon could switch from carbon sink to carbon source within twenty years.. “Decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.” • The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing its third mass-bleaching event in five years.. Hey, just because nobody’s talking about it doesn’t mean it’s stopped happening. • E.P.A., Citing Coronavirus, Drastically Relaxes Rules for Polluters. But it’s okay, because they’re also asking companies to “act responsibly”. • Australian Bushfires destroyed over a fifth of the continent’s temperate broadleaf forests. This year alone. Who knows what next year might bring? • Global carbon emissions fall 2%. It’s pathetic progress and utterly insufficient, but I’ll take what I can get. • Australia’s Bushfires Completely Blasted Through the Models. They weren’t supposed to get this bad for another eighty years. • A quarter of climate-change tweets are from bots. The vast majority of them denialist. • January 2019 warmest in recorded history. • Good news for a change: Global emissions didn’t increase in 2019. • Climate change displaced 17.2 million from their homes in 2019. • Atmospheric triflouromethane—a greenhouse gas 12,000x worse than CO2— reaches record levels. • We’re currently adding 5 Hiroshima bombs worth of heat per second to the world’s oceans. And climbing. • Climate threats now dominate long-term risks. Global leaders finally admit risks outweigh those from cyberattacks, pandemics, geopolitical conflict and weapons of mass destruction. Well, duh. • Earth just had its hottest decade on record. NASA’s Gavin Schmidt admits 1.5C goal unattainable. • 2019 UN Emissions Gap Report (global emissions have to drop by 7.6% annually starting now or we’re even more fucked). • 3.2C unless emission-control efforts tripled. • Greenhouse gases accelerated to new peak in 2018. • Nature: Predicted extent of global flooding is triple previous estimates.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Zeke Miller, Associated Press Zeke Miller, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Leave your feedback RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as he kicked off a four-day Middle East trip with a focus on dealmaking with a key Mideast ally while shared concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and the war in Gaza dragged on in the background. WATCH: Trump delivers remarks at U.S.-Saudi investment forum Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, warmly greeted Trump as he stepped off Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital. The two leaders then retreated to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides were served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun belts. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said later during a brief appearance with the crown prince at the start of a bilateral meeting. They later signed more than a dozen agreements to increase cooperation between their governments’ militaries, justice departments and cultural institutions. Additional economic agreements were expected to be inked later Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment conference convened for the occasion. Prince Mohammed has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the U.S., but Trump teased $1 trillion would be even better. The pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital — an exceptionally rare sight. Trump and Prince Mohammed also took part in a formal greeting and lunch at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace, gathering with guests and aides in an ornate room with blue and gold accents and massive crystal chandeliers. As he greeted business titans with Trump by his side, Prince Mohammed was animated and smiling. It was a stark contrast to his awkward fist bump with then-President Joe Biden, who looked to avoid being seen on camera shaking hands with the prince during a 2022 visit to the kingdom. Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a U.S. intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. READ MORE: Trump will visit Gulf Arab states this week as pressing crises flare in Gaza and Iran But that dark moment appeared to be distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side. Later, the crown prince will fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince. Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77. Trump picked the kingdom for his first stop, because it has pledged to make big investments in the U.S., but he ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term. The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by Trump’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Trump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine are isolating the U.S. from allies. READ MORE: Russian drones attack Ukraine after Kremlin rejects 30-day ceasefire proposal He’s expected to announce deals with the three wealthy countries that will touch on artificial intelligence, expanding energy cooperation and perhaps new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The administration this month announced initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia’s fighter jets. But Trump arrived in the Middle East when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach. Before the trip, Trump announced Washington was halting a nearly two-month U.S. airstrike campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route. The administration didn’t notify Israel — which the Houthis continue to target — of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration’s negotiations with common adversaries. READ MORE: Who is Edan Alexander, the Israeli-American hostage released by Hamas? In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t notified by the administration until after talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing U.S. nuclear talks with Iran only when Trump announced them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month. “Israel will defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said last week following Trump’s Houthi truce announcement. “If others join us — our American friends — all the better.” William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit is remarkable. “The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf … are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said. Trump, meanwhile, hopes to restart his first-term effort to normalize relations between the Middle East’s major powers, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Trump’s Abraham Accords effort led to Sudan, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. But Riyadh has made clear that in exchange for normalization it wants U.S. security guarantees, assistance with the kingdom’s nuclear program and progress on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. There seems to be scant hope for making headway on a Palestinian state with the Israel-Hamas war raging and the Israelis threatening to flatten and occupy Gaza. Prince Mohammed last week notably hosted Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh in Jeddah on the official’s first foreign visit since assuming office in April.

US president Donald Trump secured a $600 billion (€537 billion) commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States. Mr Trump, who was beginning a tour of the Gulf states, was greeted by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on defence, energy, mining and other areas. The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion (€127 billion), according to a White House fact sheet that called it “the largest defence co-operation agreement” Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defence companies in areas including air and missile defence, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said. “Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum,” the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a Saudi-US Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Mr Trump’s visit. “We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion,” he said. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms. [ A ‘very nice gesture’: Trump accepts gift of new Air Force One plane from QatarOpens in new window ] Mr Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington’s priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. Mr Trump left Israel off his schedule, although he wants Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the 19-month-old Gaza war. Israel’s military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hizbullah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups’ leaders, have at the same time given Mr Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies. [ Trump’s direct hostage talks with Hamas signal his growing impatience with Israel’s Gaza warOpens in new window ] US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman over the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme. Mr Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails. Mr Trump told the investment forum he wants to offer Iran a new and better path towards a more helpful future. If no new nuclear deal is reached, he said, Tehran will face maximum pressure. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding accords brokered by Mr Trump in his 2017-21 first term, under which Arab states including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel. Mr Trump said it was his “fervent hope” that Saudi Arabia would soon sign its own normalisation agreement with Israel, adding: “But you’ll do it in your own time.” Mr Netanyahu’s opposition to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters. Mr Trump also said he would order the lifting of sanctions on Syria at the behest of the crown prince, in a huge boost for interim Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa as he seeks to stabilise a country shattered by war. The US imposed sanctions on Syria during the rule of Bashar al-Assad, and had kept them in place since he was toppled from power in December after more than 13 years of war. The US president also said he would send secretary of state Marco Rubio to Istanbul for talks on the war in Ukraine on Thursday. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he would attend only if Russian president Vladimir Putin – who suggested the talks – is also there. The Kremlin has yet to say whether Mr Putin will take part. Mr Trump is also sending Mr Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, three sources familiar with the plans said. Mr Kellogg earlier said that Mr Trump will show up in Istanbul if Mr Putin attends the talks. – Reuters © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

VLADIMIR Putin has refused to meet brave Volodymyr Zelensky in Turkey for Ukraine peace talks - despite President Trump's offer to bring the Russian tyrant to the table. Zelensky had challenged the Russian dictator to meet him face-to-face to turn the screw and make a deal, but mad Vlad has instead made his latest dodge from peace. The bombshell list for the Russian delegation at Thursday's meeting was released by the Kremlin - with Putin's name missing. And a mere few minutes after it was established the tyrant wouldn't be in attendance, it was confirmed that Trump wouldn't be coming either after previously hinting he might. It's unclear whether Zelensky will still go to Istanbul. Speaking on Air Force One on Wednesday, Trump said: "[Putin] would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. "I don’t know that he would be there if I’m not there. We’re going to find out." Russia is still sending a troop of heavyweights - including a presidential advisor, top diplomat, and senior military and intelligence officials. But if Putin were on the delegation list too, it would have marked a serious indication that he could be interested in ending the bloody war. The Russian dictator last week proposed to hold direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday May 15 - but had then gone silent on his offer. Zelensky on Tuesday said he was willing to go to Turkey but only if Putin was also there. Trump is currently in the Middle East as part of his first major tour since taking over the Oval Office. He is currently in Qatar for a state visit. It comes one day after Don inked the biggest arms deal in history to supply Saudi Arabia with $142bn worth of weapons, the White House said. The sale is part of a landmark $600 billion deal with Jeddah that was signed after Trump landed in Riyadh to kickstart his Middle East tour on Tuesday. The President has also taken a shot at rival Iran in a marquee speech, saying the Islamic Republic needed to make up its mind about whether it wanted to chase developing a nuclear weapon and get war or choose peace and a trading relationship. It marks Trump's first state visit of his second administration, after Saudi Arabia was also the first state visit in 2016. Follow our live blog below for the latest updates: Trump on Tuesday hailed a former terrorist warlord as “a young, attractive guy”. The maverick US President gushed with praise after meeting Ahmed al-Sharaa, who ousted Syrian tyrant Bashar al Assad last year. Trump also agreed to lift US economic sanctions on Syria which have been in place since 2011. Sharaa, previously linked to al-Qaeda, spent years in US custody after being captured in Iraq and once had a £7.5million bounty on his head. Now interim Syrian president, he shook hands yesterday with Trump in Riyadh, along with Saudi Arabia’s leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also joined a meeting by video link, which Trump later said went “great”. He described Sharaa as a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.” But it puts Trump at odds with Israel, which issued warnings against the former terror master and has continued military action against its long-standing enemy. Asked if Sharaa can normalise relations with Israel, Trump said: “I told him, ‘I hope you’re going to join once you’re straightened out and he said yes’. But they have a lot of work to do.” Read the full story here. Twin celebrations of Trump's birthday and the Army's 250th anniversary will include as many as 25 tanks rolling through Washington in a celebration that will cost $25 million to $45 million, US officials have revealed. The US Army had long been planning to move troops and equipment to the National Mall in Washington on June 14 as part of its anniversary celebration. Plans now include an extravagant parade since the event coincides with Trump's 79th birthday. Two US officials revealed the eventual cost could be as high as $45 million. One of them said the cost included several million dollars more than it would have without a parade. The official added that the Army is planning on sending about two dozen M1 Abrams tanks for the celebration. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will travel to the US to meet Trump when he has returned from his Middle East tour. The trip will aim to "reset the strategic relationship between the two countries", according to Ramaphosa's office. Relations between the US and South Africa have nose-dived since Trump took power. The American cut all financial aid to the country - and then granted refugee status to a group of its white population on the grounds they face racial discrimination there. Multiple congressional Republicans are amongst those concerned by the wildly controversial $400million airplane Qatar wants to gift Trump. Rep Senator Rand Paul said: “I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety. I wouldn't take it." Democrats rivals slammed the plan as an illegal foreign donation and national security threat. When Donal Trump announced he would be lifting all sanctions on Syria, it surprised even his own officials. Figures from the State and Treasury Departments scrambled to figure out how they would even go about cancelling the sanctions, according to four official sources. Many of the measures have been in place for decades - and must now be unstitched. Britain will strip Chinese ingredients from UK-made medicines bound for the US after pressure from Donald Trump, The Sun can reveal. The condition is part of the landmark UK-US trade pact signed last week, which slashed tariffs on British steel and car exports. In return, Britain had to swallow strict national security measures - including a clause to stop the UK becoming a “backdoor” for Chinese goods entering the American market. The US President has long accused the Communist giant of rigging trade, stealing IP and flooding Western markets with cheap state-backed goods. It is understood one key demand is that any drugs exported from Britain to America must be free from Chinese-made chemicals and components. A Government source told The Sun: "We are going to work with the pharmaceutical industry to secure the supply chain." Read the full story here. Iran's president said his country would not "bow to any bully" - after Trump criticised Tehran earlier on his tour. President Masoud Pezeshkian said of Trump: "He thinks he can come here, chant slogans, and scare us. "For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed. You came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully." The President branded Iran "the most destructive force" in the Middle East at an investment summit in Saudi on Wednesday - and blamed it for the continued instability. He also reiterated Washington's commitment to blocking Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons - and threated "maximum pressure" if Tehran rejected his "olive branch". Neither Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump will attend the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul on Thursday, their officials confirmed. The list for the Russian delegation was released this evening - and Putin wasn't on it. Then, shortly afterwards, a US official confirmed that Trump would not be making the trip. Trump had hinted he would join Zelensky and Putin if he thought there was the chance of a deal being cut. It's not clear whether Putin's absence was the reason for Trump sitting out the negotiations. Guests at the state dinner in Doha tonight are being served roasted camel as part of the "culinary and cultural experience", reports Sky. The dish is considered a delicacy in Qatar and often rolled out for special occasions. Camel meat tastes similar to lean beef, but slightly gamier. Democrats have flown a banner over President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, drawing attention to his new, cosy, Qatari ties. The banner which reads "Welcome to Qatar-a-Lago" flew across the blue Palm Beach skies while Trump was in Doha for day two of his tour of the Middle East. Speaking at a state dinner hosted by the Emir of Qatar, Donald Trump has said Doha is working with the US on securing a deal with Iran, adding that he wants to see the country "thrive". He said: "It's a terrible situation and we want to do the right thing. "We want to do something that can save millions of lives." Piers Morgan was pictured being welcomed by Donald Trump at the Emir of Qatar prior to the state dinner. President Trump has been pictured greeting Kelly Ortberg - the chief of American manufacturing giant Boeing. Earlier, Trump announced that Qatar agreed to what he dubbed the "largest order of jets" in Boeing's history. Trump's right-hand man Marco Rubio has left the Trump team in Doha and is now bound to Turkey. The US secretary of state is to meet with Nato foreign ministers tomorrow in Antalya. Rubio is scheduled to travel on to Istanbul on Friday - where the US State Department says he will be in crunch talks with his counterparts on the Ukraine war. The US and Qatar signed an agreement to generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2trillion, the White House just revealed. Donald Trump has doubled down on his reason to accept a $400million aircraft as a gift from Qatar, calling the opportunity too valuable to refuse. While en route Qatar this morning for a state visit, Trump said to reporters onboard his Air Force One: "The plane that you’re on is almost 40 years old. “When you land and you see Saudi Arabia, you see UAE and you see Qatar, and they have these brand-new Boeing 747s, mostly. You see ours next to it – this is like a totally different plane. "We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane.” The $400million jet could be the most expensive ever given by a foreign power to the United States - and will be used as his new Air Force One for much of his time in office. However, Trump's move to accept the palatial aircraft has raised a lot of eyebrows - including from his right-wing supporters like Ben Shapiro. While signing the deal, Trump compared the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump said to the Emir: "We came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours. "You two guys get along so well and like each other, you remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. Both tall, handsome guys that happen to be very smart." President Trump and the Emir of Qatar have signed agreements to purchase aircraft from US Boeing. Qatar Airways had placed a "record" order for 160 planes from Boeing worth more than $200 billion. Trump said: "It's over $200 billion but 160 in terms of the jets. That's fantastic. So that's a record. "It's the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That's pretty good." Both parties have also agreed on a defence cooperation - inked by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth - which includes a statement of intent. A letter of offer and acceptance for MQ-9B drones was also signed. The US president was given an unusual motorcade as he arrived in Qatar on the next stop on his historic four-day visit to the Middle East. Donald Trump's car was escorted through Doha by bullet-proof Tesla Cybertrucks. Tesla is run by Elon Musk who joined US officials for Saudi talks on Tuesday. Donald Trump is due to sit down with Qatari officials soon to have lunch before completing a signing ceremony. It is unclear what the president is set to sign as just 24 hours ago he announced a historic deal with Saudi Arabia. © NEWS ENTERPRISES, INC.

Title: What's Behind The 300% Rise In AVGO Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Although Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has seen an approximate 4% decline year-to-date, reflecting a broader decline in the NASDAQ index influenced by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including ongoing tariffs and trade tensions, some of these worries have recently lessened. The landmark trade agreement between the U.S. and U.K., along with the recent 90-day pause in high tariffs between the U.S. and China, indicates a possible change in this situation. Despite this recent downturn, AVGO stock has achieved considerable long-term growth, rising over 300% since the beginning of 2023. This impressive performance is mainly due to the following factors: We will explore the details of these factors. While AVGO stock has performed remarkably well, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Broadcom’s remarkable recent performance is significantly due to two main factors: its rapidly growing AI product line and the strategic acquisition of VMware in 2023. This collaboration has instigated a noteworthy 64% rise in Broadcom’s revenue, increasing from $33 billion in 2022 to $55 billion over the last twelve months. A pivotal element contributing to this growth is the company’s AI revenue, which reached $12.2 billion in the fiscal year 2024, showcasing an impressive 220% year-over-year increase. This growth in AI revenue is propelled by robust market demand for Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) along with its Ethernet products. Through its extensive suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity offerings, and semiconductor products, Broadcom has strategically aligned itself to make the most of the ongoing generative AI surge. Broadcom has consistently maintained an adjusted net margin exceeding 45% in recent years. This strong recent profitability is a result of its strategic engagement with the expanding AI market, especially through high-demand custom AI accelerators and networking solutions. The transformative acquisition of VMware has further enhanced revenue and margins by incorporating a substantial infrastructure software component with an emphasis on recurring subscriptions. Alongside continued strength in their core semiconductor business and a constant focus on operational efficiency and strong cash flow generation, these aspects have positioned Broadcom for enduring financial success. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) have been a vital factor in the company’s financial transformation and a key element in its improved overall valuation. This effect is evident in Broadcom’s adjusted price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which has significantly increased threefold, from 14x in 2022 to 41x at present. This rise in investor enthusiasm was driven by the company’s enhanced financial performance, marked by strong sales growth and higher profitability. This financial change unfolded against a backdrop of a challenging market environment, particularly the inflation shock of 2022 that resulted in a substantial stock market correction. During this tumultuous period, AVGO stock saw a sharp 36% decline, dropping from its January 2022 peak of $67 to a low of $43 by October 2022. This decline was more significant compared to the S&P 500’s 25.4% peak-to-trough drop. AVGO’s recovery was gradual, only returning to its pre-crisis peak by May 2023, reflecting both the harsh market conditions and the company’s inherent resilience. Currently priced at $220, Broadcom’s stock holds a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41, based on its trailing adjusted earnings per share of $5.36. This multiple is considered steep, and it is considerably higher than the stock’s three-year average P/E ratio of roughly 30x. Nonetheless, this premium valuation seems warranted due to the company’s substantial opportunities in the rapidly growing AI sector. These AI-driven developments are anticipated to support sales growth. While the company has demonstrated an average sales growth rate of 24% over the last three years, forecasts for the next three years expect mid-teens average growth. Notably, bottom-line growth is projected to be even more pronounced than the revenue increase. For long-term investors, any retreat in AVGO stock may signify an opportunity, considering the company’s strong fundamentals and positioning in the AI market. However, those apprehensive about near-term volatility should contemplate suitable strategies, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio strategy, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the previous four-year span. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

May 13, 2025 09:45 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The Artificial Intelligence (Al) in cybersecurity market is rapidly expanding as organizations increasingly adopt Al-driven solutions to improve threat detection, prevention, and response to evolving cyber risks. The network security segment dominated the Al in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. A report from an industry insider said that: “The global AI in cybersecurity market assessment, based on type, includes network security, endpoint security, application security, and cloud security. The network security segment dominated the AI in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. Securing networks against malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks has become a top priority as enterprises increasingly adopt digital transformation initiatives and cloud-based infrastructures.

The data loss prevention segment is expected to witness the fastest AI in cybersecurity market growth during the forecast period due to the rising emphasis on safeguarding sensitive and confidential information.” Active companies in cybersecurity news today include Cycurion Inc. (NASDAQ: CYCU), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET), Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). The report continued: “Organizations face heightened risks of accidental leaks or intentional data breaches with increasing volumes of data being generated and exchanged. AI-driven DLP solutions offer advanced capabilities to monitor, identify, and prevent unauthorized data transfers or exposure, ensuring compliance with strict data protection regulations such as Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and others. This growing need for robust data security across industries positions the DLP segment for accelerated adoption during the forecast period. North America dominated the AI in cybersecurity market revenue in 2024 due to the region's advanced technological infrastructure and high adoption of innovative security solutions. The presence of major cybersecurity companies such as IBM and AWS and early adopters of AI-driven technologies across industries such as finance, healthcare, and government especially contributed to market dominance.” Cycurion Inc.

(NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application. AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale. Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations. Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete. The best-selling platform surged past $1 billion cumulative bookings in FY25 Q2, making it our fastest offering to reach this milestone. Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks doubled down on cloud security with the introduction of Cortex Cloud, converging its industry-leading CNAPP and CDR capabilities on the unified Cortex platform. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) recently announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats. Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) recently released its 2025 State of SMB Cybersecurity Report, uncovering a widening gap between cybersecurity awareness and readiness among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While 93% of SMBs consider themselves knowledgeable about cybersecurity risks and 83% report having a plan in place, just 36% are investing in new tools – and only 11% have adopted AI-powered defenses. Based on insights from SMB decision-makers across industries and company sizes, the research reveals that despite rising awareness, most SMBs still lack the budget, tools and in-house expertise to stop modern threats. With attacks becoming more advanced and frequent, SMBs need protection that’s easy to use, affordable to deploy and built to scale with their business.

AI-driven DLP solutions offer advanced capabilities to monitor, identify, and prevent unauthorized data transfers or exposure, ensuring compliance with strict data protection regulations such as Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and others. This growing need for robust data security across industries positions the DLP segment for accelerated adoption during the forecast period. North America dominated the AI in cybersecurity market revenue in 2024 due to the region's advanced technological infrastructure and high adoption of innovative security solutions. The presence of major cybersecurity companies such as IBM and AWS and early adopters of AI-driven technologies across industries such as finance, healthcare, and government especially contributed to market dominance.” Cycurion Inc.

(NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application. AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale. Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations. Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete. The best-selling platform surged past $1 billion cumulative bookings in FY25 Q2, making it our fastest offering to reach this milestone. Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks doubled down on cloud security with the introduction of Cortex Cloud, converging its industry-leading CNAPP and CDR capabilities on the unified Cortex platform. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) recently announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats. Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) recently released its 2025 State of SMB Cybersecurity Report, uncovering a widening gap between cybersecurity awareness and readiness among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While 93% of SMBs consider themselves knowledgeable about cybersecurity risks and 83% report having a plan in place, just 36% are investing in new tools – and only 11% have adopted AI-powered defenses. Based on insights from SMB decision-makers across industries and company sizes, the research reveals that despite rising awareness, most SMBs still lack the budget, tools and in-house expertise to stop modern threats. With attacks becoming more advanced and frequent, SMBs need protection that’s easy to use, affordable to deploy and built to scale with their business.

Title: Trump's trade agreement with China is another big win for investors
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-popped-us-china-trade-truce-economists-wall-street-warnings-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-13T12:07:42Z

Hello there! Want to be a LinkedIn influencer? (Yes, that's a real thing.) A recent study that included interviews with more than two dozen influencers broke down the key things to remember when building that network. In today's big story, the stock market popped after a temporary trade agreement between the US and China was reached. We look at what some top Wall Street minds expect going forward. Don't forget to subscribe to Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Check out five of Goldman Sachs' AI tools aiming to revolutionize how its employees work. Tech: Amazon is rekindling with its old flame FedEx, according to a document obtained by BI. Business: Costco's gold bars are such a hot commodity, the retailer put new limits on buying them. But first, another big win for investors. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. President Donald Trump's tariffs had investors heading for the hills. A little over a month later, they can't come back fast enough. An agreement between the US and China to significantly reduce tariffs for 90 days sent the market skyrocketing. Major indexes gained considerable ground, erasing the losses from Trump's April 2 "Liberation Day." In all honesty, we should have seen this coming. On May 8, Trump told a press pool at the White House, "You better go out and buy stock now." It was the second time in the past few months that Trump has telegraphed market-moving news coming down the pipeline by urging people to buy stocks. Now, investors who followed Trump's advice are sitting pretty. Tech stocks, including the all-important Magnificent Seven, were up big since many have supply chains and/or customers tied to China. And stocks weren't the only thing heading in the right direction. The progress made on US-China trade talks has people less fearful of a recession. Betting markets dropped the chances down to 40% from 52%, where it was last week. Can the stock market's good vibes last, though? That's what some of the brightest minds on Wall Street tried to think through when reacting to the news. Here's a rundown of their thoughts. Not to be a party pooper, but the trade agreement reached between the US and China is still only temporary. The two sides must iron out many issues before anything permanent is established. Let's not forget the actual tariffs. Both sides have significantly lowered the trade taxes against each other (China 125% to 10%, US 145% to 30%), but the risk remains. Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler said Monday that the current trade policies still "appear likely to generate significant economic effects even if tariffs stay close to the currently announced levels." Roger Altman, founder of investment bank Evercore, estimated the US's overall tariff rate is around 14% compared to 3-4% during President Joe Biden's administration. All of that is to say, the concerns economists have always had about Trump's trade policy — a rise in inflation, slower economic growth — are still very much on the table. 1. How Goldman Sachs is supercharging employees with AI. The bank's GS AI Platform has been growing its suite of tools aimed to boost employees' productivity. BI spoke with multiple Goldman executives over the past year and compiled intel on five of its AI tools. Here's everything we know. 2. Retirement travel dreams, deferred. BI spoke to several retirees who planned on spending their golden years traveling. Now, between rising costs and financial concerns, they said they're either finding creative ways to afford it or rethinking their plans altogether. 3. Another House representative made money on tariff turmoil. It's not just Marjorie Taylor Greene: Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz bought tens of thousands of dollars of stock during the market chaos in April. Both lawmakers say their trades were made by an outside financial advisor. 1. Amazon is getting back together with its (Fed)Ex. The two companies, which split in 2019, signed a partnership deal in late February, according to an internal document obtained by BI. Amazon cited FedEx's "cost favorability" over UPS, which previously said it would reduce its shipping volume for Amazon packages over profitability concerns. 2. The tortoise and the hare. Last week, Bill Gates announced plans to close the Gates Foundation in the next 20 years. Instead of the foundation winding down spending, he's ramping it up. It's a stark contrast to Elon Musk's chainsaw-wielding approach with DOGE — and Musk could take some notes. 3. The women powering little tech in 2025. Meet BI's Seed 40, our annual list of the best women early-stage investors with a knack for spotting and working alongside founders. This year's honorees have placed bets across some of 2025's hottest verticals, from AI to health tech. 1. Tariffs are going to hit Gen Z especially hard. In the face of tariff price hikes, Gen Z is already disadvantaged by having less wealth than other generations. But tariffs could hit some Gen Z-specific products to the point of extinction, from Korean beauty products to anxiety meds. 2. Costco tries to stem the gold rush. The wholesaler has been putting limits on purchases of gold and other precious metals in recent months. Gold prices have been on a tear this year, and even with earlier restrictions, Costco said its inventory had sold out "within a few hours." 3. Temu's left out of Trump's tariff reprieve. Although goods from China are being taxed at 30% and not 145% for the next 90 days, Temu and Shein are still subject to high duties which remain on small packages shipped directly from China. Fortunately, Temu has a workaround. Cannes Film Festival begins. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Crypto bulls are taking a breather, leaving bitcoin BTC$102,160.67 in stasis near $103,000 ahead of the U.S. April inflation data, due at 8:30 a.m. With U.S.-China trade tensions easing, markets are, for now, optimistic about a softer-than-expected inflation print, potentially stirring up calls for Fed interest-rate cuts. This resulting risk-on sentiment could push bitcoin to new highs and accelerate the ongoing rotation of funds into alternative cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin dominance rate, or the largest cryptocurrency's share of total crypto market cap, has slipped 63% from 65%, indicating growing interest beyond bitcoin. An important point to consider amid all this is that bitcoin has led swings in U.S. assets this year. Notably, bitcoin peaked above $109,000 in January, weeks before the Nasdaq and dollar index reached their tops and entered bear markets, pricing the economic impact of rising trade tensions. Similarly, BTC's early April bottom at around $75,000 happened weeks before the selling in the dollar index climaxed near 92 in late April. Since then, the index has rebounded to 102, challenging its bearish trendline (see Technical Analysis). This price action raises a compelling question: Is bitcoin evolving to be a leading indicator for U.S. assets, while being part of the U.S. exceptionalism story, as CoinDesk noted in March? If yes, then days of tracking Nasdaq for cues on the next possible move in BTC are past. Stay alert! CoinDesk's Consensus is taking place in Toronto on May 14-16.

Title: Weight loss drugs are squeezing the food industry
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-food-industry-sales-1851780090
Time Published: 2025-05-13T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
The revolutionary GLP-1 class of weight loss drugs are racking up blockbuster sales at a pace rarely seen in the pharmaceutical industry. But the pharma industry’s gain is the food industry’s loss. Approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration just four years ago, Ozempic, Wegovy and other drugs in this category are now the best-selling medications in the United States. One in eight U.S. adults, some 30 million people, are taking the drugs, according to a new KFF poll. In survey after survey, users of the new weight loss drugs say they are cutting back on purchases of high-calorie foods and dining out less. As a result, Morgan Stanley (MS) predicts that overall consumption of soft drinks, baked goods, and salty snacks will fall 3% by 2035. One study that sent shudders through the food industry was an examination by researchers at Cornell University of purchases of 150,000 households. The study found that if one person was taking a GLP-1 drug, the household reduced its grocery spending by 5.5% within six months. Higher-income households reduced spending by 8.6%. The study by Cornell’s SC Johnson College of Business noted that the reductions were driven by large decreases in purchases of calorie-dense processed food, including an 11% decline in savory snacks. “Our findings highlight the potential for GLP-1 medications to significantly change food demand, a trend with increasingly important implications for the food industry as GLP-1 adoption continues to grow,” the researchers wrote. The changes are likely to last. In a recent survey of 1,700 consumers by the consulting firm Ey-Parthenon, respondents taking weight loss drugs said their consumption of snack foods dropped between 40% and 60%, while specialty and health food consumption climbed by almost 50%. “The survey results indicate that adoption (of GLP-1 drugs) will be rapid and long-lasting,” Ey said in its report. Restaurants may take a hit as well, according to a survey by the website Finance Buzz. More than half of those queried who were taking a GLP-1 drug said they spent less money on dining out since starting the medications, and 37% reported reduced spending on alcohol. GLP-1 drugs, also known by the generic name semaglutide, were approved for the treatment of diabetes some 20 years ago, but the category took off when it was discovered that they are extremely effective for weight loss, and with minimal side effects. The drugs mimic the GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate appetite, and can reduce calorie intake by 20% to 30% daily. Given that some 40% of U.S. adults classify as obese, the potential market is huge. Plus, the drugs may be effective against a broad range of diseases. Scientists are studying them for the treatment of heart disease, addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, symptoms of menopause, sleep apnea, and fatty liver disease. Sales are widely projected to soar from $15.87 billion in 2023 to anywhere from $100 billion to $150 billion by 2030. The drugs are costly however, running $1,000 a month and up in the U.S., and are often not covered by insurance, which limits their uptake. But prices are likely to drop as pharma companies develop oral versions of the drugs. That prospect already had food companies running scared more than a year ago. The CEO of Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, said last year that food company executives were so “scared” they were calling him for advice on how to adapt to the new world of weight loss drugs. According to its recent survey of 300 patients taking GLP-1 drugs, Morgan Stanley said that “two-thirds of patients reported eating three or more snacks per day before starting the drugs, while 74% reported eating two snacks or less after starting the drugs.” There may, however, be an upside for those food companies that offer lower-calorie options. An October 2024 survey by PwC of some 3,000 U.S. adults found that, while GLP-1 users spent about 11% less on most categories of food, 56% said they were making healthier food choices. Shane Smith, CEO of packaged meats company Smithfield Foods, told a consumer conference in March that there is growing demand for meat among consumers who are taking weight-loss drugs. Based on scanner data, it is “snacks and sugary drinks and those types of things that they’re not buying,” Smith said. “But they’re really focused on maintaining a good level of protein and high-quality protein in their diet,” Smith said. “So, we think we’re set up well as we go forward.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AST SpaceMobile: Satellite Service For Consumers Slated For Early 2026

AST SpaceMobile is still playing catchup to SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system, but the company is racing to kick off its own service in about six months. AST CEO Abel Avellan mentioned the aggressive timeline in an earnings call on Monday. “The idea is to have a beta service sometime by the end of this year. A commercial service fully open for consumers sometime during early 2026,” he said. “Our plan is for this service to be text, internet, data, and access to applications like video conferencing.” SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system is already available to T-Mobile customers through a free beta program. In July, the carrier plans on officially launching the service as “T-Satellite,” which will cost $10 per month for most consumers, including those on rival carriers. In contrast, AST has only launched five “BlueBird” satellites for its own system when it needs at least 45 to 60 to begin offering continuous service across the US and other markets. In addition, the company still has to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission before it can commercially offer the service to customers through key partners, including AT&T and Verizon. But in Monday’s earnings call, AST provided some details on how it plans to close the gap with SpaceX as both companies vie to provide satellite connectivity to cellular dead zones. In its presentation, the company said it plans on conducting five satellite launches over the next six to nine months. (The first launch, carrying a prototype next-generation BlueBird satellite, is scheduled for July though India's space agency.) In addition, AST anticipates “orbital launches every one to two months on average during 2025 and 2026," it said. The company is also on track to manufacture 40 second-generation BlueBird satellites for this year, "for over 50 satellites in total." However, AST executives declined to say how many satellites will be flown during each upcoming rocket launch. So the size of the initial constellation is unclear. That said, during the call, the company noted it only needs 25 satellites to start offering “non-continuous” service to users, meaning it can start generating revenue, but at the expense of coverage gaps. In other words, it looks like the company is betting it can operate around 25 satellites by the end of this year or early 2026. During the call, AST executives also said the company is paying more for its BlueBird satellites, partly because it's trying to move quickly to build the constellation. “The demand signals we are receiving is to get the service to market as fast as possible,” said AST President Scott Wisniewski. “So what you’re seeing is essentially a little bit of pull forward on launch, in a time when launch is harder to get, so we spent a little bit more than anticipated to get the timeline moving fast.” The other issue is that Trump’s tariffs are raising the costs for the raw materials to build the satellites. Each BlueBird satellite now costs up to $23 million to manufacture and launch, up from $19 million to $22 million. In a recent FCC filing, AST also noted its longer-term goal is operate 243 satellites by 2028. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Tesla (TSLA) shares surged Monday, pushing the company's market capitalization back above $1 trillion, amid a broad market rally after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. Shares of Tesla rose nearly 7% to close at $318.38 Monday, bringing the company's market cap to $1.02 trillion. That makes the Elon Musk-led automaker one of just nine American companies worth $1 trillion or more, along with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), and Broadcom (AVGO). Tesla's stock has climbed for three consecutive weeks, but the shares are still down more than 20% for 2025. The EV maker has faced a political backlash over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, with shares erasing much of their gains in the wake of President Donald Trump's election win. Last month, Musk said he would step back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency to spend more time with Tesla. Sales have lagged, including in China, where the company shipped fewer vehicles in April than it did a year earlier. Last month marked Tesla's seventh straight month of year-over-year declines in shipments from China, according to preliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association.

May 12, 2025 17:05 ET | Source: Village Farms International, Inc. Village Farms International, Inc. – Company to privatize certain assets of its Fresh Produce segment; enter supply agreements for retained assets – – Village Farms and private investment firms create privately held joint venture through transaction – – Village Farms’ Fresh segment to become cornerstone of NewCo’s commercial operations and growth strategy – – Village Farms expected to receive $40 million in cash proceeds; 37.9% equity ownership interest in NewCo – – VFF retains ownership of all Canadian cultivation assets; Marfa I and Monahans for future cannabis optionality – VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Village Farms International, Inc. (“Village Farms” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: VFF) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with a newly-formed holding company (“Vanguard Food LP” or “Vanguard”) backed by private investment firms including Sweat Equities, to privatize certain assets and operations of its Fresh Produce segment. The transaction will create a new, privately held joint venture with Village Farms as a minority owner, simultaneously enabling the Company to focus on its growing international business and repositioning its fresh produce business to flourish independently with new strategic capital partners. Village Farms’ Fresh Produce division will serve as the cornerstone of Vanguard’s commercial operations and growth strategy, transforming the business with supportive capital partners committed to executing a roll-up strategy of other leading North American produce brands and assets. Leveraging decades of Village Farms Fresh leadership in the cultivation, sales, marketing and distribution of produce to grocery stores and retailers, Vanguard will seek to expand its product categories and offerings for customers through M&A to create a premier branded CPG foods company supporting healthy lifestyles and sustainable farming practices. The parties have agreed to appoint Charlie Sweat, Founder of Sweat Equities, as Chairman of Vanguard’s Board of Managers. Mr. Sweat is the former Chief Executive Officer of Earthbound Farm, a leading organic foods company that transformed the organic salad category and grew from $10 million to over $540 million in annual sales during his 15-year tenure. Michael A. DeGiglio, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms, has also been appointed to Vanguard’s Board of Managers and will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer of Vanguard until a permanent replacement has been identified. Steve Ruffini, Chief Financial Officer of Village Farms, will also serve on Vanguard’s Board of Managers. Transaction Terms and Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, Village Farms will privatize its Texas-based, 40-acre Marfa II and 40-acre Fort Davis greenhouse assets, all of its produce-related intellectual property, with the exception of the Village Farms name, and transfer all of its produce distribution facilities, employees and operational control of these facilities to Vanguard. The transaction will be completed by way of a series of asset and lease transfers to Vanguard, and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025, following the satisfaction of closing conditions. Consideration paid to Village Farms in the transaction will include 37.9 percent of the initial common equity units of Vanguard, and $40 million in cash. Village Farms will have no future cash obligations to Vanguard, and pre-emptive rights to maintain its ownership interest. Vanguard will remain a private company with access to additional capital to execute a M&A roll-up strategy. Management Commentary Michael A. DeGiglio, Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms, commented, “I am pleased to announce this transformative transaction for Village Farms, and very proud to work with Charlie Sweat and the team at Sweat Equities to drastically improve long-term upside potential for our produce business. Charlie is a proven industry pioneer with an incredible track record building enterprises across the health and wellness food categories and creating value for shareholders. We believe this transaction will unlock tremendous long-term value for both our businesses, and are excited to gain committed new capital partners in produce and to focus more of our resources toward advancing our leadership position in global cannabis.” Charlie Sweat, Founder of Sweat Equities, commented, “I have admired the achievements of Michael and the Village Farms team in our industry for decades, and am thrilled to form this partnership which will leverage Village’s commercial expertise to create a new leader in the fresh produce industry in North America. Securing a proven operating team like Village Farms was a critical first step for Vanguard, and we believe the industry and macro-economic environments are ripe to begin executing a strategy to drive accretive growth through M&A. The timing of this joint venture aligns perfectly with shifting consumer behaviors, and we’re positioned well to meet increased demand for healthier alternatives to processed foods.” Michael A. DeGiglio concluded, “Village Farms is all in on the future of cannabis globally, and we’re excited to begin this next chapter. This transaction monetizes one-third of our greenhouse assets, positions our produce business to thrive as an independent private entity, and provides significant expansion potential for us to continue building our leadership position and reputation as one of the largest and most respected scaled cultivators and marketers of cannabis on the planet.” Additional Information Upon completion of the transaction, Village Farms will continue to own its 30-acre Monahans greenhouse facility in Texas, and will own and lease its 20-acre Marfa I greenhouse facility in Texas to Vanguard. The Marfa I facility is currently expandable to 40-acres and is adjacent to 950 acres of unoccupied land owned by Village Farms available for future expansion, retaining significant long-term optionality for potential future cannabis expansion in the United States. In Canada, Village Farms will continue to own and operate its 60-acre Delta 1 greenhouse, 25-acre Delta 2 greenhouse, and 25-acre Delta 3 greenhouse, each of which are located in Delta, British Columbia. Village Farms will enter into service and supply agreements with Vanguard for fresh produce production in Delta, which will continue supplying produce for Vanguard for a multi-year term. The Delta 1 greenhouse generated approximately $25 million in fresh produce sales in fiscal year 2024. Approvals and Advisors The proposed transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Village Farms International. FTI Capital Advisors, LLC acted as financial advisor to Village Farms in connection with the proposed transaction. Torys LLP acted as legal counsel to Village Farms. Houlihan Lokey acted as financial advisor, and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP acted as legal counsel to private investment firms including Sweat Equities. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. About Sweat Equities Sweat Equities is a private investment firm focused on investments in the health and wellness area with an emphasis on consumer goods in the food and beverage space. Sweat Equities is led by founder and managing principal, Charlie Sweat, and is made up of seven funds – a primary SE Fund LP with seven portfolio companies and six SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) totaling approximately $100 million of invested capital. The Sweat Equities model focuses on partnering with companies that can benefit beyond capital, leveraging the added value of the Sweat Equity team and its group of Advisors specializing in executive leadership, supply chain, operations/manufacturing, finance, sales and marketing, communications, and events. With the Village Farms partnership, Sweat Equities kicks off its Fund II capital raise, targeted at $300 million, focused on larger, mid-market companies versus the more emerging company markets in the first Funds. This initial Fund II investment carving out Village Farms fresh produce into a private entity, Vanguard Foods LLC, represents the first step in a fast and large M&A strategy to build a fresh foods platform bringing healthy, fresh foods to the market at scale. Sweat Equities will be reviewing various products and companies across many production methods when expanding the Vanguard platform. About Village Farms International Village Farms leverages decades of experience in Controlled Environment Agriculture as a large-scale, vertically-integrated supplier of high-value, high-growth plant-based Consumer Packaged Goods. The Company has a strong foundation as the leading and longest-tenured fresh produce supplier to grocery and large-format retailers throughout the US and Canada, but is now focused predominantly on leveraging its decades of agricultural expertise to focus on high-growth cannabinoid opportunities internationally. In Canada, the Company's wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Pure Sunfarms, is one of the single largest cannabis operations in the world (2.2 million square feet of greenhouse production), the lowest-cost producer and one of Canada’s best-selling brands. The Company has an incremental 2.6 million square feet of greenhouse capacity available in Canada for future expansion, and also owns 80% of Québec-based, Rose LifeScience, a leading third-party cannabis products commercialization expert in the Province of Québec. Internationally, Village Farms is targeting selected, nascent, legal cannabis opportunities with significant medium- and long-term potential. The Company exports medical cannabis from its EU GMP certified facility in Canada to a growing list of international markets including Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company is expanding its international presence with additional export contracts to new countries and customers across the globe, and is now making selective strategic investments in international assets. In Europe, wholly-owned Leli Holland has one of 10 licenses growing and distributing recreational cannabis products within the Dutch Coffee Shop Experiment. In the US, wholly-owned Balanced Health Botanicals is one of the leading CBD and hemp-derived brands and e-commerce platforms in the country. Subject to compliance with all applicable US federal and state laws and stock exchange rules, Village Farms plans to enter the US THC market via multiple strategies, leveraging its Texas-based greenhouse assets (5.5 million square feet of existing greenhouse capacity in West Texas), as well as the operational and product expertise gained through Pure Sunfarms' success in Canada. Village Farms Clean Energy (VFCE), through a partnership with Atlanta-based Terreva Renewables, creates renewable natural gas from landfill gas at its Delta RNG facility. VFCE receives royalties on all revenue generated. This partnership reduces Vancouver’s greenhouse gas emissions by 475,000 metric tons of CO2 per year, equivalent to removing more than 100,000 vehicles off the road or the energy use equivalent of powering 51,300 homes for one year.

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. Side hustles are no longer optional in today's economy. Many American full-time workers need ... More lucrative side gigs like these to keep up with rising costs. Gig jobs are not longer optional in today’s tight economy. Amid the rise of financial uncertainty and inflation, more people are turning to flexible online work, including freelancing, e-commerce and AI-powered content creation to keep up with skyrocketing costs. One reason side gigs are becoming the new normal is that workers are tired of the stress and uncertainty in a job that could end at any moment. Side gigs give you the autonomy to be the captain of your own ship, instead of a passenger whose fate is determined by big business that might not have your best interests at heart. Statistics show that 71% of Americans are searching for secondary income sources through side gigs. As prices soar and the new administration continues making cuts, the economy is tightening, and AI advances are causing massive layoffs. Here are five reasons you need a side gig in the 2025 job market: to increase your income, reduce financial stress, gain more opportunities, enjoy more flexibility and save time with job searches. I spoke with Avery Morgan, CHRO at EduBirdie, and she told me that extra money isn’t really extra anymore, that it’s a necessity for many of today’s workers. “For many Americans, side hustles aren’t optional in today's economy, they help them to keep up with rising costs, uncertainty, and evolving career priorities.” Morgan cites statistics showing that nearly 39% of employed adults already earn extra income, and another 17% plan to join them soon. she points out that for 41% of workers, that extra cash already goes to make ends meet. “And with Trump’s tariffs projected to cost the average household $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, low- and middle-income Americans could be hit much harder,” she asserts. A new survey from the global online tutoring platform Superprof reveals a growing shift in how Americans are approaching side gigs. One in three survey respondents said they’re willing to dedicate five-to–10 hours a week to online work. Respondents say the top five online money-making activities they’re involved in are taking online surveys, online investing, freelancing, selling on e-commerce platforms and testing websites and apps. You can find more high-paying side hustles, requiring no experience here. Morgan argues that, if you think side hustles aren’t worth it, you’re wrong. She notes that in 2024, the average gig job brought in $891 per month (that’s over $10K per year), with nearly 19% of people earning over $1,000. The best part, she underscores, is that many of the side gigs can fit into your schedule without overwhelming your day job. She lists four lucrative side gigs that can earn top dollar: “Good writing skills are still in demand, no matter what they say about AI,” Morgan insists. “The ability to break down complex ideas and make engaging, thoughtful content can easily turn into a lucrative side hustle.” She points out that many coaches, executives or creatives are looking for someone to help them with their writing, such as LinkedIn posts, podcast scripts or online course modules. She emphasizes that they need this assistance on a regular basis, willing to pay about $500-$2500 per month. “You don’t need many clients to get started,” Morgan notes. “Just offer your services to people you know, or email someone directly on LinkedIn. If you have strong writing skills, it’s a great way to earn extra income remotely. Plus, you'll get to learn from industry pros and build valuable connections.” Morgan points out that an empty garage, parking space, shed or even your backyard can all be turned into extra income. “On platforms like Neighbor, Spacer or Peerspace, it’s simple: take a couple of photos, list a price and place an ad. A garage or shed can be rented out to store other people’s stuff, it can bring $50 to $300 a month. And your backyard can get you $100-$1000 per booking, if you host photo shoots or small events. Another option is to rent out things you have lying around, such as power tools, marquees, barbecues, sports gear or musical instruments. Altogether, it can bring from $500 to $2000 per month.” “If you like plants, try growing simple succulents or cacti at home. They are unpretentious and do not require much care,” Morgan recommends. “After one to two months, you will have accumulated mature plants you can use to make sets like ‘a gift for a colleague’ or ‘greenery on the desktop.’ She suggests selling them on sites like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon Handmade. ”It takes about $50 for pots, soil, and the first plants to get started," she explains. “From there, all you need is a little time for plant care and sorting out the delivery. Selling three to five kits a week at $20 to $40, you can make $300 to $1,000 a month doing this in your free time.” Morgan mentions that you can earn money simply by sharing your opinions on buying goods, services you use or just your experience. “These sessions are held online, often via video and typically take 30 minutes to an hour,” she explains. “You can get $50 to $250 per participation.” She recommends that you try sites like User Interviews, Respondent.io and Prolific, which target working professionals, parents or niche audiences. “To get started, just sign up, fill out your profile and respond to offers,” she advises. “Even if you only participate in 2-3 surveys a month, that’s already $200-300.” SideHustles.com advises employers and job seekers to prepare for a potential hiring surge starting this month. May is the peak month for people to quit their jobs, with 27% of resignations each year happening during the month of May. If you’re tight for income, side gigs can help you get ahead and stay on your feet in this fast-changing, uncertain economy.

Title: U.S.-China Tariff Thaw Sparks Stock Rally—Making Bezos, Musk And Zuckerberg More Than $40 Billion Richer

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Stocks surged across the board Monday as the U.S. and China’s trade war deescalated significantly, and the most valuable American companies largely slumping from the Beijing vs. Washington standoff roared back to life. Stocks surged Monday after a "dream scenario" for bulls emerged out of this weekend's U.S.-China ... More talks. This weekend’s talks between Washington and Beijing officials in Geneva culminated in both countries cutting their tariff for at least the next 90 days, with the U.S. slashing its duties on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China cutting its levies on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. That led to a surge in global stocks as the most concrete evidence yet of Washington backing down from its most stark trade war plans, as the Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong-listed stocks soared 3% in Monday trading, with similar gains across U.S. indexes. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 2.8%, or 1,160 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 jumped 3.3% and tech-concentrated Nasdaq ripped forward 4.4%. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closed at their highest levels since March 26, March 3 and Feb. 28, respectively. Leading the charge were the tech behemoths perhaps most reliant on a symbiotic relationship with the U.S. and China, as shares of Amazon (up 8%), Apple (6%), Nvidia (5%) and Tesla (7%) all outperformed the broader market. Also rallying were the stocks of fellow “magnificent seven” constituents Alphabet (3%), Meta (8%) and Microsoft (2%). $830 billion. That’s about how much market capitalization the aforementioned seven tech giants added Monday, led by Apple, Amazon and Nvidia’s more than $150 billion respective surges. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company surpassed a $1 trillion valuation for the first time since late February during Monday’s rally. Tesla’s roughly $320 share price is still below its all-time high of nearly $490 set in December as investors flooded into the stock in anticipation of what Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration may mean for his company. Already the richest person in the world, Musk enjoyed an $11 billion bump to his net worth as Tesla shares rallied, extending his fortune to $407 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimates. The planet’s second-wealthiest person Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Earth’s third-richest person Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg enjoyed $14 billion and $16 billion respective net worth bumps, though both men are still more than $180 billion poorer than Musk. The U.S.-China deescalation was a “huge win for the bulls,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Monday note to clients, saying the dramatic lowering of tariffs was a “dream scenario” for the U.S. tech industry. As investors fled into riskier stocks, assets viewed as safe havens from the tariff-induced market slump struggled. Gold prices tumbled 3% to below $3,240 per troy ounce, the lowest level since April 10 and the largest single-day loss since November. Yields for 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes spiked by about 10 basis points apiece Monday, with the higher yields signifying less valuable bonds as the safe returns of Treasuries prove less appealing in a more friendly operating environment for public companies. The S&P is up almost 20% from its early April nadir, just ahead of President Donald Trump’s first tariff blink, but the U.S. equity yardstick is still down 3% since Trump’s January inauguration. Trump campaigned on raising tariffs and targeted Canada, China and Mexico with country-specific actions in his first two months, but the country-by-country tariffs he laid out during his April 2 “Liberation Day” event were far more hawkish than Wall Street anticipated. The S&P tanked 12% in the five trading sessions following that speech, which led to a chorus of economists warning the sudden, sharp rise in import costs could send the U.S. into an avoidable recession. Trump began to loosen his tariff belt April 9 when he paused much of the most severe duties for 90 days, though he didn’t show much leeway on Chinese levies until last week, when he floated an 80% tariff on Chinese goods, nearly three times as severe as the rate announced Monday. Apple, Nvidia and Tesla are among the American companies with the heaviest revenue exposure to China, which accounted for at least 17% of each of those companies’ 2024 sales, while Amazon relies on China as half of its third-party sellers originate from the country. Public companies mentioned “tariffs” on earnings calls this quarter more than twice as much as they did during any quarter in Trump’s first term, according to Morgan Stanley research, evidence of the more heightened concerns on bottom lines from this round of tariffs.

The iPhone 13 has so far missed out on Apple’s satellite features, such as Emergency SOS and Messages via Satellite. But a new iOS update opens the door for the company's older smartphones to receive satellite connectivity through their mobile carriers. With iOS 18.5, out today, all iPhone 13 models get "support for carrier-provided satellite features." Previously, the carrier-provided satellite connectivity was restricted to the iPhone 14 through 16 models. But Apple has since updated its support page to add the iPhone 13. The satellite connectivity can be useful if you end up in an area without traditional cell service. Instead, your phone can communicate through orbiting satellites, giving you a way to receive a signal even in a cellular dead zone. For US users, the iOS 18.5 update paves the way for iPhone 13 models to receive connectivity through T-Mobile’s cellular Starlink service with SpaceX, which is slated to launch in July. "Yes. Once iPhone 13 users upgrade to iOS 18.5, T-Satellite will be available to them," T-Mobile told PCMag, later adding: "Our teams are pushing an update out on our support page this week to reflect the iPhone 13 change (and Samsung Edge)." The cellular Starlink service will cost $10 per month and promises to offer SMS messages in cellular dead zones, before expanding to voice calls and data. Prior to July's launch, T-Mobile has been offering customers, including those on rival carriers, free access to the satellite system as part of a beta program. The so-called “T-satellite” service also supports the iPhone 14, 15 and 16, along with certain Android devices such as Pixel and Samsung phones. The same iOS update could help AT&T and Verizon bring their own satellite services to the iPhone 13. Both carriers are working with another company called AST SpaceMobile to develop a rival next-generation satellite service to counter the cellular Starlink system.

Title: Trump's push for lower drug prices is just asking Big Pharma to make less money

Pharma stocks rebounded and rose into the green Monday afternoon after details of President Donald Trump’s executive order on drug prices became public. The order does not include a legal mandate that pharmaceutical companies lower prices in the U.S., The New York Times (NYT+0.23%) reports. Instead, it asks pharma firms to voluntarily lower their prices. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) were up 2.4% Monday afternoon, after being down 2% earlier in the day. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) stock had climbed 2% by midday, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) stock gained 0.2%, and Novartis (NVS-0.56%) stock was about even on the day. Pfizer (PFE+1.72%) was up 3.1% and Merck (MRK-0.30%) gained 5.2%. Pharma stocks had fallen earlier Monday before the details of the executive order became known. The executive order said the Trump administration would consider taking regulatory actions or importing drugs from other nations if drugmakers don’t lower prices voluntarily, according to The Times. The order also called on federal agencies to look into why European countries get lower prices, and to attempt to get them to pay more. “I’m not knocking the drug companies,” Trump said before signing the order Monday. “I’m really more knocking the countries than the drug companies.” Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social late Sunday that the U.S. would pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price under a new “Most Favored Nations Policy.” He followed that up with a post Monday saying drug prices would fall by 59%, though he did not specify how he arrived at that number. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a similar measure in his first term that would have applied to about 50 popular drugs covered by Medicare. The plan was blocked by a federal court that ruled the administration had taken shortcuts in the policymaking process.

Pharma companies were mostly left out of the stock market’s broader rally Monday morning on the news that President Donald Trump would sign an order lowering some drug prices. A surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China on Monday morning sent stocks soaring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all up 2.5% or more in the first 30 minutes of trading. But pharmaceutical stocks weren’t invited to the party, after Trump said Sunday night that he would sign an executive order lowering drug prices in the United States. Trump signed the order Monday morning. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) were down 2% Monday morning, even after a new study found the company’s weight loss drug, Zepbound, beat Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy in a head-to-head trial. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) was down 1.9% Monday morning. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) was down 0.4%, while Novartis (NVS-0.56%) was down 0.5%. Pfizer (PFE+1.72%) was a rare pharma bright spot, up 2.2%. “Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!” Trump posted to his Truth Social app on Sunday night. The president wrote that under a new “Most Favored Nations Policy,” the U.S. would pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price. He said he would sign the executive order on Monday. Trump followed that up with a post Monday morning claiming that drug prices would be reduced by 59%, though he didn’t specify how he arrived at that number. Americans often pay much higher prices for drugs than people in other nations. A committee found last year that the net cost of Ozempic, for example, was $600 per month in the U.S., compared to $92 in the U.K. and $59 in Germany.

Title: Eli Lilly's Zepbound beat Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy in a big weight loss drug study

Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.74%) and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.61%) weight loss drugs went head-to-head in a weight loss study for the first time — and Eli Lilly’s drug came out on top. Participants who took Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, which is sold as Zepbound, lost 50 pounds on average, while those using Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide, also known as Wegovy, lost an average of 33 pounds. The study was funded by Eli Lilly and published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial included 751 participants, all Americans who were considered overweight or obese and had at least one other weight-related health issue. They received weekly injections of the highest tolerated dose of either drug. The participants who took Zepbound lost an average of about 20% of their body weight at the end of the 72-week trial, while those who took Wegovy lost about 14% of theirs. About 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy. “These data confirm Zepbound as a leading treatment option for people living with obesity and equip healthcare providers with critical insights to make well-informed treatment decisions as part of a comprehensive obesity care plan,” Leonard Glass, Eli Lilly’s senior vice president of global medical affairs, said in a statement. Eli Lilly stock fell about 1% in Monday morning trading, after President Donald Trump signaled plans Sunday for an executive order aimed at lower prescription drug prices. Novo Nordisk stock was down about 0.4%. Participants in both groups had improvements in health factors like blood pressure, blood fat, and blood sugar levels as they lost weight. Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly had released top-line results of the study back in December, before they were peer-reviewed. This was the first time the study was published in full. The rise of GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, has been a major boost for Lilly and Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, making them the most valuable pharma companies in the world. A number of cheaper, compounded versions have also made it to market, though the FDA has begun cracking down on them since the drugs are no longer considered to be in shortage. —William Gavin contributed to this article.

Title: Christy Anderson Picks Palantir And Wins 2024-2025 Derby

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, speaking in April in Washington DC. Photo by Kevin ... More Dietsch/Getty Images. A 446% gain in Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) propelled Christy Anderson to a victory in the 2024-2025 running of Dorfman’s Three-Stock Derby, an annual stock-picking contest. Anderson, a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, is chief operating officer for a small company that makes radio frequency amplifiers with military applications. As such, she became familiar with Palantir, an analytical software company whose Gotham platform is used by the U.S. military and Western-allied nations. Her company doesn’t do business with Palantir, and she doesn’t own the stock. In fact, Anderson doesn’t own any stocks. “The stock market to me is just gambling,” she says. “I’m very intrigued by it though. I look at stocks every day.” Anderson also picked Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), a Danish pharmaceutical company, and Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE), which mines digital currencies. Both suffered losses, but her gain on Palantir was so huge that she ended with a 121% combined return, easily capturing first place. Palantir is “probably overpriced now,” Anderson says. “They don’t really have the revenue to justify their market price.” When she entered the contest, she wrote that ”the number of military hotspots continues to grow,” and that the military “will need an increasing number of unmanned assets.” Anderson expects that the stock market will be volatile in the coming year, and will be little changed a year from now, after a lot of ups and downs. Donny Sanders, an accountant in Worcester, Massachusetts, took second place with an 82% gain. All three of his selections rose, led by Strategy (MSTR) with a 149% advance. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) chipped in a 58% gain, while iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) gained 39%. Of the three stocks, Sanders actually holds only one, Tesla. He doesn’t own a Tesla car, but “might get one eventually,” he says. He regards the car as “a super piece of technology.” Sanders doesn’t have a strong guess as to what the market will do in the coming year. “Hold for the long term, that’s my motto,” he says. Ronald Robinson, a retiree in Pahrump, Nevada, took third place with a 48% combined gain on his three choices. Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) led the way, with a 107% gain. Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) returned 25% and Energy Transfer LP (ET) 11%. Robinson formerly worked for a transportation company in Alaska. He invests in stocks “just for kind of fun,” he says. Robinson is optimistic about the market for the coming year. Lately, he says, the market has been “based on negative news. If the negative news can simmer down, I think the market will be good.” He thinks the U.S. and China will probably reach “some kind of agreement” on trade. Of 34 contestants, three saw all three of their picks go up. They were Sanders, Robinson, and Larry Weiner, a real estate agent in Las Vegas. Eighteen contestants notched positive returns, and 16 showed a loss. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index was up 6.8% for the contest period. You are welcome to enter the next running of Dorfman’s Three-Stock Derby. This will be the 18th stock-picking contest I have run, and the ninth in which contestants have to pick three stocks, not just one. To enter, send me: Email me your entry at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com. Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110. Entries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 31, 2025. The contest period will be from the market close on that date through the close on April 30, 2026. If you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are important. You do not need to own the stocks you select, but it’s fine if you do. Stocks must be traded in the U.S., but need not necessarily be U.S. companies. Short sales are permitted but not encouraged, since I have a separate short-selling contest. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are permitted. There’s no fee to enter. The winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of her or his choice. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients.

Shares of tech firms surged in early trading Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily slash tariffs while they work out a long term deal. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks—Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN)—advanced along with global indexes on the de-escalation of the trade war with China. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) was up 4% shortly after the markets opened. Shares of chipmakers Marvell Technologies (MRVL), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) also rose sharply. Tech stocks had gotten hammered after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement in early April prompted one of the worst stock sell-offs in decades, with Apple shares losing 16% of their value in their worst 2-day stretch since September 2008. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: The Dow surges 1,000 points and the Nasdaq soars 4% as the U.S. and China call a trade war truce

U.S. stocks soared Monday after Washington and Beijing struck a surprise deal to dramatically cut tariffs, marking a rare moment of clarity and good news in an otherwise volatile environment. The agreement, announced early Monday after weekend talks in Switzerland, includes a 90-day pause on new tariffs and sharp rollbacks on existing duties — moves that sent stocks skyrocketing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 1,160 points, or 2.8%. The S&P 500 rose almost 3.3%, and the Nasdaq soared about 4.4% as tech stocks led the market relief rally. One analyst called the tariffs deal a “dream scenario” for tech. Under the truce, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will fall from 145% to 30%, while China will cut duties on American goods from 125% to 10%, both for an initial 90-day window. The rollback is far more aggressive than many expected and signals what negotiators described as “substantial progress” toward a longer-term resolution. For markets, it’s a welcome reprieve from geopolitical brinkmanship. As Monday’s market movement made clear, the deal is functioning as a pressure release for investor fears, not to mention a global supply chain that’s been creaking and grinding under the strain. The sharp rally in major indexes further reflected that pivot, with the Nasdaq leading the charge and tech stocks in particular benefitting from easing supply chain constraints. The Magnificent 7 tech stocks rallied, with Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) up 8.1%, Apple (AAPL-0.39%) adding 6.3%, Nvidia up 5.4%, and Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) rising 6.8%. Wedbush analysts called the deal a “huge win for the market and bulls,” noting that the cuts likely take a near-term U.S. recession “off the table.” Analysts at the firm now expect the focus to shift from the economic doom-and-gloom of the past six weeks toward a more normalized growth outlook. Other analysts questioned the point of all the upheaval. Either way, the path forward is not entirely clear. Major issues remain unresolved, particularly restrictions around advanced chips and AI hardware, including Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) H20 chips. But for now, the tariff thaw marks a major inflection point. Investors will have plenty more to chew on this week, with a host of economic indicators set to land and the last major earnings report of the first quarter set to hit as well. Walmart (WMT+0.77%) results are due Thursday and should provide an inside look at consumer sentiment, especially among hard-pressed American households.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2025/05/02: Meta logo is seen at their stall during the World Audio ... More Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES) event in Mumbai. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Following positive developments in U.S.-China trade negotiations, Meta stock (NASDAQ:META) is trending upward, showing a 7% gain in pre-market trading. This surge is likely driven by the announcement that both nations have agreed to a 90-day pause on tariff increases and a significant reduction in existing tariff levels. Specifically, reciprocal tariffs are set to decrease by 115%, from the current 125% to 10%. Previously, investors had expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on Meta Platforms. Meta's business model necessitates significant infrastructure scaling to support its algorithms, power Reels, and advance its growing AI capabilities. Higher tariffs would have increased the cost of this infrastructure development. Coupled with anxieties regarding a possible pullback in advertising spending, this created a worrisome outlook for the company. However, the newly announced 90-day tariff pause is being viewed favorably by investors, alleviating some of these immediate concerns. Furthermore, the substantial tariff reduction signals a potential breakthrough in trade discussions, indicating a shared desire to ease trade tensions. Market attention will now turn to whether this development signifies the start of a more comprehensive and lasting trade agreement. Also, see – Is The U.S.-China Trade War Over? Beyond these macroeconomic factors, META stock appears to be an attractive investment at its current pre-market price of approximately $630. We believe that the concerns surrounding META stock are currently minimal, making its high valuation justified. Our positive assessment is based on a comparison of META's present valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that Meta Platforms exhibits very strong operating performance and a robust financial condition, as will be detailed subsequently. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Will AI Really Disrupt Google’s Search Empire? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms’ Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms' profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has seen an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: META stock demonstrated strong performance across the key parameters we analyzed. While its valuation of 9.7x trailing revenues is on the higher end, this appears justified by its accelerating sales growth and improving profitability. In light of these strong fundamentals, and now considering the positive momentum generated by the U.S.-China trade talk developments and the 90-day tariff pause, we believe that META stock still presents a compelling buying opportunity for substantial long-term gains. While META stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Can Google Ads' built-in AI tool compete with third-party solutions for ad creation? See which delivers better ad copy, images, and video. Every day, marketing teams face a crucial decision: Should they rely on Google’s built-in AI tools or invest in custom solutions for specific ad campaign tasks? I’ve watched this debate play out countless times with clients. Google continues adding more AI features for tasks like ad copy generation, headline creation, image generation, and product feed optimization. Meanwhile, specialized tools and custom solutions are thriving, and no real breakthrough for Google AI can be seen. Recent research supports this tension. Gherheș et al. (2025) found that while AI-generated content can outperform human-created alternatives in certain contexts, the quality varies significantly depending on implementation and purpose. Their study revealed that over 50% of users preferred AI-generated informative content over sensationalized approaches, suggesting that how AI is deployed matters more than the technology itself. But which approach actually delivers better results? And at what cost? As Pavlik (2024) notes in his analysis of AI in journalism, tools like ChatGPT don’t simply replace human creativity but rather present opportunities for “improving the quality and effectiveness” of creative work when properly integrated into existing workflows. A recent study by Ameet Khabra compared the performance of human-written versus AI-generated ad copy in Google Ads campaigns. Over an eight-week period with a $500 budget, human-crafted ads significantly outperformed AI-created content from Copy AI, achieving 60% more clicks, a 1.33% higher click-through rate, and a lower cost per click ($4.85 vs. $6.05). Researchers attributed human copywriters’ superior performance to their ability to understand audience emotions, employ creativity and emotional appeal, adapt to specific contexts, and leverage cultural nuances that AI still struggles to replicate. While acknowledging AI’s evolving capabilities and potential value as a supplementary tool, the study emphasizes the enduring importance of human creativity in crafting compelling advertising messages that drive engagement and conversions. Regardless of these mixed research findings, one thing is certain: AI is increasingly embedded in creative processes across marketing, and its integration is inevitable. The question isn’t whether AI will play a role in advertising creation, but rather how marketers can best leverage these tools to enhance their campaigns. As AI capabilities evolve rapidly, today’s limitations may be tomorrow’s strengths. With this inevitability in mind, marketers need practical guidance on navigating the current landscape of available solutions. This article compares Google Ads integrated AI tools against third-party and custom solutions for creative and optimization tasks specifically. Google’s AI text generator aims to streamline the ad creation process by converting basic product descriptions into campaign-ready assets. The platform encourages advertisers to input unique selling propositions and key product features to generate contextually relevant ad copy. Upon testing this tool with a simulated video game business specializing in refurbished PlayStation 5 consoles and games, the performance fell notably short of expectations. The output quality was inconsistent, but more concerning were the significant compliance issues observed. In one particularly problematic instance, the system generated the phrase “Welcome to the Amazon® Website” as suggested ad text, presenting a clear trademark infringement risk and potential legal exposure for advertisers. Such critical errors highlight a fundamental limitation in Google’s native AI solution: While offering workflow convenience, it demonstrates inadequate safeguards for brand compliance and legal protection. The system also produced contextually inappropriate messaging, such as “PlayStation 5 Problems Solved,” which misaligned with sales-oriented campaign objectives by suggesting repair services or technical support rather than product offerings. Without careful human review, these problems make the tool risky to use, especially for businesses in competitive markets where mistaken identity or inaccurate representations could lead to serious legal issues and damage to your reputation. When generating longer headlines, there were much fewer results. Only three ad suggestions appeared, one of which included free shipping information for orders over $50, which was a hallucination, as this information was never disclosed in the prompt or the landing page. Creating descriptions was even worse, as there was only one ad suggestion and not even a good one from a copywriting perspective. After trying with different prompts, I was able to get at least five new descriptions out of Google AI. Still, the results were quite disappointing. The ad copy contained hallucinations like the “free shipping over 100 USD,” as well as the business name “Example Video Games,” instead of using the business name of the account or extracting it from the landing page or URL. Overall, underwhelming results, considering Google is one of the biggest companies on earth and owns the biggest online advertising platform. While Google’s AI text generator struggles with brand accuracy and contextual relevance, several general-purpose AI models offer more sophisticated ad copy creation capabilities that balance automation with quality control. Leading general AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini represent compelling alternatives for marketers seeking higher-quality ad copy generation. Unlike Google’s more constrained system, these platforms offer greater flexibility in handling nuanced prompting and brand-specific requirements. In testing with our video game business scenario, we prompted each model to create headlines for refurbished PlayStation 5 consoles. The results demonstrated significant advantages over Google’s native offering: All three models demonstrated superior context awareness compared to Google’s native tool, with each showcasing different strategic approaches to headline creation. They successfully avoided the hallucinations and brand confusion issues observed in Google’s Ad tool, while providing greater headline variety tailored to different marketing objectives. The key advantage these general AI assistants offer is their adaptability and more refined understanding of marketing language. By providing detailed prompting with brand guidelines, target audience information, and specific messaging requirements, marketers can achieve significantly better results than with Google’s more limited integrated tool. For businesses where ad copy directly impacts conversion rates, leveraging these more sophisticated AI options can yield higher-quality creative assets that better represent brand positioning and speak more effectively to customer needs. Despite Gemini’s relevant headline ideas, it struggled to adhere to the 30-character limit for some prompts on Google Ads headlines – a surprising limitation given that Gemini is Google’s own AI model and would be expected to understand Google Ads guidelines inherently – while Claude and ChatGPT consistently produced properly sized headlines without major additional editing or truncation. Image generation is another area where AI can really shine and reduce the workload. Images are a core asset in ecommerce, not only used for product images, but also for category pages, shop banners, display ads, and more. For our virtual video game business, I tried to create some images matching our PlayStation 5 asset group. The results were interesting to say. The first created image looks very similar to an Xbox. Specifically, an Xbox One S or an Xbox Series S, which is the latest model. Now, there are no logos or trademarks seen, and the form factor is a little off. Even more interesting, depending on the exact prompt, Google AI shows an error message related to branded items and content restrictions. Another image created looks a little more like a PlayStation, but not as described and advertised as a PlayStation 5, but rather an older PlayStation 4 model. Again, the content restrictions are most likely responsible for the results. While the image results are somewhat disappointing for those branded items, it is understandable that Google AI follows content restrictions and brand guidelines to avoid any legal issues, as the PlayStation is a trademark of Sony, and the Xbox is a trademark of Microsoft. It’s interesting to see that Google AI tries to work around this limitation and still creates an image, but in that specific case, the image is more or less useless, as there is little value in showcasing a non-existent video game console. A question here would be why the content restrictions and guidelines did not apply to text creation when the text asset “Welcome to the Amazon® Website” was created. To check the image creation quality, I tried a different approach for non-branded items in the dog food category. The image is good at first glance since multiple products are shown with a dog in the picture, supporting the category, but some things are off. The text in the image is still a mess for Google AI. Plus, the proportions are wrong. The dog is way too small, considering the cans of dog food displayed, which are small items. Better than video game consoles, but still not good enough to rely solely on Google AI without any backup or alternative. Using the same prompts to create images, ChatGPT delivers amazing results compared to the Google Ads integrated image creator. Visually, it was able to recreate a PlayStation video game console with a gaming controller. ChatGPT even got details right, except the brand logo, which might be due to some brand protection measures. Also, the latest Xbox model was created with in-depth details. This time, even the Xbox logo was created, maybe because ChatGPT and Microsoft have made a trademark deal of some sort? Or trademark restrictions have some loopholes. At last, the creation of the dog food image was also a success. The prompt included the brand to be named “Doug’s Best Dog Food,” which was perfectly written on the product, along with a nicely placed bowl full of pellets in front of a golden retriever. In comparison, Google AI was able to create a decent image, but upon closer look, issues with displaying words were apparent, which ChatGPT could handle perfectly. Qwen is an image generation tool based on Deepseek, which is a Chinese-based AI developer. The image from Qwen clearly had an “AI” look compared to the ChatGPT or Google AI image. However, it got the brand name “Doug’s Best Dog Food” right. With some improvements, Qwen can produce decent images, if you are okay with having a digital image look. Google AI was able to create a more real-life looking image, with the downside of not being able to display the brand name correctly. Google’s built-in video creation tool aims to make video advertising accessible to marketers without production resources. The tool covers multiple marketing objectives – from brand awareness and consideration to direct sales and app promotion – accommodating various business categories, including apps, products, and services. It offers flexibility with vertical, square, and horizontal formats in lengths ranging from quick six-second spots to 15-second and longer videos. However, the tool’s output quality reveals its limitations. Most videos are essentially slideshows, stitching together static images, logos, and text overlays rather than fluid video content. While this approach democratizes video ad creation, the results often lack the polish and engagement power of properly produced video content. For many marketers, this represents the fundamental tradeoff of Google’s native tools: accessibility and integration vs. creative limitations that might impact performance. At best, marketers get a nice-looking slideshow; speaking of a serious advertising video would be too much. The better templates are mostly for app-related videos, where at least some kind of animation is included with a finger doing some phone touch gestures. Overall, the native video creation tool serves as a backup for marketers who need a video immediately and don’t have any tools on hand. In any other case, it’s best to postpone video creation and start with a more decent tool. Canva makes much better videos than Google Ads’ built-in tools with almost the same effort. Google mostly creates basic slideshows, but Canva gives you thousands of professional templates, animations, and stock videos to use in your marketing. The simple drag-and-drop design lets you make engaging videos with smooth transitions and text effects that keep viewers engaged. Unlike Google’s static slideshows, Canva creates flowing video content that looks professionally made. If you spend just a few more minutes using Canva instead of Google’s tool, your videos will look much more professional and likely perform better with your audience. Alibaba’s Qwen is a strong competitor to Google Ads’ basic video tools, giving marketers better videos without needing special skills. While Google just makes simple slideshows, Qwen uses AI to turn your images and text into dynamic videos with smooth movements and professional transitions. The tool is great at automatically creating cohesive visual stories even from minimal input, adding motion to still images in ways that look professional. What stands out is how Qwen creates animations that actually match your product type and brand style, avoiding the one-size-fits-all look of Google’s templates. Though not as well-known as Canva in the West, Qwen’s AI approach produces polished videos that look intentionally designed rather than template-made, making it a great choice for marketers who want better videos than what Google offers. For the example of a dog food brand, Qwen delivered exceptional results. With the first prompt, Qwen created a five-second clip of golden retrievers playing around and going to a human hand to eat dog food from the hand. Not only did the video look pretty close to real life compared to the Qwen image generation “AI look,” but Qwen also did this as a free tool. No cost involved. If you compare this to the Google video creation, which is basically a PowerPoint presentation, Qwen makes a really good performance. Another great video tool is Sora from OpenAI. Since Sora is included in the $20 Premium membership, you can generate videos at almost no cost, though with some limitations on video quality and length. Still, there are a few tools out there that can generate decent AI video output for that cost. The Product Studio for Merchant Center Next is a beta image optimization tool within the Merchant Center, also accessible via the Google App within Shopify. It allows for creating product images in various scenes, as well as removing backgrounds and increasing image quality. These are two tries to display a gaming controller in a scene. Although the quality of the product image has remained reasonably good, the scenes are barely usable. The image processing prompt was “Showcase this controller in a living room, in front of a TV with neon lighting.” In practice, the desired scene was not even remotely depicted. The controller in front of notebooks or pens is out of place; the second attempt resulted in three black backgrounds and a fiery background. Unlike Google’s Product Studio, which struggles with accurate scene generation as shown in the gaming controller example, several free tools offer more reliable image optimization capabilities. Canva’s free tier includes a background removal tool that produces clean cutouts with remarkable accuracy. While scene creation is more limited in the free version, you can still place products on various pre-designed backgrounds or use their extensive template library to create more contextually appropriate product displays than what you experienced with Google’s tool. To remove backgrounds, use remove.bg, which is a specialized tool that focuses exclusively on background removal with impressive results, even for complex products like your gaming controller. The free version has size limitations but delivers professional-quality cutouts that can then be placed into scenes using other tools. For everything more complex, GIMP is a free and capable tool. This open-source image editor provides robust capabilities for both background removal and scene composition. Though it has a steeper learning curve, GIMP offers precise control over image quality enhancement and realistic product placement. Google’s native AI tools, while conveniently integrated into their advertising platform, consistently underperform compared to third-party alternatives. The evidence is clear and concerning. Google’s AI ad copy generator produced legally problematic content with brand infringement risks and hallucinated product details. Its image generation produced visually inaccurate representations. The video creation tool delivered little more than basic slideshows rather than engaging video content. Meanwhile, third-party solutions or Google’s own Gemini model used externally demonstrated superior capabilities across all creative functions: This performance gap reveals the fundamental tradeoff marketers face: convenience of integration vs. creative quality and performance. Google’s in-platform AI tools provide workflow efficiency but at the significant cost of creative limitations, brand safety concerns, and potential legal exposure. For marketers serious about campaign performance, the path forward is clear: Leverage external AI solutions for creative development, then import these higher-quality assets into Google’s advertising platform. This hybrid approach maintains the advantage of Google’s targeting and delivery mechanisms while avoiding the substantial limitations of their creative AI tools. As AI continues to evolve in marketing, successful advertisers will be those who strategically select the right tools for each specific function rather than defaulting to in-platform options for convenience alone. The evidence suggests that, for now, the marketing advantage lies decidedly with those willing to look beyond Google’s native AI for their creative development needs.

Title: Dow soars 1,100 points after Trump team and China dramatically lower tariffs | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession. The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month. “The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.” The Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.) It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year. US stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports. In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant. Both sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors. “No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.” Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us. Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.” “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.” The de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning. “The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.” As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel. By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month. “The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth. Tech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%. Stocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%. Automakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%. “The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.” Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful. “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.” Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war. “I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese. Bessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however. “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.” Related article How Trump managed to get his much-needed China trade victory As the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel. “What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.” He also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries. The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China. “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.” But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy. “The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession. The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month. “The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.” The Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.) It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year. US stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports. In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant. Both sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors. “No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.” Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us. Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.” “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.” The de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning. “The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.” As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel. By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month. “The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth. Tech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%. Stocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%. Automakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%. “The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.” Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful. “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.” Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war. “I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese.

Title: Gold Bars Rapidly Sell Out at Costco, Forcing Retail Giant To Slap New Purchase Restrictions on Customers: Report

A sudden rush in demand for gold is reportedly forcing retail giant Costco (COST) to put restrictions on how much customers can buy at a time. Costco’s 24-karat gold bars, which debuted in June of 2023, have seen historic demand amid all-time high prices and inflation concerns, reports Bloomberg. A survey from Bloomberg estimated that about 77% of Costco locations across the US that sell bullion bars were out of stock by the first week of October 2024, even after receiving fresh stocks in the previous weeks. Since then, the price of gold has gone much higher, currently trading at $3,248 after hitting an all-time high of $3,500. Now, Costco’s checkout page for its gold bars states, “Limit of one Transaction Per Membership, with a Maximum of two Units Per 24 Hours.” In April of last year, banking giant Wells Fargo estimated that Costco was seeing as much as $200 million per month in revenue from its gold bar sales alone. Said Wells Fargo equity analyst Edward Kelly at the time, “Our work suggests there has been significant interest given COST’s aggressive pricing and high level of customer trust… The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and COST’s robust monthly eComm sales suggest a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch.” In addition to gold, Costco is also selling silver and platinum bars to its customers.

Automakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%. “The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.” Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful. “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.” Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war. “I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese. Bessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however. “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.” Related article How Trump managed to get his much-needed China trade victory As the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel. “What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.” He also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries. The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China. “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.” But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy. “The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Buyers to weigh the flexibility of digital with the Upfront’s legacy scale

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → NewFronts week is done, and the video ad marketplace is about to hear from the veteran TV sellers of linear, cable and streaming — with YouTube pushing itself right into the middle of proceedings. Could 2025 be the year that ad dollars shift in greater volume from the linear broadcast and cable networks to the more investment-flexible, cost-efficient and consumer-friendly digital video environment showcased all last week? Several major publishers and the IAB last week presented their content wares and new ad units, while playing up brand safety as well. According to two of four media buyers Digiday spoke with, LinkedIn, of all Newfronts players, surprised the most with its presentation. First-time NewFronts presenter LinkedIn “went more tactile and opportunistic, and data- and AI-focused vs. ‘here’s our big, splashy new content program,’” said Angela Dahir, vp of strategy & media planning at Jellyfish. “It was more tactile functionality for us that we could then take to our clients who are in that B2B space, which we have a lot of … There’s a lot of unearthed opportunity in LinkedIn.” Another media buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that LinkedIn stood out, but even for reasons beyond B2B opportunities. “What was impressive about what they shared was just the narrative on how video on their platform is something that really impacts business decision makers,” said the buyer, who was also impressed by LinkedIn’s ability to offer data both on- and off-platform. “Business influencers, are really aiding in that, now that brands can kind of get involved with those business creators in a new way.” But it’s the more flexible investment opportunities that could sway some marketers and their media agencies to spend among NewFronts publishers rather than the classic TV providers — certainly at a time of great economic uncertainty (tariffs, interest rates, flagging consumer sentiment stats, unpredictable government policies, etc). “I think the benefits of cost efficiencies outweigh some of that upfront commitment and the pricing — the larger monetary commitment,” said Lindsey Freed, svp of media investment at Basis Technologies. “With more CTV streaming [and] programmatic buying, we’re seeing the rate efficiencies and the ability to target in very similar ways — it’s what the buzz is all about … The flexibility of being able to execute across that media, rather than committing a large dollar amount upfront is really where we’re going to see the shift.” “There’s a lot of evaluation going on of media spend,” said Tucker Matheson, CEO of Markacy, who said none of his clients are actually cutting budgets — yet. “Brands in a budget pinch are … really just trying to figure out where’s my biggest bang for my buck.” To Matheson, the answer lies in applying incrementality testing to guide them to the right investment. But there are also a number of new ad-unit opportunities being rolled out by some of the NewFronts presenters, as a means of attracting more ad dollars from brands of all size — some of which caught the eye of buyers. Some of the OEM providers like LG and Vizio showed off units including: “As media buyers, we’re really going to have to think about these new [habits], thinking of the consumer, what they’re doing, and tying our buys together to allow for that ease of shopping on our phone or shopping while we’re watching TV,” Basis Technologies’ Freed said. “CTV, for sure, offers a lot more of that potential to do more complex or interactive ad formats, whether it’s shoppable or just general formats than what you can do on linear,” said Chris Rigas, vp of media at Markacy. “There’s definitely an appeal to that. It’s obviously clear that CTV is going to continue gaining market share.” Of course, the linear companies also offer some of these innovations too, which can’t be forgotten — just like they offer the lion’s share of sports content. But again, the buyers Digiday spoke with said sports is clearly no longer the exclusive territory of the linear giants like NBC U or Disney. With Amazon, Tubi, Hulu and others now offering professional league sports content, it’s a more even playing field than ever. “This one has live sports and that one has live sports, and everyone’s getting connected through the pipeline,” said Jellyfish’s Dahir. “The digital marketplace is becoming now the crux of opportunity, because we have so much more access and more clients that are able to play in this video space that maybe we’re not able to in the past.” For better or worse, that diaspora of sports content raises its own set of problems for media buyers and planners. “If I’m watching [sports] on Peacock, but through my Chromecast, I get a different ad,” noted Dahir. “This creates a very fragmented landscape for live sports … I’m curious to see if there will eventually be a step backward. Because, yes, it gives us more opportunity of getting more efficient and effective buys in live sports, especially for smaller clients and that need for efficiency. But from a rating standpoint, I wonder if there will eventually be a pushback … because there’s too many touch points that you can tag it.” And that’s where programmatic steps in with both the offer of promise and potential for confusion. Much like three years ago, when CTV content became more available through programmatic investment, it ushered in the chance for smaller advertisers to get into TV advertising. But it also made a mess of not knowing who repped what inventory. That could happen with sports content today. Because the fact is, there’s a bottom-line shift that is taking place across the entire video landscape: the continued increase of programmatic investment vs. direct buying. “One theme that hit for me at the NewFronts was that personalized is premium and it’s more about the curation of content and context,” said the buyer on background. “It’s making sure that your ads are appearing within the content you wanted to appear with the audience targeting that you need. Programmatic makes that more easily possible and the workflow is way easier — when done right.” Added Basis Technologies’ Freed: “For buyers, it’s easier because we have more control — we are able to shift budgets between deal IDs easier than we can direct buys.” Amazon may be one the fastest growing powerhouses in major media, rivaling Google and Meta for supremacy — but it does have one problem. It seems more consumers are looking into how to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions than any other streamer, according to a study by Sparrow, which helps consumers get money from class-action suits. Here’s the data (although it must be noted, the below stats are of people searching for how to cancel, not actual cancellations): “It’s just changing the logo on the slide and saying, ‘I’m going to aggregate, and centralize all my media spend.’ And they’re going to lean heavier into principal media buying, and this allows them to make it easier for them to do that.” In this edition of the Digiday+ Research Briefing, we examine the impact of tariffs on consumers, retailers and advertisers. As uncertainty remains, we look at some different predictions and their impacts. The software giant is contacting media buyers informing them it will close in February 2026.

PL Capital – Prabhudas Lilladher Group’s Alternative Investment Management company has launched its first Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) – the PL Capital Performing Credit Fund, a Category II AIF. Renisha Chainani, Head-Research at Augmont writes - After the Federal Reserve reaffirmed that it is not in a rush to cut interest rates since the U.S. economy is still relatively steady and inflation concerns are still high, gold’s price action last week was comparatively neutral. In recent weeks, the Greenback has recovered after dropping almost 9% from its March peak and momentarily falling below 98 last month. The US-China trade rhetoric has been cooling, which has been a major factor in the recovery. This weekend’s meeting between US and Chinese officials in Switzerland could have immediate effects. The United States and China declared “significant progress” following two days of negotiations in Switzerland to defuse a trade war. A trade deal with China was reached after two days of talks in Geneva, according to top Trump administration officials. This might be a huge win for President Donald Trump in his trade war with Beijing. Trump indicated a readiness to reduce U.S. tariffs on China to 80% going into the weekend trade talks, but it was unclear at first if either side would agree to decrease taxes on the other. Trade discussions with US officials are “an important first step” in stabilising bilateral trade relations, according to China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng. The two parties also achieved “substantial progress,” according to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, traders will watch the contents of the US-China trade discussions, which the US will provide on Monday. In April, the People’s Bank of China increased its gold stockpiles by 2 tonnes for the sixth consecutive month, according to the World Gold Council. While the Czech National Bank’s reserves rose by 2.5 tonnes in April, the National Bank of Poland’s (NBP) holdings jumped by 12 tonnes to 509 tonnes. The sellers would be able to regain control, at least temporarily, if tensions were to decrease or some tariffs were to be lowered. Additionally, the fact that gains have now paused twice in the mid-$3400 (~Rs 97000) range suggests that the rally may be nearing its short-term exhaustion. Gold prices may drop to $3200 (~Rs 92000) if they remain below $3365 (~Rs 94000) this week. And we are expected to see a $200 decline from those levels up to $3000 (~Rs 86000) if prices break and hold below $3200, which is the Double Top formation’s neckline support. Credifin Limited (earlier PHF Leasing Limited), a Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India listed, NBFC, headquartered in Jalandhar with its Corporate Office in Delhi-NCR, announced the launch of its new product: EV Startup Loans. This product will promote entrepreneurship through EV business and deployment of active vehicles throughout the country.

We prefer Data Patterns, BEL, Mazagon Dock, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Zen Tech, Paras Defence and HAL. ➡️ Opportunity in Adversity: In the on-going India vs. Pakistan Conflict, India has been showcasing its defence capabilities by standing strong against Chinese systems used by Pakistan. We believe that this demonstration will open gates in terms of export opportunities for India ➡️ Operation Sindoor delivered a resounding blow to the credibility of Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems and, by extension, to Beijing’s claims of military superiority. ➡️Few of the indigenously-developed systems used in the ongoing conflict include: Akash: The Akash Missile System is fully integrated into defensive posture. Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the Akash system plays a central role in India’s self-reliant defence strategy under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. Developed by Bharat Electronics, Akashteer proved to be a game-changer for India and enhances air defence through automation, real-time sensor integration, and decentralized engagement authority. INS Vikrant: India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant constructed by Cochin Shipyard. ➡️ India didn’t just destroy terror camps. It dismantled myths—about Chinese power, Pakistani defence, and who holds the technological edge in South Asia. ➡️ Further, in yesterday’s conference, Defence Minister Mr. Rajnath Singh, reaffirmed his ambitious target of achieving the export target of Rs500bn (from current Rs240bn) in FY29 and becoming the largest defence exporter by 2047. Few of the other recent activities in the sector include: ➡️ India and France recently sign Rs630bn deal for 26 Rafale fighters. Under offset obligations, components and equipment for the aircraft will be manufactured domestically in India with request to integrate indigenous weapons systems, including the Astra beyond-visual-range missiles and Rudram anti-radiation missiles, into the Rafale-M platform, providing a significant opportunity for the domestic companies. ➡️ Amidst ongoing crises within the Middle East, Russia’s war in Ukraine and rising geopolitical tensions due to great power competition, countries around the world are funneling more funds towards defence spending in 2024 as they implemented new spending pledges and large-scale procurement plans, according to SIPRI report. ➡️ NATO’s accelerated EURO800bn defence spend over the next 3-4 years, triggered by reduced US support under Trump-era policies, creates a significant export opportunity for Indian defence firms—especially private players, which account for 60–65% of exports. ➡️ Coalition government in Pakistan has endorsed an 18% increase in defence spending to over Rs2.5trn in the next budget due to heightened tensions with India. View: We maintain a positive outlook on the Defence sector owing to the ongoing geopolitical tensions, significant growth potential, increased defence budgets and increased investments in advanced technologies such as AI and robotics. We truly believe that 2025 is a “Year of Reforms” for the defence sector as India has proved its growing prowess in next-generation stand-off warfare—blending stealth, precision, and psychological supremacy. We believe that the private defence companies are set to benefit from the potential export opportunities while the PSUs will benefit from the domestic demands. We maintain our long-term positive view on Data Patterns, Bharat Electronics, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Zen Technologies, Paras Defence and Technology and Hindustan Aeronautics.

Posted on May 11, 2025 by Aayush Leave a Comment The website builder you pick today might save you headaches or create new ones tomorrow. What truly matters isn’t how easy the first page is to build but what happens when you need more from your site six months from now. In this post, we’ll compare the website builders available today and walk you through finding the right match for your needs. Along the way, we’ll see where WordPress combined with Divi stands when weighing all your options. Let’s discuss what you really need to know before making this important choice. Website builders have evolved significantly, but not all advancements truly benefit users. The features that matter most often hide behind marketing language. Understanding what makes a website builder truly valuable helps you cut through the noise. These key factors separate tools that will support your growth from those that will hinder it: Most website builders promise a world without code, but the truth lies in the details. You click buttons and drag boxes, and your website appears. That’s the dream. When you need something specific beyond templates, website builders take different approaches. Some limit you entirely, while others offer practical solutions through code snippets that extend functionality without requiring you to be a developer. Good builders balance what can be done without code against what’s possible when you need more. They offer plain English settings for complex features while providing pathways to advanced customization. The best platforms keep their code-free promise for daily tasks while giving clear options when your needs grow. They make basic functions simple enough for anyone while keeping advanced possibilities open for when you’re ready to take that next step. Website builders need to scale with your project. Some look great at first, but trap you in their basic features. Six months down the road, you’ll find yourself rebuilding from scratch. Smart builders let your site grow naturally. You start with what you need today: maybe just five pages and a contact form. Next year, when you want to add a shop, membership area, or booking system, those options slot right in. Watch out for systems that force major upgrades or platform changes when adding features. The right builder feels like adding rooms to your house, not moving to a new neighborhood. Your design stays intact while capabilities expand. Great platforms also let different parts of your site work differently when needed. Your blog, store, and main pages might need unique layouts, but should still feel like one connected website to visitors. This kind of flexibility pays off as your goals evolve and expand over time. Website builders work in two ways. Some keep you inside their world with built-in tools. Others connect to a broader range of outside services. Closed systems make things simple. Everything works together because one company runs it all. This works great until you need something they don’t have. Then you’re stuck. Open systems connect to many tools. Need a special calendar? Want a unique checkout? Open systems let you pick the right tool for each job. This matters more as your site grows. That perfect all-in-one package often feels too small when your needs change. Connected systems keep opening new doors as you learn what your site really needs. Look at how many outside services a builder works with. Can it connect to your email service? Does it work with different payment systems? The best builders bring together all parts of your online presence without forcing you into their way of doing things. Website builders should feel natural to use, not like you’re learning a new language. The best ones match how you already think about websites. Good interfaces use words that make sense. They call buttons “buttons” and not “interactive elements.” They organize tools in ways that follow your natural workflow. You shouldn’t need to hunt through five menus to find basic settings. Pay attention to how editing works. Some builders show exactly what your site will look like as you work. Others make you guess until you preview changes. The difference affects how confidently you’ll make updates. The best interfaces grow with you. They offer simple options upfront but reveal more advanced tools as you need them. This way, beginners aren’t overwhelmed, and experienced users aren’t held back. Your builder should speak your language today and still make sense tomorrow. The website builder market continues to divide into two distinct camps, each with different philosophies about what makes a good platform. These fundamental differences will help clarify why certain options might work better for specific needs. Fully hosted builders bundle everything under one roof. Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Shopify run the show behind the scenes while you shape how things look. These platforms are helpful for folks who need websites without technical responsibility. For example, a food truck can snap together a menu page before lunch service begins. You pay monthly, and they handle the boring stuff like security updates. Most people pick these platforms because: The catch? You’ll notice walls closing in as you grow. Your site lives on their territory, playing by their rules. That cool idea you just had might not work here. Many users bump into: These platforms nail it for straightforward sites that fit what they were built for. Your yoga studio, portfolio, or starter shop will feel right at home. But when your needs get specific, you’ll find yourself hunting for creative workarounds or settling for “close enough.” WordPress (.org) offers flexibility that appeals to both beginners and pros alike. This open-source platform powers everything from hobby blogs to major news sites, with a unique approach that separates your content from how you build it. Unlike locked platforms, WordPress gives you choices. Pick your host, select your tools, and build exactly what you need. It doesn’t matter if that’s a five-page local business site or a complex online store. What makes WordPress popular: Most users pair WordPress with page builders like Divi, Elementor, or Bricks Builder, which offer drag-and-drop design. These tools make creating beautiful sites straightforward for anyone. Some considerations: WordPress is suitable for businesses of all sizes. The corner bakery benefits from its simplicity while keeping options open for future growth. Meanwhile, larger operations leverage WordPress’ powerful capabilities without outgrowing the platform. You can start using WordPress right away, but there might be some technical overhead you need to learn. With thousands of articles, YouTube videos, and Reddit threads, among others, it is not that hard to get started. The WordPress ecosystem balances ease-of-use with room to expand, making it suitable for nearly any web project. Finding the right website builder requires more than comparing feature lists. The following will help you develop a systematic approach that matches your requirements with the right solution while avoiding common pitfalls that lead to regrettable choices. Website builders love to showcase their newest features, but the real question is whether those features match your skills. Before comparing platforms, take an honest look at what you can do now. The most impressive demo won’t help if you can’t recreate it when working on your actual website. Are you comfortable with basic design concepts? Do you know a bit of HTML, or do you prefer never to see code? Most people end up with tools that are either too basic or too complex. A good match meets you at your current skill level while giving you room to grow. Try listing what you’re comfortable doing and what makes you hesitate. Then find a builder that fits your abilities but offers clear paths to learn new skills. Website costs go beyond the monthly subscription fee. When choosing a builder, think about the total price tag over time. Many platforms start cheap but add costs as you grow. Need extra storage? That’s another fee. Want that cool feature? A premium plan is required. Custom domain? An annual charge. Some builders require paid add-ons for basics like contact forms or SEO tools, while others include everything in one price. Also, consider hidden costs, such as time spent learning workarounds for missing features or hiring help when you hit limitations. Look at what similar websites to yours need, then check if those features come standard or cost extra. A slightly higher upfront cost often saves money down the road when everything you need is included. Your website needs will change as your projects grow. The perfect builder for today might become limiting tomorrow. Ask yourself where your website might head in the next few years. Will you add online booking? Start selling products? Need member-only areas? What about integrating with CRM systems or email marketing platforms? Many website owners outgrow their first builder within 18 months. They either rebuild from scratch (painful) or work around increasing limitations (frustrating). Many fall into the trap of choosing based on current needs only. A portfolio site might later need an eCommerce component to sell digital products. A simple store could expand to subscription products. A local business might want to add location-based features. Look for a platform with room to expand without starting over. Check if it handles more complex features like custom post types, user accounts, or payment processing, even if you don’t need them yet. The best builders grow alongside you, with clear upgrade paths that don’t require rebuilding everything you’ve created. Good support saves websites from disaster. Yet most people only check support options after something breaks. Website builders offer vastly different help systems. Some provide 24/7 live chat with people who understand your problems. Others leave you searching through outdated forum posts at 2 AM. Test support before committing. Send a question during your trial period and see how quickly you get a helpful answer. Watch for templated responses that don’t address your specific issue. Community support matters too. Active user forums mean solutions exist for common problems. Look for recent posts and helpful replies, not ghost towns of unanswered questions. Also, check the knowledge base. Are tutorials clear and current? Do they cover advanced topics or just the basics? The depth of documentation often reveals how seriously a company takes user success. Likewise, there should be community tutorials. They indicate the possible use cases. Remember: even experts need help sometimes. The right support system turns problems into quick fixes rather than day-ruining roadblocks. Website builders increasingly offer AI features that can be helpful additions to your toolkit. The key is understanding what these tools can realistically do for you. AI assistants should excel at streamlining fairly common tasks: suggesting and creating layout options, helping with content, offering design based on your existing elements, and even refining your current content and assets. During your trial period, explore how these AI tools handle your specific needs. The best ones complement your creative vision rather than try to replace it. Look for AI features that learn from your preferences and adapt to your style over time. The most useful ones become more valuable as you use them. Even simple AI tools can be surprisingly helpful when they address specific pain points in the design process rather than attempting to do everything. With your priorities clear, it’s time to see how the leading website builders compare. This direct comparison highlights where each platform shines and falls short. Rather than general rankings, we focus on specific strengths and weaknesses that matter most when making your decision. Several WordPress page builders dominate the ecosystem, each with loyal followers. Their approaches to design, editing, and site management vary significantly. This comparison reveals which builder provides the best overall experience when building a WordPress site from scratch. Divi, created by us at Elegant Themes, is among the most used WordPress page builders thanks to its mix of adaptability and strength. With the Visual Builder and 200+ modules, you see updates right away as you work, letting you put elements exactly where needed without wondering how they’ll look. Many website projects bog down when building from zero. Divi solves this problem with its library of over 2,000 expertly crafted layouts. Want a particular section? Pick one that is close to your idea and change it to suit your needs. The Theme Builder gives you more than just page-level control. You can craft custom headers, footers, and page templates that work across your whole site, keeping your design steady without doing the same work on every page. Anyone making a new website should check out Divi Quick Sites. Just share some details about what you do, and it builds complete sites based on your input. These aren’t simple templates but well-planned layouts made for your specific needs. If you want extra help, Divi AI can create images, edit photos, And write content matching your tone. Skip the many settings adjustments: just tell it what you want, and Divi AI builds it using your site’s current design patterns. It can even generate sections and code when needed. With the Divi Pro package, you get useful extras alongside Divi AI: Divi Cloud keeps your favorite designs for later use, Divi Teams allows work with up to 4 people (with option to add more), and VIP support gives quick answers when you run into trouble. This bundle can save you up to $751 as compared to purchasing all components separately. Moreover, unlike our competitors, one license works for as many websites as you want with no content limits. Divi connects well with over 75 tools and plugins, including top SEO tools that work right in the editor. If you have questions, the 76,000-member community on Facebook offers practical tips from their own use. Plus, with our Marketplace, you won’t run out of extensions, child themes, and more created by trusted Divi experts. Divi is different from other WordPress builders because it mixes simplicity with advanced features. This combination works well for both newcomers building their first site and experts creating complex web projects. Get Divi Now Divi 5 (currently in alpha but ready for new website builds) introduces powerful new ways to build WordPress websites. Its thoughtfully designed structure helps you create sites that load quicker and perform better. Besides a ground-up redesign of the builder to eliminate shortcodes and move towards a block-based approach, Divi 5 introduces several quality-of-life improvements to the builder, such as multi-panel docking that keeps your design tools accessible but organized and canvas scaling, which shows exactly how your site looks at different screen sizes with a simple drag of the workspace edge. Design consistency becomes effortless in Divi 5. The new Option Group Presets save styles for buttons, headings, and other elements you can apply to your site. Design Variables store your brand colors, fonts, and spacing values in one central location. Need to update your brand blue? Change it once, and every instance updates automatically. Responsive design reaches new levels with customizable breakpoints, giving you control at specific screen widths beyond standard device sizes. Advanced CSS functions now work natively in Divi’s fields, use calc() for dynamic measurements, clamp() for perfectly scaling typography, and min()/max() for intelligent layouts. One of the biggest additions in Divi 5 is the ability to nest rows. You can now place rows inside other rows, letting you build complex and elegant layouts. Want a special section with its own row structure? Just add it inside an existing row. This sets the stage for Divi’s move toward flexbox layouts. Soon, you’ll have much better control over how your content behaves — from spacing between columns to how elements stack on phones. The days of fighting with CSS to align things perfectly are coming to an end. Divi 5 delivers the perfect balance between simplicity and power. You’ll create better websites faster, regardless of your experience level, while maintaining complete creative freedom. Even though it’s currently in the preliminary alpha version, you can start using it on fresh websites today, and it’s accessible to all ongoing and new clients. Nonetheless, we advise against implementing Divi 5 on an existing Divi site at this moment. Gutenberg ships with WordPress right out of the box. On its own, it gives you a basic set of tools, but with a handful of addons like Stackable, Kadence Blocks, or Spectra, you can turn it into something much more useful. These popular addons give you ready-made sections, cool layouts, and specialized blocks that make building pages less of a headache. What makes Gutenberg work well is how it stacks content pieces in a way that makes sense, similar to how you might organize sections on paper. The block editor plays nicely with WordPress core functions, keeping your site running fast without the extra code bloat you’ll find elsewhere. Getting used to Gutenberg takes some time since it doesn’t follow the usual drag-and-drop approach of other builders. But after you work with it for a bit, you’ll find making updates becomes second nature. But, Gutenberg, and naturally all of its addons, are very clunky to use, and the options aren’t as intuitive as other, more mature, thought-out website builders. As WordPress keeps improving Gutenberg each year, staying with this option means your site tools keep getting better automatically. Elementor took the WordPress world by storm with its smooth drag-and-drop approach. The free version gives you enough tools to build good-looking sites, while the Pro version unlocks theme building and advanced widgets. You can move things exactly where you want them on the page with real-time previews showing exactly what visitors will see. The spacing controls let you nudge elements into place without touching code, and the responsive options make sure your site looks good on phones too. This builder stands out for its massive widget library that handles everything from basic text to booking forms and pricing tables. The templates save tons of time – just pick one that looks close to what you want and change the parts that need tweaking. The ecosystem includes specialized add-ons from third-party developers that extend what you can build. Bricks Builder is a newer WordPress page builder that appeals to users with some tech background. The tools are arranged sensibly, but many features use terms that assume you know the basics of web design. Bricks focuses on clean code and faster loading times by cutting out extra bulk. You pick elements, adjust their settings, and see changes right away, much like other builders but with more technical options visible. Beginners might find it harder to learn at first. While anyone can use the basic tools, many of the best features need some understanding of CSS, queries, and conditions. This makes it less friendly for total newcomers. The builder includes code sections, dynamic data options, and site-wide style controls that developers and designers appreciate. There aren’t as many templates as older builders, though the collection keeps growing. People who switch to Bricks often mention the cleaner code and more logical setup as big pluses, but those without tech skills might need to look up terms more often while building. Having explored each WordPress builder’s capabilities, one question remains: which one actually performs best when building real websites? Let’s compare these tools based on what truly matters for website owners to determine which builder delivers the most value for your specific needs. Get Divi Today After looking at the key factors that matter for website success, Divi stands out as the clear winner in the WordPress builder space. While Divi does require some time to master, the investment pays off through unmatched design flexibility and value that competitors simply cannot rival. Both newcomers and seasoned professionals benefit from a tool set that adapts to their growing needs without forcing compromises. When looking for a builder that evolves alongside your skills and business objectives, Divi consistently delivers where alternatives fall short. Hosted platforms like Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Shopify compete fiercely for different market segments. Each has strengthened certain aspects of its offerings while maintaining core limitations. Let’s compare how they compare when tested with real business requirements. Wix offers both beginners and seasoned web designers a straightforward path to website creation. The platform stands out with its hands-on editor that lets you move elements anywhere on your page. You won’t need coding skills to build something that looks professional. What makes working with Wix so straightforward? Consider these aspects: Many website owners appreciate how Wix combines all these tools in one package without making things complicated. The platform works well for simple portfolio sites but has enough power for business websites with online stores too. Squarespace stands out with its visually striking templates and focus on visual impact. The platform puts design first, making it a go-to choice for photographers, artists, restaurants, and boutiques who need sites that catch the eye. Squarespace hits the sweet spot for creatives and small shops who want polish without complexity. Webflow lets you build fancy websites without coding. You get the same results as hand-coded sites but through a visual editor anyone can use. Many web designers love it. Webflow works great for people who know design basics but don’t want to mess with code. Shopify specializes in eCommerce websites. The platform focuses on selling products rather than general website features. Shopify works for various business sizes, from single-product startups to established brands with hundreds of items. After walking through each platform, let’s cut through the fluff and get practical about which builder works best for specific needs. No platform wins across all categories, but clear winners emerge when you look at what actually matters for different website types. Looking at the full picture, Wix stands out for most website owners. The platform balances ease of use with powerful features that work as your site grows. While others excel in specific areas, Wix delivers what matters daily: building what you want without constant roadblocks. With Wix matched against Divi on WordPress, we can finally see how they handle real-world challenges. This side-by-side test reveals surprising strengths and weaknesses that only become apparent when building actual sites. 🤝 Winner: Tie with Different Strengths — Wix gets beginners started faster, while Divi requires some learning but becomes more efficient for ongoing work. Both are strong options depending on your starting point and long-term plans. 🥇 Winner: Divi — Divi provides substantially more design freedom with no arbitrary limitations. The Theme Builder allows complete site-wide design control that Wix simply cannot match, especially for headers, footers, and dynamic templates. 📈 Edge: Divi — The numbers make the case here. Divi costs less over time, especially if you build more than one site. The upfront price is higher but saves money down the road. 🥇 Winner: Divi — WordPress with Divi gives you more technical freedom. You’re not locked into one company’s system, which matters if your needs change later. 🥇 Winner: Divi — Both handle everyday website needs well, but Divi scales better for growing sites. The WordPress foundation means fewer walls as your site expands. After looking at the key features, you’ll find that Divi for WordPress is usually the best choice for most website projects. Wix is easy if you’re just starting, but you’ll soon hit limits that are hard to work around. With Divi, you get a tool that’s easy for beginners but also powerful enough to handle anything you want to build later. If you spend a little time learning it, you’ll enjoy more creative options, better flexibility, and save money in the long run. If you want your website to grow with your needs, Divi isn’t just a builder. It’s a full solution. You can keep improving your site without starting over or moving to another platform. Website builders shape how your online presence grows or gets stuck. Choose wisely the first time. The right builder matches both your current skills and future plans. Consider what features truly matter, how much support you’ll need, and whether AI tools actually help your workflow. Look beyond the monthly subscription to calculate total ownership costs. Will you require paid add-ons, extra storage, or developer help? WordPress + Divi stands out by offering both simplicity and scalability. While many builders force compromises as your needs evolve, Divi grows alongside your vision, maintaining a balance of user-friendly tools and professional capabilities. Take time now to pick a foundation that adapts to you. Build your website once, then focus on what truly matters — growing your presence online. Get Divi Today Explore plans, pricing and features.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session.

The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally.

Title: Bitcoin Eyes $105K as SEC Talks Tokenization – 3 New Crypto Projects to Watch

The crypto market just turned up the volume. Bitcoin is now flirting with the $105K mark, sending traders and holders into a frenzy over the weekend. Positive headlines around the U.S. economy and fresh signals from regulators are adding more fuel to the fire. It feels like we’re standing at the edge of a new crypto breakout – and not just for Bitcoin. The SEC’s upcoming Tokenization Roundtable has investors whispering about a future where stocks, bonds, real estate, and even your favorite meme coins could live on the blockchain. If that future is anywhere close, today’s early movers could be tomorrow’s market leaders. Let’s take a look at three new crypto projects catching waves right now. This weekend, Bitcoin took another step toward breaking its all-time high, riding a wave of optimism after U.S. President Donald Trump announced progress on resetting trade relations with China. A sigh of relief spread through global markets. Investors see fewer trade tensions as a green light for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. At the same time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced its upcoming Tokenization Roundtable. Smart investors know the biggest profits come from being early – and these three crypto projects could be among the best altcoins to watch in the next wave. The first project catching serious attention is Solaxy ($SOLX), currently priced at just $0.00172, with nearly $35M already raised in its presale. But make no mistake – this isn’t another green energy token. Solaxy is the first-ever Solana Layer 2, built to unlock the full potential of one of crypto’s fastest ecosystems. Solaxy solves Solana’s biggest pain points – network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability issues – while enhancing its core strengths of speed and low fees. $SOLX is a multichain, bridging both Solana and Ethereum, two of the most powerful blockchains on the planet. This gives users access to Ethereum’s massive DeFi ecosystem and Solana’s booming meme coin market – all in one place. It’s a game-changer for traders and developers alike. As the SEC’s Tokenization Roundtable puts blockchain integration in the regulatory spotlight, Solaxy’s multichain infrastructure makes it perfectly positioned to benefit from this shift toward tokenized assets. Experts predict $SOLX’s price could reach as high as $0.032 in 2025, representing massive upside from today’s presale price. With top Layer 2 tokens sitting at billion-dollar market caps, Solaxy could be positioning itself as a future leader in Web3 and DeFi. If you love Bitcoin but wish you could crank the excitement up a notch, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) might be your dream ticket. Priced at $0.002505, with over $5.5M raised in presale, $BTCBULL is built for traders who believe Bitcoin’s climb to $1M is just getting started. What makes $BTCBULL special? It’s the first crypto presale that rewards holders with real Bitcoin. Every time Bitcoin hits major price milestones – $150K, $200K– $BTCBULL holders receive $BTC airdrops. But there’s a catch: you need to buy and hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet to qualify for these rewards. No Best Wallet, no airdrops. Simple as that. $BTCBULL also features token burns at key Bitcoin price points such as $125K, $175K , and $225K, reducing supply and increasing scarcity as the market heats up. It’s a double win – more Bitcoin, fewer tokens. Bitcoin-themed meme coins are rare, and $BTCBULL fills this gap perfectly. With built-in $BTC rewards and a growing community, $BTCBULL could ride Bitcoin’s bull run all the way to the top. Dogecoin ($DOGE) is back in the spotlight, proving that the original meme coin still has plenty of bark and bite left. Over the past week, $DOGE has surged over 34%, reaching its highest price in two months at approximately $0.23, reaching its highest price in two months. This resurgence aligns with a broader crypto market rally, as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high. The renewed interest in $DOGE isn’t solely due to retail enthusiasm. Open interest in Dogecoin futures has climbed to $2.52B, the highest since mid-February, indicating increased trader activity and market engagement. Institutional players are also taking note. Grayscale Investments recently launched a Dogecoin-focused fund, exposing investors to $DOGE as it evolves from a meme to a viable payment method. Notably, $DOGE’s block time is just one minute, facilitating faster transaction confirmations and lower fees compared to other cryptocurrencies. With the SEC’s upcoming Tokenization Roundtable and the broader market’s bullish sentiment, Dogecoin’s resurgence positions it as a key player in the next wave of crypto adoption. Bitcoin’s race toward $105K is shaking the market awake, but it’s not running alone. With the SEC focusing on tokenization and investor confidence returning, projects like Solaxy, BTC Bull Token, and Dogecoin could capture the next wave of attention. Whether it’s Layer 2 tech, meme-powered Bitcoin rewards, or the comeback of the original meme coin, all three are worth watching. As always, do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

The launch will support the AFRL's Rocket Experimentation for Global Agile Logistics (REGAL) program, an initiative designed to demonstrate rocket-based point-to-point transportation for rapid global cargo delivery. As part of this contract, Rocket Lab's Neutron will conduct a re-entry test, validating its ability to return payloads safely to Earth - a key milestone for future REGAL missions. Neutron, Rocket Lab's next-generation reusable launch vehicle, is engineered to deliver up to 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit, providing government and commercial customers a cost-effective, reliable, and flexible launch option. The vehicle's advanced carbon composite construction and integrated recovery design enable it to return its first stage and payload fairings as a single unit, significantly reducing turnaround times and enhancing operational efficiency. According to Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, "Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability for government and commercial space users in medium launch. This opportunity for the U.S. Air Force not only helps to advance space logistics, it also demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the DOD in Neutron's capabilities. Anticipation is high for Neutron's inaugural flight this year, and we're excited to showcase Neutron as a platform for R and D for point-to-point logistics for the DoD." Rocket Lab has been making significant progress at its launch site at Wallops Island, Virginia, with site completion expected within the coming weeks. The company continues to advance production and testing efforts for the Neutron rocket, including full-scale component trials and Archimedes engine testing, all of which remain on track for the vehicle's first flight in the second half of 2025. Rocket Lab's Neutron is a reusable medium-lift launch vehicle optimized for both government and commercial missions, including satellite mega-constellations and national security payloads. Neutron's unique design, featuring a carbon composite structure and an innovative upper stage, enables efficient payload deployment and high reusability. Powered by nine Archimedes engines on its first stage and a vacuum-optimized Archimedes engine on the second stage, Neutron operates from Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 3 (LC-3) at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia.

Title: Big Layoffs Are Hitting These Sectors The Hardest
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/05/10/big-layoffs-are-hitting-these-sectors-the-hardest/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T21:16:59Z

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Depressed businesswoman getting laid off from her job, talking to her colleagues while carrying her ... More belongings and leaving the job. Layoffs have surged across an array of industries. Some of the problems are caused by a volatile economic landscape. President Trump’s initial tariff policy put a scare into both corporate executives and consumers. Additionally, technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, are changing the workplace. Corporate restructurings due to changing circumstances added to the trend of layoffs. With more than 221,812 jobs eliminated in the first months of the year, workers and companies alike are forced to confront an ever changing challenging environment. Layoffs in 2025 are reshaping the workforce. Government, tech, retail, accounting, manufacturing, and logistics have been dealing with the biggest cuts. Driven by tariffs, cost-cutting, AI adoption, and federal downsizing, these layoffs show a shift in the economy. For workers, they’ll need to stay proactive with upskilling, networking, and building financial resilience to navigate this storm. The layoff wave has spared few industries. Some sectors have borne the brunt more than others. Approximately one-third of layoffs stem from the government sector or related industries. Driven by federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration, agencies like the National Park Service (1,500 layoffs), U.S. Geological Survey (1,000), and the Bureau of Reclamation (100–150) are implementing significant reductions in force (RIFs). Tech The tech sector has the dubious honor of leading in layoffs, per TechCrunch. Over 23,400 jobs were cut in April alone. Companies like CrowdStrike (500 layoffs), Meta, Microsoft, and Block are downsizing. By comparison, 2024 saw 150,000 tech job cuts across 549 firms. High-profile firms like Amazon, Google, and Tesla also contributed to the tally. According to layoffs.fyi, 52,340 tech employees were laid off from around 123 tech companies. There were roughly 61,296 gov’t employees laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE initiatives, and about 171,843 total federal departures in 2025. U.S. retailers eliminated over 64,000 jobs in the first four months of 2025. This made the retail sector the second-hardest-hit industry after technology and ahead of most other consumer-facing industries, reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Bankruptcies at Joann Fabrics (19,000 jobs), Party City (16,000), and Big Lots (1,000) account for significant losses, with other retailers cutting jobs to brace for economic pressures like tariffs. Big Four management consultancy PwC laid off 1,500 U.S. workers (2% of its workforce), following 1,800 cuts in 2024. Other similar firms such as KPMG, EY, and Deloitte have also announced layoffs, citing low attrition and pressure on profit margins. Companies like Volvo (125 layoffs at its Charleston plant), General Motors (1,695 at its Fairfax Assembly plant), and Mercedes-Benz have announced mass layoffs. These cuts are tied to production pauses and cost-cutting amid economic uncertainty. UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs in 2025, citing global trade policy changes and tariffs that discourage shipping. Trucking and retail are also expected to face mass layoffs due to tariff-driven economic pressures. The Trump administration’s tariffs are disrupting supply chains and raising costs, particularly in retail, logistics, and manufacturing. UPS explicitly cited “changes in global trade policy” as a driver for its 20,000 job cuts. Economists warn that tariffs could trigger stagflation or a recession, further pressuring companies to downsize. Many companies are streamlining operations to boost efficiency or profitability. CrowdStrike’s 5% workforce reduction aims to achieve a $10 billion annual recurring revenue target, while PwC’s layoffs address low attrition and bottom-line pressures. Tech firms are cutting middle managers and embracing AI-driven or self-led teams. The rise of AI and automation is displacing jobs, particularly in tech and manufacturing. Retail giants like Joann Fabrics and Party City faced bankruptcies, leading to massive layoffs. Even surviving retailers like Big Lots are cutting jobs to stabilize finances. The Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal government has led to mass firings and hiring freezes, with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) initially issuing but later revoking some layoff notices. This creates uncertainty for federal workers. What Should Workers Know About Layoffs Here’s what you need to know and what to do. Monitor your sector for signs of instability. Retail and tech workers should be vigilant, given their high layoff rates. Federal employees need to track policy changes, as further RIFs are expected. Resources like WARNTracker.com and Layoffs.fyi provide real-time data on announced layoffs. In tech, generic skills won’t cut it. Identify niche skills your employer or competitors lack. This includes AI tools. If your company doesn’t offer it, invest in training to keep current and ahead of the pack. For retail or manufacturing workers, cross-training in adjacent roles like logistics or e-commerce. Continuous learning is a non-negotiable, as you don’t want to be left behind. Layoffs often come with little warning. Severance packages may be minimal or not offered. Put aside an emergency fund that can last at least around 6–12 months of living expenses in savings. Don’t feel it’s beneath you to take on a side hustle to bring home some much needed money. Start networking. Relationships can open doors to new opportunities. Engage with industry peers on platforms like LinkedIn, attend virtual or in-person events, and reconnect with former colleagues. A strong network can help you land a role before layoffs hit. Layoffs can feel personal, especially when companies like Meta label affected workers as “low performers.” Don’t let it bring you down. Seek advice and support from mentors or career coaches. Reframe a layoff as an opportunity to pivot to a more stable or fulfilling role. To be fair, it’s easy said than done. Tariffs and trade wars are sometimes scapegoats for companies. They may use these trends to conduct firings, pivoting to AI-driven models. The tech sector’s volatility, for instance, isn’t solely about innovation. The tech sector misjudged the market and overhired during the pandemic boom. Now companies are paying for it by over-correcting to appease shareholders. Workers should be skeptical of corporate narratives. When companies cite “low attrition” as a layoff rationale, it’s often code for protecting profits over people. Similarly, the “low performer” label at Meta looks like a tactic to deflect blame from poor strategic planning. The real risk for workers isn’t just losing a job. It’s being left behind in an economy increasingly prioritizing automation. On the flip side, this chaos presents opportunities. Sectors like healthcare and transportation are adding jobs, and remote work remains a viable path in tech. Workers who adapt by mastering high-demand skills, building personal brands, or exploring entrepreneurial ventures can thrive despite the uncertainty. The key is self-leadership. Keep your eyes open for opportunities. Don’t wait for employers to dictate your future.

Title: Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's $2B AI Startup Thinking Machines Lab Sets $50M Investment Minimum, Backed By Andreessen Horowitz And Sequoia Capital

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Mira Murati, the former chief technology officer of OpenAI and a central figure behind ChatGPT, is launching her own AI startup, and she’s doing it in blockbuster fashion. Thinking Machines Lab, the AI company founded by Murati early this year, is raising a $2 billion seed round at a $10 billion valuation. According to Business Insider, the round is being led by Andreessen Horowitz, with support from Sequoia Capital and other top-tier investors. Those interested in backing the venture are being asked to commit a minimum of $50 million per check, a staggering requirement for what would be one of the largest seed rounds in startup history. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The startup's ambition is to reshape the way artificial intelligence is built and understood. According to the company’s website, Thinking Machines Lab will focus on making AI “more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable,” highlighting a shift toward both transparency and user control. That positioning places the company in direct conceptual competition with AI giants like OpenAI, Google's Gemini, Elon Musk's xAI, and Anthropic, which are all currently racing to define the next generation of large language models and autonomous systems, Business Insider reported. Murati spent more than six years at OpenAI, contributing to the development of ChatGPT and other advanced AI research projects. According to Business Insider, she was briefly appointed interim CEO in November 2023, after the board unexpectedly removed Sam Altman, a decision that triggered internal upheaval across the company. Following Altman's reinstatement just days later, Murati returned to her position as chief technology officer. Trending: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000. Andreessen Horowitz, the legendary venture capital firm that previously backed Facebook and Airbnb ABNB, Financial Times reported, is leading the round alongside Sequoia Capital, known for its investments in Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and WhatsApp, Fortune says. Their involvement may signal strong institutional belief in Murati's long-term potential. Thinking Machines Lab is also assembling a brain trust of former OpenAI engineers and scientists. According to The Founders Magazine, team members include Bob McGrew, former head of research at OpenAI, Alec Radford, one of the minds behind the original GPT, Barret Zoph, a top researcher on ChatGPT, and John Schulman, co-lead of the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technique that powers modern AI safety. See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Few early-stage startups command minimum investments in the tens of millions. According to Business Insider, Murati’s $50 million threshold is a practical necessity since training large models and building scalable infrastructure requires capital on a massive scale. If the raise closes as expected, Thinking Machines Lab will stand beside OpenAI and Anthropic as one of the most well-capitalized AI startups in the world, Business Insider says, and one of the only ones led by a woman. With technical vision, elite backing, and a mission to open up the black box of AI, Murati's next chapter may reshape the way the world builds and interacts with intelligent systems.

Between the awful Raptor Lake instability scandal, disappointing Arrow Lake launch, canceling the much-hyped 20A node, and waves of layoffs, the chipmaker seems stuck playing defense. Intel's stock price hasn't recovered from the massive drop, and AMD continues to rack up wins. Even Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, publicly acknowledged the myriad of challenges the company is facing. What you might have missed, however, is that Intel has been nurturing a long-term manufacturing pivot to redefine its role in the global semiconductor ecosystem. Possible tariffs on semiconductor chips from outside the U.S. are only the latest incentive for Intel to increase local manufacturing. With billions invested in both domestic and international fab expansion, and a resurgent foundry business, Intel is trying to become the top player in a world that cares a lot more about where the chips are coming from. It won't be easy, but it's necessary In case you didn't know, Intel holds the most U.S.-based manufacturing plants among chipmakers, which could be a huge shield against new semiconductor tariffs in the near future. Once the biggest chip manufacturer in the world, Intel, for the first time, outsourced the manufacturing of a major CPU lineup to TSMC. Intel's in-house foundry failed to meet expectations, and it was forced to use TSMC's cutting-edge process nodes. Thanks to the $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding by the government, Intel has received the green light to invest in projects across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The CHIPS Act funds alone aren't nearly enough, but that hasn't stopped Intel from pouring $32 billion into two new fabs in Arizona, around $3.5 billion into advanced packaging plants in New Mexico, and $28 billion into two new fabs in Ohio (production is delayed to 2030, though). Even Oregon is getting a 300mm foundry plant. If the Trump administration goes through with additional tariffs on non-U.S. chips, Intel's domestic manufacturing capabilities could prove to be a strong moat. Almost every company outsources its chip manufacturing to TSMC, Samsung, and other Asian fabs, so Intel's strong domestic base can be one of the key levers in its gradual revival. The company is clearly betting big on expanding domestic operations; it's not a half-baked strategy anymore. I certainly don't. Intel isn't just hoping to get its home affairs in order; its overseas expansion is also ramping up. In 2024, its long-awaited Fab 34 joint venture in Ireland began ramping up production using the Intel 4 (its first EUV-based node) and Intel 3 process nodes. In Israel, Intel invested around $25 billion to build Fab 38 after a $3.2 billion subsidy from the Israeli government. Poland also greenlit $1.9 billion in state support last year for Intel's new $4.6 billion plant. Even in Germany, Intel plans to invest over $30 billion in two fabs, supported by $10.7 billion in government subsidies under the European Chips Act. These international fabs aren't just for capacity expansion but also geopolitical hedging in an increasingly unpredictable landscape. Although some of these projects have been delayed, the increasing willingness of several countries to subsidize Intel's global expansion shows their commitment to reducing reliance on the likes of TSMC and Samsung. This distributed manufacturing model could help Intel sidestep future supply chain bottlenecks and regional disruptions, like we saw during the pandemic and the recent Taiwan earthquakes. Intel has outlined its new processes for the next few years, but what does it all mean? A big piece of Intel’s pivot is its foundry business — and it’s finally gaining traction. At Intel’s 2024 Foundry Direct Connect event, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had already signed several customers for its upcoming 18A process. The list now includes names like Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Qualcomm, and defense contractors Trusted Semiconductor Solutions and Reliable MicroSystems. Intel had also announced a collaboration with Arm to produce its SoCs using the 18A process node. And most recently, Intel and TSMC agreed to enter into a joint venture whereby the latter would own 20% of Intel's foundry business. This is a huge vote of confidence in Intel's revitalized process roadmap. It signals that customers are at least willing to bet on Intel again. The company's plan to regain process leadership hinges on the success of 18A as well as future nodes such as 14A. Now structured as a subsidiary, Intel's foundry arm could play a huge role in Team Blue's resurgence. Intel might be on its way to becoming a company that doesn't hoard in-house manufacturing, collaborates with rivals, and treats its fabs as a revenue stream instead of just a moat. An unlikely duo. Intel has been pursuing smart capital, distributed manufacturing, and a resurgent foundry business in a bid to regain process leadership and solve its financial woes. Aided by federal grants, international subsidies for global expansion, and collaborations with the biggest names in the business might just prove to be the push Intel needed to regain its lost sheen. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved TSMC has denied any joint venture with any firm recently during their lastest earnings call/conference call. The cat's out of the bag on the Arc B770. Arm processors have shaken up the market, but x86 isn't folding any time soon This might leave you surprised Tired of relying on subscription-heavy cloud services?

Title: Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety

Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) At about $117 a share, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still trading about 15% below its all-time highs seen in January 2025. Revenues grew more than 110% over the last year, while net profit margins exceeded 50%. With artificial intelligence tunes playing everywhere, do you think Nvidia stock is a good long-term bet at current levels? What about at a 30% discount at about $82 per share? Now we’re talking. So if you think $82 per share for the AI poster-child is a steal, and have some cash ready to go, here’s a clever trade. The Trade: 12% yield at 30% margin of safety, by selling Put Options NVDA stock is trading at about $117. You can sell a long-dated Put option expiring June 18, 2026, with a strike price of $82, and collect roughly $680 in premium per contract (each contract represents 100 shares). That’s about an 8.3% yield on the $8,200 you’re setting aside for the possibility of buying the stock. Plus, don’t forget, this cash parked in a savings or money market account will earn an extra 4%. So we’re talking >12% yield overall. Separately, see Tesla Stock To $1,500 And here’s the kicker. You're agreeing to buy Nvidia at $82, a roughly 30% discount to the current market price, only if the stock drops below that level by the expiration date. Think that’s too risky? Want a higher margin of safety - for example 40%? Use a $70 strike instead of $82 strike - your overall earnings will still be an impressive 9% instead of 12%, and you’ll enjoy more peace. The strategy is reliable because large institutions have tested the strategy at scale, and for the right long-term investors, may serve just right. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Sure, I see the 12% return, however, what if Nvidia drops more than 30%, isn’t there some risk? Of course, there is risk. Because, there are two ways this could unfold: In short, you win either way, especially if you're comfortable owning a quality company like Nvidia for the long haul. Is that a good deal though? It could very well be, if you consider three facts -- If you do end up owning NVDA stock, you’re not stuck with some speculative small-cap stock. You're holding a company that is: And The Risk of a Crash Is Lower Than You Think Selling puts is only as good as the business you’re willing to own. With Nvidia, that bar is high. Here’s why: The Bottom Line - Margin of Safety This trade offers an asymmetric risk-reward setup, with a built-in 30% discount. Either way, you come out ahead. These are the kinds of margin-of-safety setups and asymmetric risk-reward tradeoffs that we seek in the Trefis HQ portfolio, which is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tesla Stock To $1,500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. HAWTHORNE, CALIFORNIA - MAY 2: A Tesla Model S is seen parked at a Tesla Supercharger on May 2, 2025 ... More in Hawthorne, California. (Photo by Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images) Here’s how Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) can reach $1,500, up from $300 currently. Tesla sold 1.7 million cars in 2024. The key ingredient is that Elon Musk is back in the driver’s seat, with his work at the Trump White House apparently winding down. Fully focused. Focused on the original mission: transition the world to electric vehicles and become a market leader. Ten million cars a year. Market leadership has a halo effect. We believe that momentum will provide a strong tailwind for Tesla’s next bets - humanoid robots and robotaxis as well. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. We lay out our upside case for Tesla to $1,500 below, as a counterpoint to our previous analysis that outlined a downside case to $100. Separately, see Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety. So, how does this happen? First, cars. Tesla already has EV leadership. Despite the recent slowdown in EV sales in the U.S., the truth is that people want electric vehicles. Nearly 50% of cars sold in China in 2024 were EVs. This didn’t begin in China - it began in the U.S. Greta Thunberg thundered first in Europe. Then the climate message spread everywhere. People get it. Coal and gas are yesterday. Clean energy is today. The industry just needs its leader back - Musk, level-headed and championing clean energy again. The idea is simple. If China can do it, why can’t America? See Tesla’s lost cause. Once consumers in the U.S. and Europe reconnect with the urgency of the climate mission, and Musk plays a central role in it, it becomes unstoppable. Can Tesla scale to 2.5 million cars this year and 3 million in 2026? Musk has done it before, going from 500,000 to 1.8 million cars in just three years. He can do it again. On the upside, we estimate that Tesla delivers 5 million vehicles by 2027, and 10 million by 2030. At an average price of $40,000 per vehicle and a conservative 20% net margin, that’s $80 billion in profit. At a 25x multiple, that’s a $2 trillion valuation for the automotive business alone. Tesla has other major projects that could drive valuation. The robotaxi launch in Austin, expected around June, could kick off an enormous new business. To be sure, Tesla will be playing catch-up with Google's Waymo, which has offered autonomous rides in several cities for almost five years now. Can Waymo 3x Google stock? But Tesla controls the whole stack - it builds the EVs, develops the software, and also operates the charging network. It also has a large base of vehicles on the road that can be brought on board its robotaxi fleet. That’s a real edge. The ride-hailing market is already huge. Uber handled over 230 million rides per week in Q4 2024 alone. At roughly $30 per ride, that’s a $375 billion annual revenue pool. And that’s just human-driven rides. Autonomous could be bigger still. Waymo retains users better than Uber or Lyft and reports much fewer crashes than the U.S. average. Now for every person hailing a ride, ten still drive themselves. That could change quickly once people start seeing others relaxing in the back seat, watching Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel. The roughly $375 billion market could double. A $750 billion autonomous ride-hailing market isn’t far-fetched. Now, suppose Tesla captures a third of that - $250 billion in annual revenue. At a 25% net margin, that’s almost $63 billion in profit. Apply a 30x multiple, and you get $1.9 trillion in value for ride-hailing alone. Tesla is also working on humanoid robots called Optimus. The company says the robots are designed to carry out dangerous, boring, or repetitive tasks. Musk believes Optimus could eventually be Tesla’s most valuable business - and with good reason. Global labor shortages, rising wages, and soaring demand for automation all make the case for physical AI compelling. Optimus is hardly a moonshot. It’s the next logical step for a company that already builds advanced robots to manufacture its cars. And Tesla’s cars themselves are among the most sophisticated robots on wheels. Musk has said Tesla will build 10,000 Optimus units in 2025, with “several thousand” doing useful work by year-end. With a global labor force of over 3.5 billion people, even a fraction of that market could be transformative. In our upside case, Tesla might build 10 million Optimus units per year, priced at $20,000 each with 20% net margins - that’s $40 billion in annual profit. At a 30x multiple, that implies a $1.2 trillion business. Add it all up, and a $5 trillion valuation for Tesla starts to look plausible. That translates to a stock price of over $1,500 per share. What about a timeline for this? Building this sort of scale can take some time. Investors will need to look well into the future. Think 2030 or maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Tesla has the technology and scale, and is addressing a potentially massive market. With Musk back in the driver's seat, this high valuation is within reach. While Tesla is advancing transformative technologies, Trefis HQ portfolio is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Wells Fargo is updating its outlook on Uber (UBER), reportedly forecasting an explosive share price for the $173 billion ride-hailing company. In a new note to clients, Wells Fargo’s Ken Gawrelski and other analysts raise Uber’s price target to $100 from $90 and reiterate an overweight rating, reports Barron’s. The analysts also say Uber’s share price may rise to as high as $126, a more than 52% increase from the stock’s $82.81 close on Friday, as competition is likely to drive company efficiencies. “We believe the stock is likely to outperform as healthy fundamental trends drive upward estimate revisions.” The update comes after Uber’s reported earnings for the first quarter topped analysts’ estimates with earnings per share of $0.83, soaring above the $0.51 consensus forecast. The company also printed $11.5 billion in revenue in Q1, a 14% growth on a year-over-year basis. However, the company fell short of the anticipated revenue of $11.6 billion in the first quarter of the year. One highlight reported was that users booked more than three billion “trips,” up 18% from the first quarter of 2024. The Wells Fargo team notes that top-line trends remain strong for both Uber’s mobility and delivery segments. They also say that Uber’s deployment of autonomous vehicles in the near term should attract more investor interest.

Title: Companies are going hardcore. It means one classic piece of career advice is getting more crucial.

Time Published: 2025-05-10T08:04:01Z

A few big companies have been in the news for cutting underperformers and rewarding high performers. If you're looking to advance your career or keep your job in an increasingly frozen job market, you should take advantage of the classic advice to document your work wins and accomplishments. Keeping track of your performance can be crucial to getting a raise or a promotion, and for job security. Microsoft and Meta have made performance-related job cuts. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported that "Amazon is revising its compensation structure within pay bands to better recognize and reward long-term high performers." Emily Field, a partner in McKinsey & Company's people and organizational performance practice, said performance management tends to follow economic and talent cycles. Companies were more relaxed about it during the pandemic and the Great Resignation, when workers were quitting their jobs en masse. But now the Great Resignation is over, hiring has cooled, layoffs are still low, and more workers are staying put. That more static labor market could mean demonstrating your value at work can be even more important to get promoted or to try to protect your role from layoffs. "What we're seeing is, particularly with AI, particularly with economic headwinds, we're seeing organizations say, we need to focus on high performance to be able to win, to be able to innovate, to be able to beat our competitors, and therefore we need to focus on performance management," Field said. Below is advice on how to document your wins, who needs to see them, and how often you should be discussing performance. Amy Lentz, the founder of Hack Your HR and chief people officer of footwear company Toms, said, "If you are creating value in your job, I think it's important to document," Lentz said. "Where people get kind of hung up is, 'Well, what is success and how do I measure it?'" Vicki Salemi, a career expert for Monster, said if a company is figuring out layoffs and their budget, workers need to also think of their job in terms of numbers. "They're thinking about in terms of your wins, but also money saved, time saved as well as money earned, time earned in terms of efficiencies, streamlining," Salemi said. Field said it's always been important to have quantifiable metrics. But in today's economy, "it's even more important to be able to say, this is how I'm contributing to the organization's success." Salemi said not all companies have quantitative performance ratings because they are having ongoing conversations about performance and don't think there needs to be a formal process. "In that case, it may be harder for you to show that you're a strong performer if they don't go by metrics," she said. Salemi said to focus on what you can do to be a good employee, including whether you are hitting or exceeding goals and expectations. If you are worried about layoffs, Salemi said to ask your boss what you need to do differently or what you need to prioritize. "That shows engagement, that shows that you care, and that you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work and hopefully get honest, helpful feedback," Salemi said. "Your boss might say, 'It's the company. It's not you.'" Lentz said documented wins should be measurable, objective, and factual, and less about your perception of that success. She said to document what you did, the outcome, and how it brought value. Salemi said to get in the habit of quantifying what you do because this can also be helpful if you apply for a new job. Salemi added that you can also document work testimonials and feedback you have received. Salemi suggested workers document their success in real time, even if it's just a note on their phones that they can refer back to. However, she advised against showing them to your boss after every success. "You do need to do that periodically and when it matters," Salemi said, adding that a good time to do so is during your organization's review of salaries, after a big project, or overcoming some work hurdles. Lentz suggested making a document that you can add to and share with your boss, arguing that it could be more effective than just tracking everything in a single annual review. Field said setting goals is important for documenting successes. She said to have check-ins with your manager because your priorities and what you need to deliver on might change over time. Lentz suggested asking in your one-on-one meeting with your boss for a conversation in the next few months about goals and how to spend your time, so you can understand if you are working on what is of value at the company. Salemi suggested asking your boss if they have a minute to discuss how to be rated as exceptional at the company this year and what metrics they need to see from you. Salemi said even if your boss isn't numbers-focused, you need to include figures in your documentation because your manager won't be the only one evaluating your performance. She added that it can also be important if you are considering an internal job switch. "The first thing that potential new boss is going to do is they'll want to see your performance review," Salemi said. "It's important to highlight your wins and that means including numbers." Are you a leader who can talk about layoffs, uncertainty, or performance management at your company? Reach out to this reporter to share at mhoff@businessinsider.com. Jump to

Title: Marx wasn't entirely wrong on the lay of capitalism; he was just early

Full Content:
Karl Marx described a world of two main classes: those who owned the means of production (the bourgeoisie), and those who sold their labor to survive (the proletariat). His vision reflected the industrial world of the 19th century—factories, landlords, and mass labor. Today, we live in a world of startups, social media, and digital nomads. It might seem like 'class' is obsolete. But when we peel back the layers, we find that class, as he saw it, never disappeared — it just changed form. So what counts as ownership today? In Marx's time, ownership meant factories, land, and physical infrastructure. Today, it's code, platforms, patents, and data. The owners are no longer factory tycoons; they are tech moguls. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta don't just sell products — they own the channels through which digital life flows. These platforms are the modern means of production. If you want to reach customers, communicate, work, or learn, you often do it through their systems. This control gives them immense leverage. They extract fees, set rules, harvest data, and shape behavior — not just through economics, but through algorithmic influence. They don't just benefit from the market — they define it. It’s true that anyone can start a business today. Anyone can code, freelance, or build an audience. And some people do rise: Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others began with modest means and built empires. But these are rare stories. Most founders fail. Most people lack the capital, networks, and insulation to survive repeated failure. Success often comes not from a single stroke of genius but from persistence, timing, and the ability to fail safely. In other words, the field may appear open, but it isn’t level. A few make it. Many don’t. And even among those who “succeed,” control often passes to the investors and platform owners behind the curtain. The modern ladder still exists — but it’s taller, slipperier, and guarded by gatekeepers with venture capital. If Marx's class model still applies, how do we translate it to today? The bourgeoisie are now the platform owners: the founders, VCs, and institutional investors who control the infrastructure. The petty bourgeoisie are creators, startup founders, and engineers with some equity. They have partial control, but they’re vulnerable to policy shifts and market forces. The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass—spam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they’re governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn’t disappeared — it’s been digitized. The so-called “tech middle class” is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don’t control. A change in TikTok’s algorithm, YouTube’s payout structure, or Apple’s App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old — shopkeepers, artisans, and traders — they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx’s time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality — though now dressed in tech jargon — is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We’re no longer marching on factory floors. We’re negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right? Perhaps on his initial analysis. He couldn’t foresee the internet, social media, or SaaS. But he understood something timeless: when a small group owns the tools of production—whether they’re factories or platforms — they will shape the world in their favor. No, we don’t need to embrace communism to admit this. But we should be honest about how capitalism concentrates power. And if we value real opportunity, we should focus less on hustle culture and more on who owns the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Class isn’t about who’s rich and who’s not. It’s about who controls the systems. Most of us still don’t. Until we do, Marx isn’t irrelevant — he’s just updated. Thien Ooi is an engineer who works in the tech field. Image: Wikimedia Commons, via Picryl // public domain Karl Marx described a world of two main classes: those who owned the means of production (the bourgeoisie), and those who sold their labor to survive (the proletariat). His vision reflected the industrial world of the 19th century—factories, landlords, and mass labor. Today, we live in a world of startups, social media, and digital nomads. It might seem like 'class' is obsolete. But when we peel back the layers, we find that class, as he saw it, never disappeared — it just changed form. So what counts as ownership today? In Marx's time, ownership meant factories, land, and physical infrastructure. Today, it's code, platforms, patents, and data. The owners are no longer factory tycoons; they are tech moguls. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta don't just sell products — they own the channels through which digital life flows. These platforms are the modern means of production. If you want to reach customers, communicate, work, or learn, you often do it through their systems. This control gives them immense leverage. They extract fees, set rules, harvest data, and shape behavior — not just through economics, but through algorithmic influence. They don't just benefit from the market — they define it. It’s true that anyone can start a business today. Anyone can code, freelance, or build an audience. And some people do rise: Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others began with modest means and built empires. But these are rare stories. Most founders fail. Most people lack the capital, networks, and insulation to survive repeated failure. Success often comes not from a single stroke of genius but from persistence, timing, and the ability to fail safely. In other words, the field may appear open, but it isn’t level. A few make it. Many don’t. And even among those who “succeed,” control often passes to the investors and platform owners behind the curtain. The modern ladder still exists — but it’s taller, slipperier, and guarded by gatekeepers with venture capital. If Marx's class model still applies, how do we translate it to today? The bourgeoisie are now the platform owners: the founders, VCs, and institutional investors who control the infrastructure. The petty bourgeoisie are creators, startup founders, and engineers with some equity. They have partial control, but they’re vulnerable to policy shifts and market forces. The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass—spam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they’re governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn’t disappeared — it’s been digitized. The so-called “tech middle class” is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don’t control. A change in TikTok’s algorithm, YouTube’s payout structure, or Apple’s App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old — shopkeepers, artisans, and traders — they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx’s time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality — though now dressed in tech jargon — is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We’re no longer marching on factory floors. We’re negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right?
