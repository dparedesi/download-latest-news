Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surging to $97,852 on Binance. The cryptocurrency is up 5% in the last 24 hours and has gained an impressive 43% over the past 16 days since November 5. The momentum shows no signs of slowing as BTC price continues its steady ascent. Several key factors are driving this remarkable rally: Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, market sentiment has shifted significantly. The initial “Trump trade” has evolved into the “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade,” fueled by speculation that President-elect Trump may establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). This follows his pledge at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Industry insiders like David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and a Trump campaign advisor, and Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, have hinted at the possibility of the SBR becoming a reality. Both have urged that the SBR be established within the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency through an executive order. They warn of the United States potentially falling behind in the global race to accumulate BTC. Bailey revealed on November 9, “There is at least one nation-state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” He emphasized his certainty with a meme, indicating his information is based on knowledge rather than speculation. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, confirmed in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that “countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes.” The “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade” is expected to continue until Trump’s inauguration on January 20. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on his promises, potentially moving over 208,000 BTC confiscated by law enforcement into the reserve or even adopting Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act proposal to purchase 1 million BTC over five years. A leak on Wednesday suggests that President-elect Trump’s team is in discussions about creating a new White House position dedicated solely to Bitcoin and crypto policy. Sources familiar with the transition efforts indicate that candidates are being vetted for this role. If established, it would be the first-ever Bitcoin and crypto-specific White House position, underscoring the influence the nascent industry stands to wield in the incoming administration. It is unclear whether the role will be a senior White House staff position or a “crypto czar” overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government. Crypto industry advocates are pushing for the role to have a direct line to Trump – a massive news for the entire industry. The introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has had a significant impact on the market. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) ETF options, launched on November 19, 2024, saw an unprecedented $1.9 billion in notional exposure on their first day of trading. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart stated, “Final tally of IBIT’s 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts. That’s a ratio of 4.4:1. These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new Bitcoin all-time highs today.” Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, recently highlighted the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options: With the approval by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin ETF options, we are on the verge of witnessing the most extraordinary upside ‘vol’ of ‘vol’ in financial history. For the first time, Bitcoin’s notional value will be ‘fractionally banked’ with ETF options. This marks the most monumental advancement possible for the crypto market. Park explained that Bitcoin ETF options provide a regulated market where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects clearing members from counterparty risks, allowing Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure to grow exponentially. He emphasized that this could lead to an explosive recursive effect on Bitcoin’s price due to unique volatility characteristics and the “volatility smile.” If there were one thing to read today re the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options, read (and bookmark) this one for 2025 – it’s going to be wild. pic.twitter.com/On2DmUsbHX — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) September 20, 2024 The latest rally has also been driven by significant activity in the spot market. Heavy spot bids have propelled the price higher, with yesterday’s BTC ETF inflows being a crucial factor. Inflows amounted to $773.4 million, with BlackRock contributing $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million, Bitwise $9.2 million, and ARK Invest $3.8 million. Over the past three days, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have purchased a staggering $1.856 billion worth of Bitcoin. Good morning, Yesterday’s Bitcoin ETF flows were positive for $773.4 million. Blackrock did $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million. (BTC the mini-ETF is still missing data) Price slowly climbing higher from $92K up to $97k now. Shitcoins are getting slaughtered. source:… pic.twitter.com/WMYIj7WiYj — WhalePanda (@WhalePanda) November 21, 2024 The total net asset value of US Bitcoin spot ETFs has exceeded $100 billion. Twelve Bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, were issued in January and have reached this milestone in just ten months. At press time, BTC traded at $96,920.

There aren’t attractive investment deals in the clean energy sector right now, especially in emerging and developing markets, the executive told Bloomberg, declining to go into details how much the fund has spent over the past year. The UAE, a major oil producer in the Middle East, launched Alterra at the COP28 summit in Dubai last year. The fund’s goals are to “drive forward international efforts to create a fairer climate finance system, with an emphasis on improving access to funding for the Global South.” With $30 billion committed, Alterra became the world’s largest private investment vehicle for climate change action. The fund has stated its goal to mobilize as much as $250 billion globally by 2030 and help bridge the gap in investment into the solutions needed to keep the world on the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway, drive investment into the Global South, and create new investment opportunities and strategies for emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). In collaboration with BlackRock, Brookfield, and TPG as inaugural launch partners, Alterra has so far committed $6.5 billion to climate-dedicated funds for global investments. However, the actual money spent on funds is significantly lower than this initial commitment, Alterra’s CEO Majid Al Suwaidi told Bloomberg in Azerbaijan, which is currently hosting the COP29 climate summit. The project financing of energy transition projects is often complicated because of the mix of public and private investments needed. According to Alterra’s Al Suwaidi, it is difficult to mobilize financing from the public sector, which is often experiencing financial troubles, while private investors and banks are averse to taking a lot of risk.

Title: ASML Remains A Valid Medium-Term Investment Despite Weak Outlook
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/21/asml-remains-a-valid-medium-term-investment-despite-weak-outlook/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T16:08:27Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

Title: Bitcoin Price Cements New All-Time High Above $98,000 As Traders Eye Landmark Six-Figure Price

Bitcoin is on a roll — again. Bitcoin’s stratospheric rise continues, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency spiking to new heights on Thursday as an upsurge catalyzed by former president Donald Trump’s win earlier this month continued. The $100,000-per-BTC psychologically important mark is now just a stone’s throw away. Bitcoin rose to as high as $98,310.57 earlier today, CoinGecko data shows. At this level, BTC is roughly 2% from the much-anticipated $100,000 milestone that would drive it above a $2 trillion market cap. Bitcoin has gained roughly 46% over the past month, propelled by bullish sentiment across digital assets and broader equities following President-elect Donald Trump’s successful return bid for the Oval Office on Nov. 6. Industry participants have dubbed the parabolic rally the “Trump Trade,” as all assets, including equities, bonds, and digital currencies, have surged since Trump defeated Kamala Harris. Traders view Trump’s win as a favorable environment, providing a clear runway for deregulation and business-friendly policies to spur continued rallies into next year. For crypto, Trump’s administration is expected to drive regulation designed to establish a domestic Bitcoin reserve, safeguard crypto mining interests, end the current administration’s hostile regulatory stance, and foster innovation. In fact, the President-elect’s team is reportedly planning to create a position focused on crypto policy, which would be a first for the White House, according to Bloomberg. The team is assessing potential candidates to serve in that role. The unprecedented demand for the newly launched BlackRock IBIT options, which track BTC prices and are poised to dramatically increase liquidity in the market, has also added to the latest bullish momentum. On Nov. 19, the first day of trading on the Nasdaq, the new options contracts recorded nearly $2 billion in notional exposure traded on its first day, as ZyCrypto reported. Bitcoin is now on track to surpass $100,000 in the coming one or two months, as observed by MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe. Up 3.2% on the day, Bitcoin is less than $3,000 from the historic six-figure achievement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trader Bitcoin Munger shared a Glassnode chart on X showing massive accumulation across all cohorts, noting that BTC is likely to “blow way past” $100,000.

Title: McCanns win votes to take Balmoral private amid cries of ‘corporate greed’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/11/21/mccanns-win-votes-to-take-balmoral-private-amid-cries-of-corporate-greed/

A move by the McCann family, once synonymous with Fyffes, to take Balmoral International Land fully private secured backing at an extraordinary general meeting (egm) on Thursday, even as some small shareholders vented ire as they face being squeezed out under the deal. Almost 98 per cent of voting shareholders, led by McCann-controlled vehicles that already own just over 61 per cent of the stock, cast in favour of a mandatory buyback of stock held by investors holding fewer than 25,000 shares. These account for a combined 22.4 per cent stake in the company and many of them did not vote. The transaction will increase the direct McCann family stakes and indirect holdings, through vehicles they control, to a combined 79 per cent. It is being priced at €10.50 a share, 44 per cent below Balmoral’s most recent reported net asset value per share of €18.72. While it marks a 110 per cent premium to where the shares traded on the grey market last November – before stockbrokers stopped openly facilitating trades due to the burden of paperwork – it is below the €12 level at which a block of over 16,000 shares changed hands last week. That was the first reported trade in 12 months. It is not clear who handled that trade. Colm Whooley, a small shareholder, described the transaction as “corporate greed” at the sometimes tense egm in Dublin. “Balmoral is now a healthy company. There is no justification for the [44] per cent discount to take us out,” he said. “It’s not a company in distress or any difficulty.” Another of four investors to speak – out of about 15 small shareholders that turned up to the meeting – questioned why the company, whose €5 million of administration costs last year equated to 52 per cent of gross rental income, did not opt to sell off its assets instead. He noted that much of Balmoral’s investment assets comprise industrial and warehouse buildings which have outperformed the wider commercial property market in recent years. Balmoral chairman Carl McCann said the €10.50 price was higher than a share redemption price suggested by Davy, the board’s financial adviser, and reflects how most listed property stocks are currently trading at deep discounts to NAV (net asset value). He said the notion of a break-up of the company “wouldn’t be appealing” to directors and other large investors who took a risk committing fresh capital to refinance the business following the financial crisis. “It’s a miracle for the company to be here today,” he said. He suggested take-private deals over the past five years of property companies Green Reit, Hibernian Reit and Yew Grove Reit, each at a slight premium to NAV, would each likely be priced at a deep discount if they took place today. However, some of the vocal investors countered that NAVs across the sector have already declined in recent years, amid a spike in interest rates and other factors. The company was originally named Blackrock International Land when it was spun out by Fyffes in 2006 as a separate publicly-quoted entity. It was delisted in 2011 following a slump in its share price during the property crash, but continues to have thousands of legacy shareholders that have remained on board since the stock market exit. The McCann family sold their decades-held shares in Fyffes in 2017 to Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. The Tokyo-based firm subsequently sold the 30 per cent interest in Balmoral it inherited to a vehicle led by the McCanns. Mr McCann is also executive chairman of Dole Plc, the Irish-based but New York-listed fresh produce company created in 2021 through the merger of Dole Foods with former Total Produce. Dole and Fyffes are among Balmoral’s main tenants. The fair value of Balmoral’s investment assets, comprised of industrial and warehouse buildings, offices and mixed-use land, edged up to €146.3 million in June from €138 million in December, the company disclosed in a circular in October.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.26%) shares made a slight recovery at the market open on Thursday, before reversing and continuing its fall during after-hours and pre-market trading. The chipmaker’s shares were down by around 1.2% on Thursday morning but had climbed over 4% at the open. Nvidia’s stock was down by around 1% during pre-market trading on Thursday.

The company set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, but was expected to set guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet (FDS+0.31%) estimates.

Millions of young Americans are forging unconventional paths to early retirement amid a growing desire for financial freedom and greater flexibility in spending their time. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the percentage of people willing to work full-time after age 62 fell to 45.8% in March, compared to 55% in March 2014. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share How are young investors using dividend investing for early retirement? Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000. Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence. Let's take a look at the stocks and funds in the portfolio. Aberdeen Income Credit Strategies Fund Shares: 7,364.77 Annual Income: $8,837.73 Aberdeen Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP) is a closed-ended fund that generates income by investing in loan and debt instruments. It is risky because ACP invests at least 80% of its managed assets in a mix of senior loans, including below-investment-grade or "junk" securities. The fund has a distribution rate of approximately 18%. YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF Shares: 143.90 Annual Income: $750.95 YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY) generates income by selling call options on AI-related stocks or indexes. The fund has a distribution rate of 108%. Its secondary objective is to seek share price growth by tracking C3.ai, whose shares are down 7.6% this year, while AIYY is down 55%.

FAGIX is a high-yield fund exposed to below-investment-grade quality bonds, junk bonds and equities. It is up about 10% so far this year and has a yield of about 5%. The investor collected $8,130 a year from his investment in the fund. Fidelity Floating Rate High Income Fund Shares: 25,329.74 Annual Income: $18,863.56 The Fidelity Floating Rate High Income Fund (FFRHX) primarily invests in floating-rate loans and other floating-rate securities issued by companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings. The fund has a dividend yield of about 8%. According to the portfolio screenshots he shared publicly on Reddit, the investor earning $61,600 per year or $5,130 per month in dividends owned about 25,329 shares of the fund. Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio Shares: 1,657.05 Annual Income: $2,820.29 Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) invests in companies that design, manufacture or sell semiconductors. The investor who collected about $5,130 per month in dividends had 1,657 shares of the fund in his portfolio.

Millions of young Americans are forging unconventional paths to early retirement amid a growing desire for financial freedom and greater flexibility in spending their time. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the percentage of people willing to work full-time after age 62 fell to 45.8% in March, compared to 55% in March 2014.

Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000. Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Are Return-To-Office Mandates About Efficiency Or Cutting Costs?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2024/11/21/are-return-to-office-mandates-about-efficiency-or-cutting-costs/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Trying to find a balance isn't getting any easier. The Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental governing body headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is taking on remote work for government employees. The move by DOGE to reduce the federal workforce pushes back on remote work—especially if government workers quit as a result of the initiative. While 18% of the Fortune 500 companies require 100% full-time in-office work, it’s no secret that removing remote work as an option is reducing the workforce. A survey by BambooHR found that a quarter of VP and C-suite executives and a fifth of HR pros admitted to hoping for voluntary turnover after implementing a return-to-office policy. Is the push against remote work a strategy for low-cost layoffs, reducing an over-bloated workforce? Or, as the Wall Street Journal reports, is it an initiative designed to drive efficiency, collaboration and growth? Making plans for the future of work. Workers want remote options now more than ever, according to a survey from Buffer. According to the report, 98% of respondents would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Gallup polling found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term”, according to CNN reports. The Daily Mail says that not a single U.S. federal agency had over 50% office space utilization between January and December2023. Consider the cost of carrying that underused real estate on the taxpayers’ balance sheet. Underutilized real estate is part of the reason for the push against remote work. Consider office vacancies in cities like Salesforce, with iconic addresses in downtown San Francisco, New York, Indianapolis and other cities, issued a return to work policy that made headlines. San Francisco and Austin (the two top cities for unused commercial real estate, both tied at 27.7% vacancies, according to CommercialEdge) are cities struggling with utilization. While employees may howl at the mandates, companies have the right (and the shareholder responsibility) to maximize their assets. RTO is the battlefront of utilization, in the push against remote work. Here is a partial list of companies that have fully ended remote work, according to Tech.co: Justification of expenses is a challenge for any organization. Consider that, in a recent survey, 23% of workers at the Department of Commerce (that’s the government entity that handles business in the US) were found to be overpaid - because they did not tell their employer that they had moved to a less expensive area to work remote. Deception, not remote work, is the real issue here. But consider the possibilities, for workers. If given the choice while making the same salary: would you rather live in Abilene, Texas or the Washington, DC metro area? (That’s a cost of living difference of 56.42%, if you are curious). Flexibility and work-life balance are important to today’s workforce. The ability to live where you want, avoiding commutes and urban costs, can be a big advantage for your bottom line - and your family time. Ultimately, the reason any business organization exists is to return shareholder value. For many leaders today, RTO (return to office) mandates are becoming more common - because companies are working in their shareholders’ (or constituents’) best interests. For employees, those interests may require sacrifice: increasing time in the office...or increasing time in the job search. As Charles Dickens said, “Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?” That question seems to lie at the center of the push against remote work. Ultimately, work requires sacrifice - that’s why it’s called work. Time and talents are traded for salary and benefits. Reaching an equitable and fair equation in the workplace is the employment conflict of the ages. Or is that the “conflict of the wages”? Employment at will means that employers can dictate the terms. Employees decide where and how they work. But choices today are limited, tipping the scales in favor of employers. On the battleground of the labor market, only 12,000 new jobs were created in November 2024 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). And Bamboo reports that 70% of companies plan on increasing the required time in the office. For workers, both economic growth and labor force growth are on a declining trend. When choices are limited, workers must make difficult decisions. Those decisions center on what sacrifices are acceptable, and do-able, in the push against remote work. One Community. Many Voices.

In a remarkable display of market confidence, Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) Inc., the company renowned for its law enforcement technology, has achieved an all-time high, with its stock price soaring to $627.67. This milestone underscores a period of significant growth for the company, which has seen an impressive 172.34% increase over the past year. Investors have rallied behind Axon's innovative product line and strategic market positioning, propelling the stock to new heights and reflecting a robust demand for the company's offerings in the public safety sector. The 1-year change data not only highlights the company's strong performance but also suggests a bullish outlook among investors for Axon's future. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise Inc. reported a strong third-quarter performance during its earnings call, with a 32% year-over-year increase in Q3 revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.7%. The company's record bookings for Q3 surpassed $1 billion, demonstrating continued momentum. Axon's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and TASER products, including the TASER 10, has contributed to its success and potential for international expansion. The integration of its recent acquisition, Dedrone, along with the launch of new AI-driven products, has led to Axon raising its Q4 revenue guidance to $560-570 million and projecting its full-year revenue to exceed $2.07 billion. Despite a slight deceleration in software and annual recurring revenue growth due to timing and seasonality, Axon remains optimistic about its future. These developments are recent and illustrate Axon's commitment to enhancing public safety through technology and innovation. Axon Enterprise's recent stock performance aligns with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization has reached an impressive $47.41 billion, reflecting its strong position in the law enforcement technology sector. InvestingPro data shows that Axon's revenue growth remains robust, with a 32.32% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a 31.7% quarterly growth in Q3 2024. This growth trajectory supports the stock's remarkable 166.97% price return over the past year. InvestingPro Tips highlight Axon's financial strength, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and "liquid assets exceed short-term obligations." These factors contribute to Axon's financial stability and ability to invest in future growth. Additionally, the tip that "analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year" aligns with the company's recent performance and market optimism. It's worth noting that Axon is trading near its 52-week high, with the current price at 97.6% of that peak. While this indicates strong investor confidence, the InvestingPro Tip that the "RSI suggests the stock is in overbought territory" may warrant caution for potential investors. For those seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 23 additional tips on Axon Enterprise, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Title: Ireland v Fiji team news: Gus McCarthy, Cormac Izuchukwu and Sam Prendergast all start
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/21/ireland-v-fiji-team-news-gus-mccarthy-cormac-izuchukwu-and-sam-prendergast-all-start/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T13:58:18Z
Full Content:
As forecast, Andy Farrell has given Test debuts to the 21-year-old Leinster hooker Gus McCarthy and the 24-year-old Ulster flanker Cormac Izuchukwu in making seven changes to the Ireland starting line-up for Saturday’s Autumn Nations Series game against Fiji at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm). One of those additional changes will see Sam Prendergast make his full Test debut after playing the last 18 minutes of Ireland’s 22-19 win over Argentina last Friday. Jamie Osborne, who made his international debut when seamlessly replacing Hugo Keenan for both Tests last summer in South Africa, returns at fullback after winning his third and fourth caps with eye-catching displays off the bench in midfield against the All Blacks and Los Pumas. Jacob Stockdale has been rewarded for his try-scoring form in an Ulster jersey with a recall on the left wing to earn his 38th cap and his first since Ireland’s final World Cup warm-up game against Samoa in Bayonne, while Bundee Aki also returns to midfield, with Robbie Henshaw shifting to outside centre. Craig Casey, who started the first Test in South Africa before being ruled out of the second due to a head injury, starts at scrumhalf, while McCarthy and Izuchukwu are the two changes in personnel up front, with Tadhg Beirne reverting to the secondrow in a positional switch. Save for the retention of Thomas Clarkson, one of two debutants last week, it is a completely rejigged bench, with Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Conor Murray, Ciarán Frawley and Stuart McCloskey all returning. So too does the Connacht captain Cian Prendergast, who is in line to win his fourth cap and first since the World Cup warm-up win over England, thus ensuring a memorable day for himself, his younger brother and his family. Mindful that Ireland have undertaken a fourth November game against Australia on Saturday week, Farrell has rested Keenan, Garry Ringrose, James Lowe, Jack Crowley, Jamison Gibson-Park and James Ryan, while Cian Healy will have to wait another week to eclipse Brian O’Driscoll as Ireland’s most capped player of all time. The 21-year-old McCarthy, a product of Blackrock College, was captain of the Ireland Under-20 side which won the Grand Slam and reached the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Cape Town two seasons ago, with Prendergast the team’s star turn. McCarthy has been exposed to plenty of rugby this season, due to injuries for Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher, and has backed up his dynamic and mobile performances on the Emerging Ireland tour in September by impressing the Irish coaches at training in this November window. Born in London to an Irish mother and Nigerian father, Izuchukwu started playing in Tullamore RFC and has made a rapid rise since the latter stages of last season. After completing his Leaving Cert cycle in Roscrea College, Izuchukwu had notions of travelling the world playing rugby. But a video compilation of his highlight reels while playing with Kelso in Scotland was sent to Anthony Eddy and he brought Izuchukwu into the Ireland Sevens fold, which in turn led to a place in the Ulster academy. Given a run of games by Richie Murphy toward the end of last season, Izuchukwu caught the eye with his ball-carrying and athleticism, and also impressed the Irish coaches on his second Emerging Ireland tour. “Izzy has been in and around the squad now for a while actually. The first Emerging Ireland is when we first came across his ability, his athleticism,” said Farrell. “The difference between the first [Emerging Ireland] tour and the second tour was chalk and cheese. His ability, point of difference, his potential with that maturity, he deserves a shot to show what he’s got. “Gus, what a rise in such a short space of time,” added Farrell of McCarthy, and citing the maturity that came with captaining the Irish Under-20s, albeit he was first named in this November squad as a training panellist. “But rugby is a strange thing. You think there’s a pecking order and all of a sudden, a couple of players get an injury then a kid gets an opportunity, and he shows up really well when we take him on the training week with us as a development player. He showed up unbelievably well and he’s forced our arm to keep him in the squad, first and foremost. And he deserves a shot to see what he can do as well.” As ever, Farrell was also bullish about Sam Prendergast’s potential. “I’m confident from what we’ve seen. We took him on the Emerging tour and he played in all of those games and the aim of that was for him to grab hold of that team and make sure that he treated it like his own as though he was in charge. He did that in spades and this week we’ve seen the benefit of that. We need to see it transfer obviously. “His character is composed, he is confident but yet not over-confident. He’s assertive in what he wants, and he has a nice way in how he goes about his business.” Farrell said he would encourage Frawley to be himself, adding: “He’s super excited that he gets another chance to right the wrongs of a couple of weeks ago and we’re excited about seeing him play because he’s a top-quality player.” As for Stockdale, the Irish coach said: “He’s chomping at the bit and this is his chance to show us what he’s about at this level again.” It’s been a frustrating month so far for Tadhh Furlong, who still hasn’t recovered from his hamstring strain. “He’s tried his best,” said Farrell. “I feel for him. It’s been tough because everyone is desperate to play for Ireland and he’s worked really hard to try and get back there and we were hoping it was going to be this week. You’re always trying to push on to the next stage and get through that and he didn’t quite manage that.” IRELAND (v Fiji): Jamie Osborne (Leinster); Mack Hansen (Connacht), Robbie Henshaw (Leinster), Bundee Aki (Connacht), Jacob Stockdale (Ulster); Sam Prendergast (Leinster), Craig Casey (Munster); Andrew Porter (Leinster), Gus McCarthy (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht); Joe McCarthy (Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Munster); Cormac Izuchukwu (Ulster), Josh van der Flier (Leinster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt).

Title: Is Bioceres Crop Solutions (BIOX) the Best Fertilizer Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) stands against the other fertilizer stocks. The fertilizer industry is a crucial sector in agriculture that focuses on the production and distribution of substances that enhance plant growth. By supplying necessary nutrients, fertilizers help improve crop yields and quality, which are essential for feeding the growing global population. The industry has evolved significantly over time, with modern practices relying heavily on chemically manufactured fertilizers to support large-scale farming and meet the global demand for food. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market is estimated to have reached a value of $381.7 billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.99% during 2024-2030 to reach $541.2 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Right Now. There is a strong sense of optimism within the industry. The Fertilizer Institute’s 2023 Industry Trends Survey highlighted a positive outlook within the fertilizer sector, with many respondents expressing confidence in future growth. About 40% of those surveyed believe that market conditions have improved over the past five years, despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Companies attribute their resilience to strategic practices such as precommitment purchases and careful planning. Nearly 80% of participants are optimistic about their businesses being equally or more profitable in the next five years. The fertilizer industry is currently experiencing several key trends that are shaping its future. Advances in technology are transforming how fertilizers are produced and applied. Innovations such as precision agriculture, which uses data analytics and sensors, help farmers optimize fertilizer usage based on specific soil conditions and crop needs. Additionally, there is a growing demand for fertilizers that offer more nutrients while reducing their environmental impact. The emphasis on maximizing the efficiency of fertilizer application to promote sustainable farming practices is increasing, which is driving the development of new and innovative solutions. On August 13, CNBC reported that Windfall Bio, a California-based startup, is addressing methane emissions using "mems," or methane-eating microbes. These microbes naturally consume methane and convert it into fertilizer. This innovative approach helps reduce harmful methane from sources like agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Farmers can use the fertilizer produced, while companies generating waste methane can sell it back to Windfall, creating a new revenue stream. These trends indicate a dynamic shift in the fertilizer industry, balancing the need for increased food production with environmental sustainability and innovation. To compile our list of the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest fertilizer companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best fertilizer stocks. We carefully verified our list to remove any companies that can not be classified as fertilizer stocks. From an initial pool of over 15 fertilizer stocks, we focused on the stocks that analysts believe possess the greatest potential for growth. Finally, we ranked the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now based on their average price target upside potential according to analysts, as of November 18, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A farmer in a field, inspecting freshly planted crop seeds using advanced biotechnological tools. Average Upside Potential According to Analysts: 113.82% Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) is a key player in the agriculture industry that provides solutions to enhance crop yields and promote sustainable practices. The company offers a range of products, including patented seed technologies and microbial agricultural inputs. Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) Crop Nutrition segment features innovative solutions like nitrogen-fixing biologicals, micro-beaded fertilizers, and biofertilizers. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) reported revenues of $93.3 million, down from $116.6 million in the same quarter last year. This decline was largely due to a slow start to the summer crop planting season in Argentina, affected by adverse weather conditions. The sales of micro-beaded fertilizers in Argentina faced challenges due to an unexpected change where more corn land was converted to soybeans. However, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) experienced growth in North America and Brazil, demonstrating the effectiveness of its geographic diversification strategy to manage risks associated with weather fluctuations. In Q1 2025, a notable achievement for the company was the regulatory approval of its HB4 technology for soybean production in Uruguay and Bolivia. This expands the company’s market and positions it well for future growth. Additionally, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) announced that the company’s RinoTec technology received the EPA's Green Chemistry Challenge Award, reinforcing their commitment to environmentally friendly practices. Despite recent challenges, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) has shown strong growth over the past five years with an average annual revenue growth rate of 21%. Analysts are also optimistic about BIOX, holding a consensus buy rating with a one-year price target suggesting a potential upside of 113% from current levels. Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) stands out as a promising investment in the fertilizer sector due to its innovative product offerings, strategic market expansion, and commitment to sustainability. Overall BIOX ranks 1st on our list of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.

Title: What’s Happening With Google Stock?

Time Published: 2024-11-21T13:22:25Z
Full Content:
The Google logo displays on a smartphone screen in Reno, United States, on November 15, 2024. (Photo ... [+] by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been in the news lately, with the Department of Justice suggesting the sale of Google Chrome, and sharing data with rivals, among other measures to end its monopoly. The judge has set the trial on proposals for April 2025. Google will be given a chance to present its own proposals in December. [1] It was known that Google is facing antitrust cases and the remedies could be as extreme as selling the android platform. This overhang has also weighed on GOOG stock performance lately. Looking at a slightly longer period, GOOG stock has seen a 23% rise from levels of $144 in early 2022 to $177 now. This can primarily be attributed to: Google’s revenue growth over the recent years has been driven by its cloud business, which is seeing a strong momentum, with the segment sales surging a solid 72% between 2021 and 2023. However, its contribution of 11% to the company’s total sales is much smaller than 56% for its Google search business. The core search business is also doing well, with the company’s AI integration helping it to garner higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue in the near term. Looking at the latest quarter, Google’s revenue of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did the company see strong revenue growth, its profitability has improved. Alphabet’s operating income rose 34% from $79 billion in 2021 to $105 billion now. Its operating margin has improved slightly from 30.6% in 2021 to 30.9% in the last twelve months. With 26% gains this year, GOOG stock has fared marginally better than the broader S&P500 index, up 24%. However, the increase in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and Google’s antitrust case, could GOOG face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think its stock price appears to be fairly priced. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, broadly aligning with its current levels of $178. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 25x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. Now, Google has a monopoly with 90% of searches. The recent argument by prosecutors focused on the company’s search engine – Chrome – which is a widely used browser with over 3 billion users. Chrome is very important for Google, given that it acts as a gateway through which users access the search engine. The web browser alone could be worth as much as $20 billion. [2] Furthermore, the prosecutors stated that Google should share data it gathers from users with competitors. And, if the remedies fail to increase the competition, then Google should consider selling Android. None of these remedies would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term. Separately, check out a company that could benefit from a potential weight loss drug shortage in What’s Happening With HIMS Stock?

However, these advertisements have not been well-received on social media.

US stock futures climbed on Thursday, reversing earlier premarket losses as investors dug into Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and lackluster revenue forecast for insights into the prospects for AI-fueled growth. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) led the gains, up 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) added 0.3%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) put on 0.1%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chip making. amid questions about the future of the AI boom. Nvidia's shares were down around 1% in premarket trading, recovering from a deeper drop earlier Thursday morning, as investors debated the future of the AI boom. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares edged lower after the DOJ asked a judge to force its Google unit to sell off its Chrome browser. But its antitrust team held off on Android, laying out a choice between divesting the mobile operating system business or adopting stringent remedies. Weekly jobless claims due later Thursday will give the market insight into the labor market as they weigh the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest-rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury Secretary pick, as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed 5% to a fresh all-time high above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the "Trump trade," as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the the pre-market. From top to bottom, Target's results flat out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target could deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN). This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." Below I list out several of the challenges Target is up against. Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the pre-market after earnings last night. Makes sense as Jensen didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high-end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps production of its latest AI chip Blackwell. Usually during ramp periods costs are elevated, and profit margins not at peak levels. Notes Keybanc analyst John Vinh: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Notes Keybanc analyst John Vinh: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Nvidia (NVDA) is retaining its title as the darling of the A.I. revolution—at least for the time being. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker reported record revenue yesterday (Nov. 20) for the July-September quarter that surpassed Wall Street’s already lofty expectations. Demand for Nvidia’s A.I. chips continues soaring, according to the company’s CEO Jensen Huang. “The age of A.I. is upon us and it’s large and diverse,” said Huang during an earnings call.

Before the A.I. boom, Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) were most used by the gaming industry. Today, the company’s data center business, which serves mostly A.I. clients, accounts for nearly 90 percent of its total revenue, bringing in $30.7 billion for the quarter compared with $14.5 billion last year. Gaming revenue, meanwhile, totaled at $3.2 billion. The rest of the company’s sales came from its automotive and professional visualization departments. Huang said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs, which began shipping this month, “is very strong” and production is “in full steam.” In recent months, Nvidia has struggled to meet demand for its Hopper chips. Despite a blowout quarter, Nvidia’s share price slipped nearly 2 percent after the earnings release. Some investors were spooked by the chipmaker’s $37.5 billion revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, which would represent a slowdown in the rapid growth witnessed during past quarters. The “conservative revenue forecast” is “a touch disappointing,” said Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at broker XTB, in an investor note. The company’s customer base is also increasingly concentrated. Cloud service providers, which include the likes of Amazon Web Services, accounted for around half of Nvidia’s data center revenue, compared with 45 percent during the same period a year ago. Nvidia’s reliance on this sector “could be a mild cause of concern” going forward, according to Brooks. While some players in the tech industry have also raised concerns that A.I. model improvements are hitting a plateau, Huang remains optimistic about their scaling potential. “Pre-training scaling is intact and its continuing,” said the CEO, adding that test-time compute research has also emerged as an additional and promising method of scaling. “As a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great.” Nvidia expects the A.I. hype will only continue as society embraces the technology. Besides predicting that machine learning will eventually replace coding, Huang noted that data centers around the world are being modernized into “A.I. factories” that will generate A.I. “just like we’ve generated electricity.” The early foundations of an A.I.-driven world are already evident in developments like the adoption of A.I. agents across workplaces and breakthroughs across physical A.I., said Huang. “We expect this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several more years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

November 21, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Ubitium Ubitium Düsseldorf, Nov. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For over half a century, general-purpose processors have been built on the Tomasulo algorithm, developed by IBM engineer Robert Tomasulo in 1967. It’s a $500B industry built on specialised CPU, GPU and other chips for different computing tasks. Hardware startup Ubitium has shattered this paradigm with a breakthrough universal processor that handles all computing workloads on a single, efficient chip - unlocking simpler, smarter, and more cost-effective devices across industries - while revolutionizing a 57-year-old industry standard. Alongside this, Ubitium is announcing a $3.7 million in seed funding round, co-led by Runa Capital, Inflection, and KBC Focus Fund. The investment will be used to develop the first prototypes and prepare initial development kits for customers, with the first chips planned for 2026. Ubitium founders Martin Vorbach and Hyun Shin Sho Ubitium was founded by semiconductor veterans dedicated to revolutionizing processor architecture. CTO Martin Vorbach, who holds over 200 semiconductor patents licensed by major U.S. chip companies, spent 15 years developing this groundbreaking technology. Drawing from his pioneering work in reconfigurable computing, he created a workload-agnostic microarchitecture that allows the same transistors to be reused for different processing tasks—eliminating the need for multiple specialized cores and enabling AI at no additional cost. Working between Germany and Cupertino, California, Vorbach's innovation forms the foundation of Ubitium's mission. Vorbach met CEO Hyun Shin Cho at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). After two decades of gaining insights across various industrial sectors, Cho reunited with Vorbach to commercialize the technology. Completing the team is Chairman Peter Weber, a veteran of Intel, Texas Instruments, and Dialog Semiconductor, who brings extensive industry expertise. "The $500 billion processor industry is built on restrictive boundaries between computing tasks," says Hyun Shin Cho, CEO of Ubitium. "We're erasing those boundaries. Our Universal Processor does it all - CPU, GPU, DSP, FPGA - in one chip, one architecture. This isn't an incremental improvement. It is a paradigm shift. This is the processor architecture the AI era demands." “For too long, we’ve accepted that making devices intelligent means making them complex. Multiple processors or processor cores, multiple development teams, endless integration challenges—today, that changes. Our Universal Processor delivers workload-agnostic and AI-enabling compute capabilities to edge devices with a single chip, at a fraction of the cost to develop and manufacture compared to today’s offerings.” With the semiconductor market projected to exceed $700 billion by 2025, Ubitium's technology initially targets embedded systems and robotics. By simplifying system architectures and reducing costs, Ubitium's processor makes advanced computing capabilities accessible across all industries without requiring specialized hardware for each application—enabling advanced AI at no additional cost. Dmitry Galperin, a Berlin-based General Partner at Runa Capital, commented: "We're impressed by Ubitium's unique approach to processor microarchitecture, which is now able to adapt to any type of workload—from simple control logic to massive parallel data flow processing." "What Ubitium brings will provide a real breakthrough to develop and launch any new product with embedded electronics. Their approach will reduce the cost as well as the complexity, allowing a much faster time-to-market. What previously required multiple teams to collaborate on hardware and software design now becomes purely a software project," said Rudi Severijns, Investment Director at KBC Focus Fund. "Ubitium was a perfect fit as a contrarian bet on a stellar team working on generalized compute capacity in a world of chip specialization," said Jonatan Luther-Bergquist, Partner at Inflection. “We are excited to see Ubitium leveraging the flexibility and scalability of the RISC-V architecture,” said Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International. “Their innovative approach to universal processor design exemplifies the freedom of innovation made possible by the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture and highlights the potential for RISC-V to drive advancements in edge computing and AI applications.” Looking ahead, Ubitium plans to develop a complete portfolio of chips that vary in array size but share the same microarchitecture and software stack—enabling solutions from small embedded devices to high-performance computing systems. This super-scalable approach allows customers to scale their applications without changing their development process, while the workload-agnostic design ensures the processor can adapt to handle any computing task without specialized hardware modifications. The company's goal is to establish its universal processor as the new standard that finally breaks down the cost and complexity barriers that have limited the deployment of advanced computing and AI capabilities across industries. "We envision a future where every device operates autonomously, making intelligent decisions in real time and transforming the way we interact with technology," added Hyun Shin Cho.

Title: Exclusive: Arcade, visual storytelling platform, raises $14 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins

Caroline Clark’s first word was “up.” Every child’s first word is seismic, and it was especially so for Clark: At the age of two, she was diagnosed as deaf. In a taped 2019 talk from her time in business school at Stanford, Clark tells the story of how her mother taught her to speak, starting word by word. And because no one’s more equipped to improve communication than someone who has truly spent time thinking about it deeply, Clark is now the cofounder and CEO of Arcade, a visual storytelling platform. “That experience learning how to speak from my mother has taught me how precious it is to choose every word,” she said. “I’ve used words to tell myself what’s possible. They’re powerful. In many ways, I think Arcade is helping you achieve that power—not only coming up with the right words but showing them in the most creative way possible.” It’s fitting that, in some sense, Clark’s job is helping companies find their voices, visuals, and stories. Arcade’s customers currently include Salesforce, Zapier, Atlassian, New Relic, Superhuman, and Carta, all of whom use the platform to develop interactive demos. “I think that people underestimate Arcade,” Clark told Fortune. “They say ‘Oh, it’s just a demo tool,’ but I think the word ‘demo’ is limiting. It’s really about content, collaboration, and creativity.” The company probably won’t be underestimated much longer, with more than 14,000 companies using the platform—and a new milestone. Arcade has raised a $14 million Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins, Fortune can exclusively report. Upfront Ventures and Foundation Capital, both existing investors, also participated in the round. Founded in 2021, Arcade draws inspiration from video games in both its name and product, which includes features like pulsating dots and load times. That’s not an accident—Clark and I talked about comic books (she recently read video game designer Jordan Mechner’s graphic memoir Replay) and her belief in “playfulness and going through the product as adventure.” Aditi Maliwal, Upfront Ventures partner, wrote the first check into Arcade in March 2021, and she’s watched Clark grow the company from a product into an enterprise sales company. “It’s really hard to cross that chasm and it takes a long time, but she’s a force of nature,” said Maliwal, who’s known Clark for seven years. “I wear this bracelet every day that says ‘resilience’ and, to me, Caroline signifies resilience. She truly had to learn how to hear and how to speak. She’s learned how to hear through her eyes.” Arcade’s opportunity fundamentally ties back to “the sea of software everywhere we go,” said Kleiner Perkins partner Mamoon Hamid. Clark had for years specifically wanted to work with Hamid, drawn to his track record investing in gorgeous workplace efficiency juggernauts like Slack, Figma, and Box. Hamid, who will join Arcade’s board, draws a parallel between Arcade and the evolution of tools like Slack, which brought a new level of visual and interactive communication to workplaces. “What I love about Arcade is that it’s creating this market where, if you describe the category, it doesn’t sound all that interesting,” he told Fortune. “Enterprise chat doesn’t sound interesting, but when you overlay a great product you can use, it drives some enjoyment—like communicating via Slack ten years ago with colleagues when the alternative was chat inside of Gmail or text messaging. There’s a richness these tools offer… and in the same vein, Arcade is very powerful yet beautiful in the way it helps you tell stories.” And, yeah, there’s an AI angle here—Arcade is currently investing in AI features like synthetic voice, automated translations, and recommendations that enhance the content creation process. But it’s all in the service of something that Clark speaks about more clearly than just about any professional storyteller I know: Precise communication not only matters but also makes a difference in real-world outcomes. “This is a really big statement, but broadly there’s so much happiness in words, but also pain that comes from miscommunication when you hear the wrong set of words,” said Clark. “You hear the right set of words, and you’re inspired and motivated. It really matters because there’s just so much more joy that could come from being measured and thoughtful about words.” To tell a story, you need to learn to hear, listen, and then talk. In its way, Arcade is about learning to speak—and it’s ready to be heard.

Inflation Data Unwinds Some of the Post-Election Rally Stocks soared on 11/6/24 on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration would issue business-friendly policies including relaxed regulations and additional tax cuts. The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date. The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration. October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings. Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices. For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%). There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations. PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point. The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase. Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months. The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18. According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather. In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Re GOOG GOOGL BABA SPG TRI

On 19 November 2024, Nasdaq began listing options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (ticker: IBIT). According to a report by Bloomberg, this launch follows over 10 months of collaboration between Nasdaq, BlackRock, and regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation. Alison Hennessy, Nasdaq’s Head of ETP Listings, confirmed the launch, highlighting strong demand from investors seeking greater flexibility in managing Bitcoin exposure. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed over $30 billion in assets since its debut, making it the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the market. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that while spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have succeeded on their own merits, the addition of options provides a significant tailwind. Options offer investors a way to express precise views on Bitcoin’s price movement, ultimately driving greater volumes and assets into the product. In a recent blog post, Singapore-based crypto-focused proprietary trading firm and market maker QCP Capital emphasized the broader significance of this launch in their blog post, pointing out how institutional investors could benefit from regulated derivatives tied to IBIT. They noted that spot Bitcoin ETF options could attract a wave of institutions that face barriers to native crypto options platforms like Deribit. QCP Capital said that derivatives in traditional markets often grow to 10-20 times the size of the underlying asset’s market capitalization, and a similar trend could unfold in Bitcoin. Institutions may use these options to generate yield on long-term holdings, potentially compressing implied volatility in Bitcoin markets. Drawing parallels to the growing use of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy, QCP Capital cited Q3 2024 filings showing a surge in institutional holders of MicroStrategy from 667 to 738. Vanguard alone increased its holdings by nearly 16 million shares—a 1,000% jump. QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin was stabilizing above $90,000, with the December 100k strike holding the highest open interest among IBIT options. Narrowing implied volatility spreads reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory, potentially setting the stage for upward momentum. The firm also pointed to broader trends in institutional adoption, such as Goldman Sachs’ plans to spin off its digital asset platform, as further evidence of the integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) stands against other best climate change stocks. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the state of the climate in 2023 was marked by record-breaking levels of greenhouse gas emissions, ocean heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The observed concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record levels in 2022 and continued to increase in 2023. CO2 levels are now 50% higher than in the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term increase in global temperature. The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45°C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average, making it the warmest year on record. Sea level rise also continued to accelerate, with global mean sea level reaching a record high in the satellite record (since 1993). This reflects continued ocean warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002). Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents, including major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat, and drought. The number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled, from 149 million people before the COVID-19 pandemic to 333 million people in 2023. Weather and climate hazards continued to trigger displacement, with 1.8 million people displaced across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

According to a report published by Bloomberg on October 21, hedge funds are increasingly betting against the green economy despite significant global investments in clean energy and green technologies. Analysis of data from Hazeltree, which tracks disclosures from roughly 500 hedge funds, reveals that more funds are net short on green sectors such as solar, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and hydrogen than are net long. Conversely, fossil fuel sectors such as oil, gas, and coal have attracted more long bets. This shift reflects skepticism about the profitability and short-term viability of green investments, even as governments and scientists emphasize their necessity for addressing climate change. Higher interest rates have made capital-intensive projects such as offshore wind farms less viable, while geopolitical tensions, particularly around China's dominance in green technology supply chains, have deterred investments in areas like solar energy and EVs. Solar energy has seen a sharp decline, with hedge funds shorting 77% of companies in the Invesco Solar ETF as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33% in early 2021, when momentum for the green transition hit a peak. However, US-based companies that avoid reliance on China-dominated technologies, are exceptions. Similarly, the EV and battery sectors have seen a slowdown, with net short positions exceeding longs on 55% of companies in relevant ETFs. Fossil fuels, by contrast, have gained favor. Hedge funds are long on 53% of companies in the S&P Global Oil Index and 73% of major thermal coal companies. Rising global energy consumption and geopolitical instability have bolstered the case for these investments, even as green energy struggles to meet demand reliably. Hedge fund managers argue that fossil fuels remain essential for stable energy supplies. Hedge funds have shown optimism about wind energy, with long bets on nearly 60% of companies in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF, supported by growing government orders. Power infrastructure, including transmission grids, has also attracted interest, with long bets outnumbering shorts on 65% of companies in the sector. This sub-sector is considered crucial for meeting increasing electricity demands, including those driven by AI data centers. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely watching the impact of the new administration on the renewable energy sector. With the global demand for clean energy on the rise and innovation in renewable technologies driving growth, the sector's long-term outlook remains compelling.

Title: Bitcoin Soars To New Highs Near $95,000: Analyst Reveals Bullish Price Targets Ahead

Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new record high of $94,730, continuing a significant uptrend that began on November 5. Analysts are dubbing this rally the “Trump trade,” as the recent political developments surrounding Donald Trump’s victory have instilled renewed confidence among investors in BTC and the broader crypto market. Despite the impressive surge, analysts believe Bitcoin’s price discovery is far from complete, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Among those sharing this bullish sentiment is analyst Ali Martinez, who draws parallels between Bitcoin’s current price movements and those seen in December 2020, before the notable uptrend that ultimately led to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Martinez notes that the relative strength index (RSI), a key technical indicator used to gauge momentum, is currently mirroring the patterns observed in late 2020. This similarity suggests that the BTC price may be poised for significant upward movements in the coming months. According to Martinez, if this trend continues, Bitcoin could target the $108,000 mark, followed by a potential correction to around $99,000, before bouncing back to a predicted milestone of $135,000. This forecast represents an increase of over 42% from current levels, although Martinez did not specify a timeline for these movements, indicating they might occur anywhere between now and the first quarter of 2025. In even more optimistic projections, market expert Timothy Peterson, who identifies as a network economist, suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish trend could persist until November 2025, with ambitious targets set for the future. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peterson predicted that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 per coin by Thanksgiving Day 2025. He bases this projection on Metcalfe’s Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of users. This indicates that as more individuals adopt Bitcoin, its value is likely to increase significantly. Looking further ahead, the economist also asserts that the Bitcoin price could achieve the coveted valuation of $1,000,000 per coin by 2029, representing a staggering 954% increase from current levels. Trading at $94,730 as of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has seen massive gains in recent weeks, with a 26% and 39% increase in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively. Furthermore, BTC has reached a market cap valuation of $1.8 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world, currently ranked 7th, just behind companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But quite far from the leading asset in this matter which is gold with a market cap of $17 trillion.

Title: Nvidia reports solid Q3, stock down as guidance underwhelms lofty expectations
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-q3-results-beat-but-guidance-underwhelms-lofty-expectations-3733402
Time Published: 2024-11-21T08:40:49Z
Full Content:
Investing.com - Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, but its current-quarter guidance underwhelmed lofty investor expectations amid red-hot AI demand. The company forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares initially fell roughly 3% in premarket trading Thursday, but rebounded 0.9% into positive territory after the market opened. The company announced Q3 earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.75 on revenue of $33.09B Data center revenue was $30.8B, up 17% from Q2 and up 112% from a year ago. That compared with estimates for $28.84B. Looking ahead to Q4, revenue is expected to be $37.5B, plus or minus 2%, compared with estimates of $37.09B. GAAP gross margins were expected to be 73.0%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Commenting on the print, Bank of America analysts said they "expect [the] stock to churn near-term as investors digest lack of “sizzle” but we continue to like the stock on its “substance”. They note that Nvidia remains the fastest-growing mega-cap company and the undisputed leader in converting $1 trillion of legacy infrastructure to accelerated systems, and continues to generate solid free cash flow (FCF). Separately, Piper Sandler analysts said Nvidia's report, despite missing elevated guidance expectations, sets up the chipmaker "for extremely strong growth starting in April." "The key here is that NVDA is going through a product transition with Blackwell ramping and H200 remaining strong," analysts led by Harsh V. Kumar wrote. "We also continue to believe that starting April, the beat cadence will be quite a bit higher than the $2B cadence NVDA has more or less maintained thus far," they added. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, which some believe represent the next frontier for the company, are expected to face supply constraints amid red-hot demand. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," Nvidia said on Wednesday. Yasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig in the middle of the ocean, its towering structure standing stout in the horizon. Average Upside Potential: 15.67% Share Price: $17.29 Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. The firm is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations encompassing transportation, storage, and terminalling for natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, refined products, and liquid natural gas. 80 countries and territories receive the firm’s exports. Energy Transfer was formed in 1996. Energy Transfer has one of America’s largest energy portfolios, with nearly 130,000 miles of pipelines and associated energy infrastructure in 44 states transporting the oil and gas products that make lives possible. The firm has been supplying America energy for more than two decades, representing a journey from a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator to one of the largest investment-grade master limited partnerships in the US. The firm has a leading natural gas pipeline footprint well positioned to cater to the growing electricity demand as it pursues opportunities to serve growing power loads from new demand centers across its pipeline network. Additionally, the well-balanced asset mix tends to offer strong earnings support. In this regard, the firm’s segments include Crude Oil, NGL & Refined Products, Midstream (Gathering & Processing), Natural Gas Interstate Transport & Storage, and Natural Gas Intrastate Transport & Storage. For Q3 2024, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) reported a net income of $1.18 billion, up 103% compared to Q3 2024. Volumes on the firm’s assets continued to increase in the quarter with the addition of new organic growth projects and acquisitions. Crude oil transportation volumes were up 25%, NGL fractionation volumes were up 12%, NGL transportation volumes were up 4%, and Midstream gathered volumes and produced volumes were up 6% and 26%, respectively. With a unique nationwide footprint, a portfolio of assets with exceptional product and geographic diversity, and export capabilities, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) ranks as one of the best stocks currently trading below $25. Overall, ET ranks 12th on our list of best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ET as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:ITUB) is a full-service, universal bank with a presence in 18 countries. It is present in 18 countries with its main businesses including Corporate & Investment Banking, Asset Management, Private Banking, and Retail Business. The firm adopts the “Phygital” model (a combination of physical and digital) to provide its clients with the freedom to choose how they want to relate to the bank. The company is one of the largest Brazilian private banks in market value. Based on market value on October 31, the company serves as the largest bank in Latin America with 100 years of history. The firm’s ability to adapt, innovate, and change has enabled it to achieve the status of a universal bank. Apart from offering the most complete portfolio of financial products and services, the firm serves clients how, when, and where they want to be served being a digital bank with the advantage of in-person service. The firm’s recurring managerial result reached R$10.7 billion in Q3 2024, up 19.4% year-over-year. At the same time, the credit portfolio grew 9.9% year-over-year. Revenues from investment banking operations and brokerage services declined as a result of lower activity in the fixed-income market but were offset by improved revenues from credit card activities, asset management, and higher results from insurance operations. Thus, Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (NYSE:ITUB) is a leading universal bank with a rich history, a broad product portfolio, and a dominant position in Latin America.

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $35.1 billion for Q3, up 17% sequentially and 94% year-on-year, surpassing their outlook of $32.5 billion. Data center revenue reached a record $30.8 billion, with a 17% sequential increase and 112% year-on-year growth, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper and H200 products. NVIDIA's AI enterprise revenue is expected to more than double from last year, with a growing pipeline and annualizing software service and support revenue at $1.5 billion, projected to exceed $2 billion by year-end. The company is experiencing significant demand for its new Blackwell GPUs, with plans to exceed previous revenue estimates and ramp up supply to meet customer needs. NVIDIA's gaming revenue increased by 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year, supported by strong back-to-school sales and healthy channel inventory. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces supply constraints in gaming, which are expected to impact Q4 revenue despite strong sell-through in Q3. Gross margins are expected to moderate to the low 70s as Blackwell ramps up, with initial configurations potentially impacting profitability. Networking revenue was sequentially down, despite strong year-on-year growth, indicating potential challenges in meeting demand for networking components. The company anticipates competitive market conditions in China due to export controls, which could affect future data center revenue from the region. There are concerns about potential digestion phases in hardware deployment cycles, which could impact growth as the market adjusts to new technologies. Q: Can you discuss the debate around whether scaling for large language models has stalled and how NVIDIA is addressing this? A: Jensen Huang, President and CEO, explained that foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and continuing. NVIDIA is helping customers with post-training scaling and inference time scaling, which are driving demand for their infrastructures. The next generation of models starts with 100,000 Blackwells, indicating strong industry movement. Q: There were reports about heating issues with Blackwell. Can you address concerns about your ability to execute the roadmap with Ultra and Rubin? A: Jensen Huang assured that Blackwell production is in full steam, with more units being delivered than previously estimated. The supply chain is robust, and NVIDIA is on track with its annual roadmap, focusing on performance improvements and reducing AI costs. Q: How is Blackwell expected to ramp this year, and how will it affect gross margins? A: Colette Kress, CFO, stated that Blackwell will ramp with initial gross margins in the low 70s, improving to mid-70s as production scales. Jensen Huang added that Blackwell shipments will increase each quarter, with significant demand driven by shifts in computing from CPUs to GPUs. Q: Could NVIDIA recover to mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? A: Colette Kress confirmed that reaching mid-70s gross margin in the second half of next year is a reasonable assumption, depending on the mix of ramp. Q: Can you provide an update on Sovereign AI demand and explain the supply constraints in gaming? A: Colette Kress noted that Sovereign AI demand remains strong, with growth opportunities in regional clouds and AI factories. Gaming supply constraints are due to fast sell-through and efforts to ramp up supply, expected to improve in the new calendar year.

Full Content:
In a recent interview with FOX Business, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, shared insights on the so-called “Trump trade” impacting crypto prices, as evidenced by Bitcoin’s recent streak of consecutive all-time highs over the past 48 hours. Garlinghouse also discussed how Ripple, and the broader digital asset industry, fit into the upcoming regulatory landscape expected under President-elect Donald Trump in the coming year. Garlinghouse emphasized that since its inception, Ripple has focused on addressing the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, which he described as “slow and expensive.” By utilizing XRP, the company aims to streamline these transactions, making them faster and more cost-effective. However, the CEO criticized the Biden administration’s stance on digital assets, referring to it as an “unlawful war” against the industry. He expressed optimism that with Trump’s pro-crypto approach, the landscape may be transforming. When asked about the potential for increased revenue opportunities in the US under the upcoming regulatory changes, Garlinghouse explained that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against XRP had effectively “frozen” Ripple’s market potential in the country. Currently, 95% of Ripple’s customer base is located outside the US, with Garlinghouse pointing out that the company cannot fully realize growth in a market where regulatory clarity is lacking. Garlinghouse observed that while the cryptocurrency industry is flourishing in countries like China, Japan, the UK, and Switzerland, the US has lagged behind in embracing digital assets. Ripple’s CEO expressed hope that the anticipated deregulation under Trump would lead to clearer guidelines, allowing agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to play a constructive role in shaping the industry. Garlinghosue criticized the existing regulatory framework, particularly the application of the Howey Test, which he believes fails to adequately address the unique characteristics of the crypto sector. He also underscored the need for updated regulations that reflect the realities of an industry that has developed significantly over the past decade. During the interview, FOX Business highlighted comments from Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, regarding the private meeting between Trump and Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. Shirzad noted that Trump has expressed a willingness to engage with the crypto industry, fostering a vision for the US to become the global leader in digital assets. Garlinghouse echoed these sentiments, recognizing Coinbase’s influential role in advocating for the cryptocurrency agenda during the election campaign. As speculation mounts regarding potential candidates for the SEC chair position under Trump—names like Dan Gallagher, Teresa Goody, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda have surfaced—Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of the new chair working collaboratively with Congress to address regulatory gaps that contribute to confusion in the market. Garlinghouse concluded with an optimistic outlook, stating that he believes a new era for cryptocurrency is on the horizon in the US. He envisions the country becoming a central hub for digital assets and blockchain technology over the next five to ten years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.10, marking a massive 104% surge in just two weeks since Trump’s election victory. However, the token is still trading 67% below its all-time high of $3,040, which it reached nearly seven years ago.

The bitcoin price has climbed steadily this year, pushed on by a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hitting Wall Street, interest from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts—with a top Fed official recently revealing a surprise bitcoin flip. Now, as traders bet on a Trump bitcoin "game-changer," a leak has revealed Trump could appoint the first ever White House "crypto czar." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has helped the bitcoin price boom this year. Trump's top team is meeting with bitcoin and crypto experts and industry executives to discuss creating a White House role dedicated to cryptocurrency policy, overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. The appointment of a White House crypto czar would likely boost already sky-high expectations that Trump could create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve that would see him follow through on promises made during a July bitcoin conference to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet." Speculators on the crypto-powered Polymarket prediction platform now see a more than 40% chance that Trump will create a bitcoin strategic reserve, with the odds climbing sharply following the leak of Trump's crypto czar discussions. Earlier this year, U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) introduced The Bitcoin Act to Congress, calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.'s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt by buying 1 million bitcoin over five years. Trump has surrounded himself with heavily pro-bitcoin and crypto advisors through 2024, with some of his high-profile cabinet appointments known to be supporters of bitcoin and crypto. This week, Trump named Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick, who claims to "have hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to bitcoin," to be his Commerce secretary. "Bitcoin, which is rare and is special, will become ever more rare, ever more valuable, over time it'll be financed just like gold [and] oil. Bitcoin will be way, way, way higher—sometimes lower—you just have to have faith," Lutnick, who is the U.S. custodian for Tether's $130 billion stablecoin USDT via Cantor Fitzgerald, said earlier this month. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin, smashing its previous all-time high and ... [+] making bitcoin a $2 trillion asset. Meanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the earliest candidates in this year's election to accept bitcoin for campaign donations, has been nominated by Trump to be the next U.S. Health secretary. "Bitcoin is the currency of freedom, a hedge against inflation for middle class Americans, a remedy against the dollar’s downgrade from the world’s reserve currency, and the offramp from a ruinous national debt," RFK Jr. recently posted to X. Elsewhere, David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc and advisor to Trump on bitcoin strategy, has said he believes Trump could appoint senator Bill Hagerty, a bitcoin and crypto advocate, as his Treasury secretary. "If it happens, back up the truck and dump everything you own into bitcoin," Bailey posted to X. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Forêt restaurant review: A masterclass in French classic cooking in Dublin 4
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/review/2024/11/21/foret-restaurant-review-a-masterclass-in-french-classic-cooking-in-dublin-4/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
I’ve been banging on about the lack of proper French restaurants in Dublin for years. Loudly. And, until recently, to absolutely no avail. If dining trends are cyclical, the 2015 closure of Racine in London – where I once dined on Henry Harris’s famed tête de veau with sauce ravigote, minus the calf’s brain (something to do with supply, I was told, though it didn’t stop the obvious jokes) – marked the end of bourgeois cooking and the dominance of new Nordic cuisine and its small plates. Now, London has gone full bouchon (Lyonnaise style restaurant). Harris is back, rattling pans at Bouchon Racine (good luck getting a booking), and bouchon-inspired spots are springing up faster than champignons after a downpour: Josephine Bouchon, Henri, Café Francois, Marceline – proof, if it were needed, that the Gallic revival is in full swing. And Dublin? Rien du tout. Until now. John and Sandy Wyer got wind that the space above O’Brien’s pub, conveniently next door to their fine dining spot, Forest Avenue, on Sussex Terrace, had become available. Formerly The Sussex, the room came pre-loaded with bistro charm: Victorian flourishes, casual wooden tables, and banquettes you can sink into. A few tweaks later, et voilà – a proper bistro, at last. They’ve named it Forêt, staying true to their woodland theme (see also: Little Forest in Blackrock). The menu is a celebration of French cooking at its most confident. Petites Assiettes (snacks) include house-made saucisson, leek vinaigrette, Bayonne ham and oysters mignonette (€3 each), a bright and briny opener. From the tempting Les Entrées, comes the terrine de campagne (€16). This rustic staple, straight from the bouchon playbook, is robust, slightly coarse, and made with Oxford Sandy and Black suckling pig from Dermot Allen’s Winetavern Farm in Wicklow. It’s crowned with an amber gelée, lightly laced with sherry (if I’m not mistaken), delivering a rich, savoury depth when spread onto the toasted sourdough. The violet mustard on the side is sharp enough to jolt you awake, while the cornichons add just the right tangy crunch to balance the richness. For our other starter, a salad of green beans (€12) mingles with rocket, lettuce, hazelnuts and potato in a velvety dressing that pools on the plate, topped with grated mimolette, the nutty Edam-style cheese from Lille. It’s simple but beautifully executed. [ Ballyfin restaurant review: ‘Downright dazzling, one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year’Opens in new window ] The French wine list is a salute to tradition, carefully chosen without falling into populist clichés and favouring low volume producers. There are eight wines by the glass (which are also available as half bottles), and the Forest Avenue house wine, a very good Burgundian Chardonnay (€48), carries us happily through the meal. The fish, halibut Grenobloise with artichoke purée (€28), is stunning. The skin is gloriously crisp, and the pearlescent flakes of fish are so perfectly cooked they practically glow. Capers and chives bring a bright, salty punch, while pickled celery adds crunch and a vinegary bite. A creamy, lemon-spiked sauce ties everything together, while the artichoke purée sits quietly on the side, offering an earthy counterpoint to the fish, fondant potato and sauce. It’s the dish of the evening, without question. Across the table, my daughter Belle has the chicken au vin jaune (€26) which is also very tasty. The bronzed, crackling skin hides succulent free-range breast meat, while the sauce – enriched with Jura’s famed Savagnin wine, aged under flor for six years – delivers nutty, rounded depth. It’s paired with kale, finely chopped morel mushrooms, and riz à la paysanne: buttery rice laced with tarragon and dotted with tender nuggets of chicken. Desserts walk the line between indulgence and restraint. The crème brûlée is tempting, but there’s only room to share, so croissant pudding (€8) it is. Croissants from the Wyers’ Una Bakery are transformed into a luxurious bread-and-butter pudding: crispy on top, custardy in the middle, and swimming in Cointreau caramel and custard. The vanilla ice-cream, with an intriguing touch of buckwheat, is bold yet balanced. [ Parrilla restaurant review: With happy diners and cocktail shaker at full throttle, Tuesday is the new Friday at this new Mexican spotOpens in new window ] Forêt is a masterclass in why the classics endure. Why butter, cream and meticulously sourced produce remain the holy trinity of good taste – and why a perfect croissant is never just a croissant. It’s a love letter to the French bistro, where every dish is cooked with precision, seasoned with authority, and served with an unwavering respect for tradition. The attention to detail goes beyond the plate, from the well-considered wine list to the understated ambiance, making it more than just a meal. It’s an experience. And with prices so thoughtfully pitched, it’s poised to become a firm favourite. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and water was €148. The Verdict: It’s Lyonnaise bouchon in spirit and pure joy on the plate. Food provenance: Glenmar, Kingsbury Wagyu, Winetavern Farm, McNally Farm, and Castleruddery Farm. Vegetarian options: Leek vinaigrette, egg mayonnaise with celeriac rémoulade, onion velouté, green bean salad and vegetarian pithivier for main course. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: French classics, from Georges Brassen to Gillian Hills.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach $95,000 For The First Time In History

Bitcoin broke through $95,000 this evening. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin prices attained their latest all-time high this evening when they climbed to $95,000 for the first time ever. The world’s most prominent digital currency, which has been enjoying some very compelling upside in recent weeks, rose to $95,000.20, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. The cryptocurrency has notched a series of fresh records recently as it benefits from very strong momentum and a wide range of bullish factors. Several analysts commented on the digital asset’s strength as of late, as well as developments that have helped fuel its aggressive gains. “It seems that almost every day Bitcoin makes a new all time high!” the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O said via emailed comments. “There are rumors circulating that Bitcoins latest push could be due to 1) Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1 billion inflows in 48 hours with ARKS ARKB leading the way with $267.3 million in inflows and 2)BlackRock Bitcoin ETF options launching with $1.9 Billion dollars traded on it’s first day!” she stated in reference to today’s upward movement. The market observer emphasized the strong inflows enjoyed by bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the significant interest in options contracts based on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT. Interestingly enough, the total bitcoin held by U.S. bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed 1 million units, according to figures that CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno supplied via Telegram chat. The chart below illustrates this milestone: U.S. bitcoin ETFs' total bitcoin holdings recently passed 1 million units. One analyst emphasized how intense demand for bitcoin is right now as the digital currency benefits from a very compelling combination of bullish factors. “Bitcoin’s climb to $95,000 feels like humanity finally boarding a lifeboat while the legacy financial system’s Titanic takes on water,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Persistent inflation, fiat instability, and a lack of trust in central banks are driving both individuals and institutions toward Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value,” he added. “Today’s surge likely stems from a perfect storm: rising demand, a supply crunch, and unwavering conviction from long-term holders.” One market observer spoke to just how bright bitcoin’s future seems to be. George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, spoke to the digital currency’s current situation, emphasizing that “Typically you have at least some reasonable Bull and Bear case on anything.” “For example we have followed COIN through BTC to profit heavily off the ‘Trump trade’ the other stock we targeted before the election was Tesla,” he noted. “We said it would move around full self driving and sure enough it did around positive news this week. But you see things like this questioning the viability of FSD.” “There is some Bear case that is being made,” stressed Kailas. “I don't see a Bear case over the next 4 years right now for BTC so that is invariably going to create an environment where more and more major players jump on that bandwagon because it is glaring them in the face.” Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $95,000 for first time on optimism over Trump crypto plans

By Tom Westbrook, Samuel Indyk and Suzanne McGee SINGAPORE/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bitcoin came within a whisker of closing above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading between $98,000 and $99,000 in late afternoon trading in the U.S. on Thursday, after briefly touching $99,073. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Over 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. "Everyone who’s bought bitcoin at any point in history is currently in profit," Alicia Kao, managing director of crypto exchange KuCoin, said. "But those who bought it early, when there were significant obstacles to doing so and there was the might of the world’s financial and governmental forces intent on crushing it, are the real winners. Not because they’re rich, but because they’re right.” Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. CRYPTO RUSH More than $4 billion has streamed into U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election. This week, there was a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF, with call options - bets on the price going up - more popular than puts. "There is a persistent bid in the market," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a digital assets hedge fund in Miami. "$100,000 is a foregone conclusion." Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 2.3% on Thursday. “Once you break out to new highs, you attract a lot of new capital," John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, said. "It's like gold in the 1970s, where this new high is in a price discovery mode. You don't know how high it's going to go," he said. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticized for its energy usage, with miners under scrutiny over their potential impact on power grids and greenhouse gas emissions due to their energy-intensive operations. Crypto crime also remains a concern, with an analysis by crypto researchers Chainalysis finding that at least $24.2 billion worth of crypto was sent to illicit wallet addresses last year, including addresses identified as sanctioned or linked to terrorist financing and scams.

Title: Snowflake’s shares surge higher on blowout earnings, a promising acquisition and new AI partnership

UPDATED 20:17 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the cloud data warehouse company Snowflake Inc. jumped more than 30% in trading Thursday, with the bullish sentiment driven by a crushing earnings and revenue beat and increased guidance for the fiscal year. The company also announced a key partnership with the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic PBC and said it’s going to acquire the data integration startup Datavolo Inc., further boosting investor optimism. Snowflake reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 20 cents per share in the quarter, easily beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 15 cents. Revenue for the period rose 28% from a year ago, to $942 million, cruising past the Street’s target of $897 million. However, the strong numbers didn’t prevent Snowflake’s loss from widening. It reported a net loss of $324.3 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $214.3 million one year earlier. The company said product revenue accounted for 96% of its total sales. The company uses product revenue as its main guidance indicator, and it said it sees a total of $3.43 billion in fiscal 2025, which would imply growth of 29%. That’s up quite a bit from its previous product revenue forecast of $3.36 billion, issued three months ago. In addition, Snowflake said it’s now anticipating an adjusted operating margin of 5%, up from 3% earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) said the company intends to focus now on saving money with a view to increasing its profitability in the quarters ahead. “We’ve been creating centralized, more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster,” Ramaswamy said. However, the company’s chief financial officer Mike Scarpelli butted in to say that the company is not planning any layoffs in the foreseeable future, despite that reorganization. The company reported 10,618 paying customers at the end of October, up 369 from three months ago and above the Street’s target of 10,601 customers. One of those customers is the U.S. government, which generates only a very small fraction of its revenue at present. But Scarpelli told analysts that he sees significant room for growth. “We feel good about what we’re doing, and we think there’s a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years,” he said. No doubt part of that potential stems from Snowflake’s recent acquisition of a company called Night Shift Development Inc., a data analytics startup focused on the U.S. public sector. That acquisition was announced in September, when Snowflake said it will complement its ongoing investment in enabling more informed decision-making across government agencies. Snowflake’s cloud data warehouse offerings have become more relevant to enterprises thanks to the ongoing shift from traditional on-premises servers to the cloud. In recent months they have been further boosted by the growing demand for data to power artificial intelligence workloads. For years, the company has been viewed as a rival to public cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but at the same time, those companies are also key partners, providing it with its underlying infrastructure. Ramaswamy indicated that those partnerships are now taking on even more significance. “Through our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters,” he told analysts on the call. Third Bridge analyst Jordan Berger said the company’s strong revenue growth signals a return of strength and a subsidence of cost optimization headwinds that had held it back in recent quarters. “As an additional positive indication, after a period of sequential deceleration, its net revenue retention remained stable quarter-over-quarter at 127%,” the analyst said. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. praised Snowflake for its strong revenue growth, driven by enterprise’s hunger for data-driven insights, but said investors may be worried at its worsening profitability. “Snowflake’s growth is coming at an increased cost, with the company loosing $1 for every $3 it grabs in revenue,” the analyst pointed out. “On the plus side, its research and development costs have overtaken sales and marketing expenses, which suggests the company is accelerating innovation for AI-powered analytics and insights. But in the long run, investors will want to see Ramaswamy and his team find a way to put costs and revenue growth in sync, so they can work on boosting that bottom line.” The acquisition of Datavolo also looks to be an important move. Snowflake didn’t reveal how much it paid to acquire the startup, which had raised $25 million in funding and sells tools for building multimodal data pipelines for AI models. Ramaswamy said the acquisition will enable Snowflake to create more versatile data pipelines for its own customers. For instance, using Datavolo’s tools, a customer might be able to replace single-use data connectors with more flexible pipelines that facilitate the movement of information from the cloud, to on-premises servers, and then to Snowflake’s data warehouse. “By bringing Datavolo into the Snowflake fold, we are expanding how much of the data lifecycle Snowflake captures — unlocking both simplicity and cost savings for our customers, without any sacrifice to data extensibility,” Ramaswamy explained. As for the multiyear partnership with Anthropic, which is a rival to OpenAI, this is all about strengthening Snowflake’s hand in generative AI. The alliance means Anthropic’s most powerful Claude 3.5 models will be made accessible via Snowflake Cortex AI, which is a fully managed service for AI development that runs on AWS. Also, Snowflake’s AI agents, such as Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Analyst, will be able to leverage Claude. According to Snowflake’s executive vice president of product, Christian Kleinerman, Anthropic’s Claude models will help improve the ability of Snowflake’s AI agents to analyze data, run ad-hoc data analytics, create visualizations based on that information, and perform other multistep tasks. In addition, another benefit of the partnership is that Claude users will be able to leverage Snowflake’s Horizon Catalog service, which provides enterprise-grade compliance, security and privacy for Cortex AI. In other words, it means Claude can be secured with granular access controls and safety guardrails, ensuring more secure and trustworthy AI, Snowflake said. “Our partnership with Anthropic represents a massive leap forward in expanding on our promise to provide thousands of global customers with easy, efficient and trusted AI for a holistic set of enterprise use cases,” Kleinerman insisted. Despite the impressive after-hours gains, Snowflake’s stock is still down 35% in the year to date, compared with a gain of 24% in the broader S&P 500 index.

Title: Bitcoin Gains VanEck’s Official Support As Strategic Reserve

The firstborn cryptocurrency has found another ally in the traditional financial sector after a respected global investment company affirmed its support for making Bitcoin a strategic reserve. The backing of VanEck, a respected name in the investment sector, in Bitcoin shows the coin’s growing appeal even to traditional financial players, a remarkable milestone that could benefit the whole crypto space. Well-known asset manager VanEck announced that it is throwing its support to Bitcoin, saying that it will advocate for the plan of US President-elect Donald Trump to turn the crypto into a national strategic reserve. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, made the official announcement of the investment firm’s stance on the idea, committing himself to champion Trump’s proposal. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: VanEck Endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. No need for ‘sources’—we’ll just tell you ourselves. https://t.co/ZO28dqiBqC — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 19, 2024 VanEck will join fellow international asset manager BlackRock in the growing supporters of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, another positive development on the intensifying discussion of the role of digital assets in American economic policy. It can be recalled that in 2017, the global asset management company was the pioneer in pushing for a future-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country. As of writing, VanEck holds over 13,000 BTC with an estimated value of over $1.2 billion. In a campaign last July, Trump unveiled his vision of making the US the most successful nation in the cryptocurrency sector, announcing his plan to establish a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile” in the country. Trump said that he plans to make it a policy to keep all of the Bitcoin the US government “currently holds or acquires into the future”, adding that this BTC stockpile will become the core of the strategic national crypto reserve. During his campaign, Trump promised cryptocurrency players and investors that he would champion the sector and advocate for its deregulation. The entire crypto space is now counting on the incoming President to deliver on this commitment during his administration. Earlier this week, Satoshi Action Fund (SAF) co-founder and CEO Dennis Porter confirmed that premier asset manager BlackRock will back the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Porter believes that Trump’s government would push for the crafting of an executive order that would establish the BTC reserve, providing an optimistic outlook on the future of the alpha crypto. He added that the first step to making this reserve a reality is appointing a “pro-Bitcoin Treasury Secretary” who can initiate the creation of the strategic reserve. Moreover, Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced proposed legislation that would be key to the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Lummis urged the US Congress to pass the Boost Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. If Lummis’ bill is enacted, all the Bitcoin owned by the American government is to be preserved and not sold. Current estimates showed that the US government holds 69,370 BTC with a value of $6.4 billion. Featured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Nvidia Says Its Blackwell Chip Is Fine, Nothing to See Here
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-earnings-blackwell-chips-overheating/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T00:15:14Z
Full Content:
Chip giant Nvidia reported its third-quarter earnings earlier today, and all ears—and presumably some watch parties—were tuned in to try to determine what the company’s performance might mean for the near future of the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. The fate of the company’s newest AI chip, Blackwell, was a major focus after production issues caused shipments to be delayed for several months earlier this year. On Sunday, The Information also reported that Blackwell chips were overheating when connected together in Nvidia’s customized server racks, prompting the company to make design changes. But Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts and investors on its earnings call today that Blackwell production now “is in full steam.” “We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated,” Huang said. Some of Nvidia’s most important customers, like Microsoft and OpenAI, have already received the new chips, and Blackwell sales could end up generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company next quarter, executives said. Some industry analysts reported earlier that problems with the new chips had been fixed. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at the research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business insider that the Blackwell overheating issues “have been present for months and have largely been addressed.” Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy, told WIRED that his manufacturing contacts were unaware of any major overheating issues. But it's not unusual, he said, for there to be tension between design, engineering, and production when bringing a new chip design to market. “It’s a debate as old as semiconductors: Is it a design issue? Is it a production issue?” Moorhead said. “People are going to look for any type of smoke that can get in the way of the thesis of [Nvidia’s] dramatic growth.” Nvidia generated $35.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating estimates of $33.2 billion. Its revenue rose 94 percent compared to last year. That’s a relatively small increase compared to a few of its recent quarters, when revenue rose as much as 265 percent on an annual basis—but Nvidia isn’t going out of business anytime soon. The results indicate that the AI market is continuing to boom as companies pour billions of dollars into buying advanced chips and other equipment, albeit at a slightly slower pace. A large portion of Nvidia’s growth this quarter was driven by data center revenue, totaling $30.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 112 percent from last year. The company’s gross profit margin was 74.5 percent, essentially flat from a year ago. But analysts expect that Nvidia’s margins could shrink as the company shifts to producing more Blackwell chips, which cost more to make than their less advanced predecessors. Nvidia’s earnings reports are seen as an important bellwether for the AI industry. The chip architect’s advanced GPUs, which power complex neural network processing, are what made the current generative AI boom possible. As Silicon Valley giants raced to build new chatbots and image-generation tools over the past few years, Nvidia’s revenue exploded, allowing it to surpass Apple as the most valuable public company in the world. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, Nvidia’s stock price has increased nearly tenfold. Almost every major tech company working on AI, even those building their own processing units, rely heavily on Nvidia GPUs to train their AI models. Meta, for example, has said that it is building its latest AI technology on a cluster of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100s. Smaller AI startups, meanwhile, have been left without enough AI compute power as Nvidia struggled to keep up with demand. Blackwell, Nvidia’s newest GPU, is made up of two pieces of silicon each equivalent to the size of its previous chip, Hopper, which are combined together into a single component. This design has resulted in a chip that’s supposedly four times faster and with more than double the number of transistors as its predecessor. But the launch of Blackwell hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Originally slated to ship in the second quarter, the new chip hit a production snag, reportedly delaying the rollout by a few months. Huang took responsibility for the problem, calling it a “design flaw” that “caused the yield to be low.” Huang told Reuters in August that Nvidia’s longtime chipmaking partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, helped Nvidia correct the issue. Moorhead told WIRED he remains bullish on Nvidia and is confident that the generative AI market will continue to grow for at least the next 12 to 18 months, despite some recent reports suggesting AI progress is starting to plateau. “I think the only way shareholders would have a mutiny is if they were concerned about the capital expenditures or the profitability of the hyperscalers,” Moorhead said, referring to big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta that are heavily invested in AI cloud services. “But I think they’re just going to keep buying up Nvidia until that day actually comes.” Enterprise AI is still an area of growth for Nvidia as well, he added. On today’s earnings call, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said Nvidia’s enterprise AI tools are in “full throttle,” including an operating platform that lets other businesses build their own copilots and AI agents. Customers include Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow, she said. Huang echoed the same thing later in the call: “We’re starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI,” he said. “It’s really the latest rage.”

Despite the strong performance, shares dipped more than 2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor caution over valuation and tempered guidance. The chipmaker posted revenue of $35.08 billion for the quarter ended October 27, a 94% increase year-on-year and beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $33.28 billion. Nvidia’s non-GAAP earnings-per-share came in at $0.81, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.75 EPS. Revenue from the Data Center segment, Nvidia’s key growth driver, reached a record $30.8 billion, up 112% from the same period last year. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, called the quarter a reflection of “AI in full steam” as enterprises adopt Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs and anticipate the launch of its next-generation Blackwell platform. The tech giant has been riding high this year following an explosion of investor interest in AI-related firms and businesses. That has helped drive the Nasdaq to record heights amid prospects of a return to cheaper borrowing should the U.S. Federal Reserve continue to slash its benchmark rate. Despite strong results, Nvidia’s stock fell 0.76% during regular trading and dropped another 2.39% in after-hours, closing at $142.40. Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking after Nvidia's year-long rally, along with cautious reactions to the company’s Q4 guidance. Nvidia expects revenue of $37.5 billion for the next quarter, representing a 7% sequential increase and aligning with analyst forecasts. Nvidia’s gaming segment also saw steady growth, reporting $3.3 billion in revenue, up 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. However, smaller segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization, while growing, contributed modestly to overall revenue. While results underscore Nvidia's dominance in the AI and accelerated computing space, concerns over the company’s soaring valuation and supply constraints for its GPUs could weigh on the stock in the short term. Nvidia will hold a conference call with analysts later Wednesday to provide further insights into its outlook.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.26%) fiscal third quarter revenues beat Wall Street’s expectations for another straight quarter at a record $35.1 billion — up 94% from a year ago. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October are up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. Nvidia reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” Nvidia was expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.31%). Net income was expected to be $17.4 billion and EPS was expected at $0.75. Shares of the chipmaker were down 0.76% at the market close on Wednesday. Nvidia’s shares are up 202.86% so far this year. The company’s data center quarterly revenue was $30.8 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter, and up 112% year over year. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company was expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet estimates. “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia would have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz ahead of earnings. On an earnings call with analysts, the company said that it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell samples in the fiscal third quarter, and that the artificial intelligence platform is in full production. In response to an analyst’s questions about reports of Blackwell overheating and Nvidia’s roadmap to produce AI chips on a one year cycle, Huang said that the company plans to deliver more Blackwells in the current quarter than previously estimated, and that “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” “We’re expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map,” Huang said. “Everything is on track as far as I know. Nvidia’s shares were down 3.47% during after-hours trading on Wednesday after it released its earnings results. The shares remained down by 1.2% later in the evening. The chipmaker’s shares fell 6.9% in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal second quarter earnings in August. Nvidia had set fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above the average analysts were expecting, but below top end estimates.

US stocks recovered from steep losses Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers, has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the prices of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group, Kostin said, could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said, "We've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued, "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

US stocks recovered from steep losses Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4.

Target posted its biggest earnings miss in two years and cut its forecast. The company spoke about a "deceleration in discretionary demand" and blamed higher costs caused by the rush to move inventory ahead of the short-lived port strike in October. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Cornell described U.S. consumers who are "shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation" and holding out for the best possible deal. Walmart, on the other hand, hiked its full-year forecast. It said it's gaining upper-income shoppers and seeing better trends for sales of merchandise outside of the grocery department, even as consumers look for value. Customer traffic gains were similar at the two stores, yet Walmart's sales trends looked much better than Target's. Walmart's traffic growth edged out its rival's, with a gain of 3.1% at Walmart U.S. versus 2.4% at Target. Walmart's same-store sales rose 5.3%, while Target's increased only 0.3% year over year. Walmart's e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 22%, a bigger increase than the nearly 11% at Target. The sharp differences between the two big-box retailers — and how their businesses are executing in the same economic backdrop — illustrate where consumers are willing to spend money and where they are pulling back as they remain selective about spending. That sharp divergence of the winners and losers in the industry could become even starker as retailers enter their most crucial sales season of the year. Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Target's disappointing results reflect the company's performance rather than the health of consumers. "It's as simple as this: They are losing share," Baker said. "They are losing share to Walmart, Amazon and Costco." He said Target's inconsistent results over the past year are a warning sign about execution. The company has missed Wall Street's quarterly sales and earnings expectations in two quarters and beat on them in two other quarters. "That kind of back and forth makes you wonder if there's something going on internally," he said. Several equity research analysts, including Citi Research, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Global Research, downgraded Target's stock Wednesday, citing concerns that the Minneapolis-based retailer has lost shoppers and sales to competitors. Its stock dropped more than 20% in trading Wednesday. In a research note, Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst for Citi, said the company's poor results and weak outlook show Target is "likely losing share" to Walmart and risks losing more of the market unless it steps up promotions. One of the roots of Target's troubles is the company's merchandise mix, said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs. About 60% of Target's sales come from discretionary items, such as home goods and clothing. That's the opposite of Walmart, which draws about 60% of its sales from everyday necessities, such as groceries and household items such as paper towels. Those discretionary categories, which customers sometimes splurge or pull back on, explain "some of the volatility and the bumpiness you are seeing that is more specific to Target," she said. Both Walmart and Target mentioned the negative impact of the port strike, but Target appeared to put a major share of the blame for its weak quarter on the stoppage. D.A. Davidson's Baker said weak sales can "make those kinds of cost increases stand out more." Target has other questions that will factor into its future, including who will lead the company. Cornell, who has been chief executive since 2014, agreed in September 2022 to stay on as the company's leader for three more years. On a call with investors Wednesday, Cornell pointed to "green shoots" in the business, even as sales results disappointed. He spoke about customer traffic growth, online sales gains and relative strength in apparel sales, even as unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers from buying clothes for cooler temperatures. Yet on that same call, several analysts posed questions about Target's plans for the future. UBS equity research analyst Michael Lasser asked if Target needs to make changes or invest more in its business. Cornell said the company will stick with what it already does: offering unique items and national brands, opening new stores, expanding its advertising business and offering more ways for shoppers to buy online. "We'll continue on our current strategy, stay in step with the consumer and make sure Target's doing the things that consumers across America expect from us," he said. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Investors want to see a 'bullish' Nvidia in its earnings, analyst says

Time Published: 2024-11-20T20:11:46Z
Full Content:
After reporting record earnings for its fiscal second quarter on Aug. 30, Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.26%) shares tumbled after investors were left unimpressed by its guidance for the fiscal third quarter. With Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter results coming imminently, those expectations are still “incredibly high,” Daniel Newman, chief executive of The Futurum Group, told Quartz. “We know from the last quarter what happens if they are too conservative,” Newman said. “People want to see it be bullish.” Nvidia is still in the cycle where expectations are palpable and meeting expectations is not enough — investors want to hear a beat, Newman said. The chipmaker is expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.31%). “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia will have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. Investors are also expecting updates on Blackwell, both Belton and Newman said, separately, amid reports that the highly-anticipated artificial intelligence chips are overheating when connected on custom-designed server racks that combine 72 of the company’s GPUs, or graphics processing units. However, Dell (DELL+2.83%) said it has started shipping Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks, and Microsoft (MSFT0.00%) announced a private preview of the Blackwell AI infrastructure on its Azure cloud computing platform. Blackwell experienced production and shipping delays earlier this year due to a design flaw that was fixed, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports about the issue surfaced in August. Before Huang addressed the design flaw, Nvidia’s shares got a boost after he said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.” “People want confirmation on Blackwell and margin integrity,” Newman said, adding that Blackwell revenue will come into play during the next earnings cycle. “People want to see how much enthusiasm there is,” and if the numbers can provide a positive outlook that the market wants to hear. Nvidia has already announced its next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, which will come after Blackwell in 2026. The Rubin platform will include new GPUs and a new central processing unit (CPU) called Vera, as well as advanced networking chips. During the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker is “on a one-year rhythm” with producing new chips. Investors will want to hear Nvidia’s roadmap for Rubin and if it can sustain its annual cycle, as well as whether its small but mighty customer base can continue buying at a fast rate while delivering returns, Newman said. Additionally, investors will be interested in Nvidia’s ability to keep its 92% share of the data center GPU market, including its plans to maintain pricing power and growth on the path to a $4 trillion valuation. Meanwhile, “Nvidia’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. “Notably, Nvidia’s focus on incorporating AI into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO). What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry. Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations. Don’t Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook. Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes. By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company. Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so. If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline. Check It Out: Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

Title: Nvidia and the rest of the Magnificent 7 create a risky scenario for the market, strategist says

Andrew Krei, co-chief investment officer at Crescent Grove Advisors, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Sometimes even when they surpass expectations, the markets are unhappy, do they have to have blow out earnings for the markets to react positively? ANDREW KREI (AK): It speaks to the idea that whether you look at the valuation or the assumptions that go into Nvidia’s (NVDA) price are ultimately a high bar, right? The market is expecting that this AI growth theme continues for quite some period of time, that Nvidia continues to capture a large portion of market share, that their margins stay very healthy where they are now. And if there’s any sign that that story or that narrative is breaking in, in some way, shape, or form, then I think again, investors look at this with a very high bar. If Nvidia can’t exceed that bar, to your point, there’s disappointment around that. And I think it speaks to the broader AI theme as well. And some of the other companies that have been the poster children, the Magnificent Seven, those mega-cap tech names that have benefited from that narrative, just this idea that going forward, valuations are really demanding. Expectations are really demanding in terms of what investors are looking for around their execution on these themes. If they don’t meet those high bars going forward, they can’t exceed those, then that’s where you see the knee-jerk reaction of people selling off these stocks because that uncertainty starts to exist to a greater degree than where it has been before. AM: The majority of the growth in the indexes has been in the Mag Seven over the last couple of years. What risk does such market concentration pose? AK: I would say if you look historically at episodes where you have a significant amount of concentration at the top of markets, meaning the top 10 names or so, what they represent is a percentage of the aggregate market cap. Right now we’re in the 30% range, mid-thirties, something along those lines generally doesn’t end well, right? There’s just a huge amount of piling into these names that happens from investors that you create this momentum that begets buying, begets more buying, that sort of thing. Ultimately, when there is a reversal, of course, if the narrative does start to break, again, go back to the AI theme, right? If the execution isn’t absolutely spot on going forward, when you start to extrapolate the assumptions that are built into these stocks, that’s when you can start to see a wave of capital outflows from these names. And that’s again, historically speaking, what you’ve seen now are these businesses, they’re phenomenal businesses, right? I think it’s warranted the idea that their growth has exceeded the rest of the market and they’ve again, I think, been deserving of the status to be market leaders. When you look at the relative earnings growth over the last several years from our perspective and as we look forward and we think about investors, the basic portfolio management principles that we go to, we think about diversification and sort of this idea of how do you avoid some of those concentration risks. For us, it’s taken some chips off the table, rebalancing into other segments of the market that now the earnings growth picture starts to look a little bit more favorable. The expectations are coming down a little bit for earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT). The Magnificent Seven and earnings growth potential is ticking up for the, let’s call it “S&P 493”, the non-Magnificent Seven names. I think gives us the specter of a potential convergence in performance going forward, if not an outright rotational opportunity for investors, relative value going from something really highly valued to something that’s more reasonably valued in the market with fundamentals now that, again, start to converge a little bit. So that to us is the way to play it. But again, it’s been deserved, I think for the Magnificent Seven to see the gains that they’ve seen. AM: So in the other, the S&P 493, are there any sectors or companies you’re looking at that investors should consider investing in? AK: How we kind of frame it up is there’s tech, there’s the Mag Seven, the mega cap tech names, and then everything else. So there’s that very, very high-level taxonomy for us, and I think we just want to be a little more focused on the everything else bucket over the next, you know, 12-plus months and thinking about that relative value, rotation opportunity. But even within that, I would say value segments of the market. So that can be things like industrials, materials can be even things like consumer staples, healthcare, just these sort of segments that have been a little bit left for dead in some respects over the last several years because their earnings have been kinda middling. The growth hasn’t quite been there to the same magnitude that the tech earnings growth has been. We just think, again, there’s an opportunity for capital to flow into those segments. In particular, if we look at that forward-looking picture for the new administration, if there is gonna be more fiscal stimulus, if there’s gonna be deregulation, financials a big piece of the value index. You look at these other segments that could benefit from this pro-cyclical type of growth backdrop that we could see going forward. And that to us represents a compelling proposition relative to, again, these tech names that have done so well and now trade at really demanding valuations.

Title: Weight loss drug makers want more insurance plans to cover Wegovy and Zepbound

Time Published: 2024-11-20T16:14:00Z

Weight-loss drug makers are directly targeting employers in a campaign to expand health insurance coverage of their popular, but pricey, medications. The Wall Street Journal reports that reps for both Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.74%), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.29%), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro, are visiting labor unions and HR teams across the country to make the case for anti-obesity drugs. These treatments belong to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. The drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.05%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030, but that will hinge on patient access. However, insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the specific use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have been reluctant to cover these treatments due to their steep costs, which can significantly inflate employers’ healthcare budgets and drive up premiums across the board. Without insurance, Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. Only about 65 million, or 25%, of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight-loss drugs, according to data from consulting firm Leverage. The firm’s AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus database tracks the insurance coverage of weight-loss treatments of roughly 80% of Americans. The majority of GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage comes from state Medicaid plans. Leverage estimates that Medicaid plans, which are government programs for low-income families, provide weight-loss drug coverage for 31.6 million people. Medicare only covers these treatments if they are prescribed to treat a second condition in addition to weight loss. When it comes to private or employer-sponsored plans, these only provide GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage for 13.7 million people, according to the database. But because many employers don’t make the details of their plans public, Leverage estimates this number could be up to 24.4 million people. A recent survey revealed that only around 44% of U.S. employers with 500 or more employees offered coverage for weight-loss drugs in 2024. In response, drugmakers are emphasizing that addressing obesity and its related complications could lead to significant long-term savings in healthcare costs for employers. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been testing these medications to uncover any additional health benefits they might provide. This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes. Eli Lilly is also seeking approval for Zepbound to treat sleep apnea. Additionally, numerous studies suggest these medications may help with a range of conditions — from treating addictions and Alzheimer’s disease to reducing the risk of COVID-19-related deaths.

Title: China-based biotech Laekna teams up with Lilly to develop muscle preserving obesity drug

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Eli Lilly (LLY) and Hong Kong-listed Laekna (2105.HK) will collaborate to develop an experimental obesity drug that aims to help patients lose weight while preserving muscle, the biotech said on Wednesday. Why it matters Lilly is aiming to strengthen its position as a leader in the obesity treatment market, which is expected to hit $150 billion in revenue by the next decade. Last year, the company spent about $2 billion to acquire Versanis' drug that acts directly on fat cells, without prompting lean mass loss. Several other drugmakers including Regeneron and Scholar Rock are testing treatments that could help preserve muscle, which is often lost when patients lose weight through lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery or the use of GLP-1 treatments such as Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk (NVO)'s Wegovy. Context The collaboration will accelerate the development of Laekna's experimental drug, LAE102, which belongs to a class of drugs that play a key role in muscle regeneration as well as the breakdown and storage of fat for energy. Lilly will fund the development of the drug and share its resources and expertise, but Laekna will retain the global rights for the drug and plans to advance the early-stage trial of the drug in China. Laekna said the drug has shown to increase lean mass and decrease fat mass in lab studies. In combination with a GLP-1 treatment, it could further reduce fat mass and help patients significantly regain the lean mass lost during weight loss.

Title: Weight loss drug makers still have huge upside, and the market overreacted to RFK Jr. named to top health role, BMO says

Shares of pharmaceutical companies that produce popular weight loss drugs have tumbled since president-elect Donald Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, but analysts at BMO Capital Markets said this week that the selloff is overdone. Since Kennedy's nomination last Thursday, stocks like Wegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Zepbound maker Eli Lilly have lost 3% and 7%, respectively. Other weight loss drug stocks like Amgen and Structure Therapeutics, meanwhile, have fallen 5% and 13%. The selloffs "reflect more fear than real fundamental downside risk," the analysts argued in a note. They say Kennedy's role as the top health leader in the US comes with limited ability to actually change policy that would impact the pricing and availability of the drugs. As a result, there is likely little risk to the shares of companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. "The head of HHS is typically a more administrative position," the analysts said. Kennedy has previously pledged to fight obesity with nutrition instead of GLP-1 drugs. In an interview with Fox News last month, he pointed to a bill that would make Ozempic available to overweight Americans, which would cost $3 trillion per year, he said. He suggested those funds would be better used for other initiatives. "If we spend about one-fifth of that giving good food, three meals a day to every man, woman, and child in our country, we can solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight for a tiny fraction of the cost," he said. In reality, though, the health secretary has limited actual authority to influence either GLP-1 drug pricing or the passage of future bills like the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which expands Medicare coverage to cover weight loss drugs, the BMO analysts said. If a public health emergency was declared, the secretary could adjust Medicare reimbursement for some "Part B" drugs, but weight loss drugs fall under "Part D," the analysts say. "While RFK Jr. appears less optimistic on the use of incretins to curb the obesity crisis, he remains limited in his ability to influence either policy or pricing of obesity medications," the analysts said. As a result, weight loss drugs still have massive potential, the analysts said, pointing to Novo Nordisk's recent Wegovy launch in China, which has a largely untapped potential market of around 180 million obese adults. "Importantly, China's national healthcare will not cover Wegovy, and upcoming patent expiration may limit long-term sales in the geography, but we continue to highlight the significant size of patient population and prevalence of cash payment in China may be a tailwind that benefits Novo going forward," the analysts say. The analysts maintain their $156 price target for Novo Nordisk stock, implying 52% upside from current levels, as well as a price target of $1010 for Eli Lilly, a potential 38% rise. Kennedy's nomination also sparked a sell-off in health stocks more broadly, particularly among vaccine makers like Moderna, Pfizer, and GSK, as well as a range of European healthcare stocks with exposure to the US market. Kennedy has been a vocal skeptic of vaccines, once calling those that protect against COVID-19 a "crime against humanity." The sector's losses stand out from much of the rest of the market, which has rallied on the hopes that Trump's deregulatory policies and corporate tax cuts will boost profitability.

Title: What Trump 2.0 means for tech and AI regulation
URL: https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2024/11/what-trump-20-means-tech-and-ai-regulation/401161/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
MIT professor Max Tegmark and Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson discuss what AI policy might look like under the next Trump Administration at the 2024 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Camille Tuutti Stay Connected By Camille Tuutti A second Trump administration could reshape U.S. and global tech industries, with deregulation, artificial intelligence safety and Elon Musk’s growing influence at the forefront. These potential shifts were discussed at Lisbon’s Web Summit during the Nov. 12 session “A New Trump Era,” moderated by NPR CEO Katherine Maher. “Pod Save the People” host DeRay Mckesson and “West Wing” actor Richard Schiff explored how Trump’s second presidency might impact the tech world. Schiff began the session by comparing tech’s growing influence to that of the oil industry, highlighting its ability to drive policy and accumulate wealth. “I think Elon Musk has already doubled his wealth since last Tuesday,” he said. “And tech to me . . . might very likely be the new oil in that it's going to affect policy because the money is there and the power is there.” Schiff said he doubted the Trump administration would regulate tech or address monopolies, a stance he said benefits the industry but raises equity concerns. “The most important tech person in the world has now become the shadow vice president and, if not more, so I think the tech industry is going to get whatever they want,” he said, referring to Musk. “Are we going to stop monopolies? Probably not. Are we going to regulate? Probably not. Maybe that's great for tech, I don't know. I don't know how good it is for the world, the country.” Mckesson turned the conversation to Musk’s leadership, criticizing his tenure at X for making the platform more ideological, despite Musk’s claims to oppose such tendencies. He compared Musk’s polarizing approach to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s growing reputation as a more moderate leader. “[Zuckerberg] was a villain for so long in Silicon Valley,” Mckesson said. “Now, he's sort of the sane person left standing, it seems. So it'll be interesting to see what he does with WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook — these places that are in the ecosystem that is not Twitter.” Maher then shifted the discussion to AI, asking whether a stronger AI sector could bolster national security. Schiff offered a cultural perspective, suggesting that tough times often ignite creativity. “The silver lining, for me, might be that in authoritarian societies, the best art comes out of the more compressed artists feel, the more expression they end up having,” he said. “There's that darkness that there's light somewhere.” Musk’s role in the Trump administration At a Nov. 13 panel titled “Did Elon Musk Destroy Twitter?” panelists examined Musk’s leadership style and its implications as the proposed head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Kate Conger, a New York Times tech reporter, argued Musk’s drastic cost-cutting measures at X could serve as a blueprint for how he might address federal bureaucracy. “Musk's campaign to downsize Twitter is really a model for what he wants to do for the federal government, and in a lot of ways, it's empowered him to pursue this role,” she said. She pointed to Musk’s perceived success in maintaining X operations after massive layoffs that gutted 75% of the workforce. “Despite some small outages, it still has continued to run, and so he must feel very empowered by that and feels that he can make these deep cuts to the government and bureaucracy,” she said Ryan Mac, another New York Times tech reporter, brought up Musk’s potential conflicts of interest leading DOGE. Tesla and SpaceX, both of which rely on federal contracts, are under at least 20 federal investigations, according to NYT reporting, he said. As DOGE head, Musk could wield significant influence over the agencies regulating his companies, Mac added. “If there is a situation at the [Federal Aviation Administration], which oversees Tesla and SpaceX, could [Musk] have his finger on the scale to change what the FAA does?” Mac asked. “We just don't know. I think that potential is pretty scary.” AI policy and power concentration Trump has suggested rolling back President Joe Biden's 2023 executive order on AI, a move that could shutter the U.S. AI Safety Institute. Part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the institute addresses risks to national security, public safety and individual rights. During the panel “Is AI the Answer or the Problem?” Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson explored whether Musk’s outspoken concerns about AI risks might influence Trump to adopt stricter AI policies instead of loosening regulations to compete with China. She asked MIT professor Max Tegmark if Musk’s views could shape Trump’s approach to AI governance. “I hope so,” Tegmark said, stressing the need to educate leaders about AI’s dangers. “You don't actually need to persuade them that they shouldn't want to be replaced by and dominated by some new weird machine species. They are already against that. It's just a matter of education.” Tegmark expressed optimism that Musk could help Trump grasp the national security risks posed by uncontrolled AI and the economic importance of building safe, manageable AI. “I'm definitely hoping that Elon can help Donald Trump understand that this is just not in America's national security interests that American companies build something that we lose control over in two years, and that the real path to prosperity in America and even strength is to build AI tools that can be controlled,” he said. Olson also highlighted the growing concentration of AI power, pointing out how companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google are snapping up smaller startups. Tegmark identified two major risks: the dominance of a few companies and humanity losing control over powerful AI systems. Despite these concerns, Tegmark ended on a hopeful note, highlighting AI’s potential to solve global challenges if developed responsibly. “With AI, there's so many things we would love to do but just haven't figured out how to do — prevent our loved ones from dying of diseases and safeguard our climate and so on and so forth,” he said. “And if we can get this right with tool AI, we can have a more amazing future than we ever dreamt of.” This year’s Web Summit attracted over 71,500 attendees from around the globe, according to a LinkedIn post by the event's organizers, including industry leaders, policymakers and innovators.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) reported third quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday that topped expectations on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips fueling what its CEO Jensen Huang called the "age of AI." The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion. Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. Nvidia's stock price fell roughly 3% in premarket trading on Thursday, as investors weighed the forecast. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference." The chip giant's Data Center business, which makes up the vast majority of its revenue, brought in $30.8 billion in the quarter, beating out analysts' expectations of $29 billion and jumping 112% versus the $14.5 billion the segment made in Q3 last year. Nvidia's gaming revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up from the $2.8 billion the division brought in last year. Analysts were looking for $3 billion. Nvidia's stock has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond.

Nvidia also appeared to assuage concerns about potential slowdowns in the availability of its next-generation Blackwell chip, with CFO Colette Kress saying that the AI GPU will begin shipping in the current quarter and ramp into the year ahead. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," she added. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? Shares of Nvidia were up 192% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given that Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) will report its third quarter earnings after the bell today, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the artificial intelligence trade. The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 196% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3, but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Even if the AI chip leader delivers a stellar report and outlook, its share price could still fall. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but its stock dropped 6% immediately after its results. That could be a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains. Investors will also be looking for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production would pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he anticipated that would continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, was expected to continue selling well into Q4. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers — a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Election 2024 coverage presented by This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,981.79 +0.61% Bitcoin (BTC): $93,634.61 +2.04% Ether (ETH): $3,090.71 -1.65% S&P 500: 5,916.98 +0.40% Gold: $2,628.53 -0.15% Nikkei 225: 38,352.34 -0.16% Bitcoin (BTC) is eyeing record highs once again heading into Wednesday's U.S. session. The largest crypto is trading just below $94,000, the new record from Tuesday, and leading the broader market with a 2% climb over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was little changed and large-cap altcoins ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) fell. Options on BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw staggering first-day trading activity yesterday, pushing the BTC price higher, analysts noted. Most of the activity focused on calls, representing a bullish view, with some traders betting on a doubling of IBIT's share price. "It’s pretty interesting to see 'professionals' degen into $100 strikes (this effectively means a doubling of BTC prices given IBIT trades near $50)," crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal noted. Options on other BTC ETFs will follow in the coming days, fueling more activity. It's not only bitcoin where the crypto action is concentrated, though. Trading volumes for popular altcoins dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP (XRP) surpassed BTC's on South Korean crypto exchanges Upbit and Bithumb. MicroStrategy (MSTR) broke into the top 100 U.S. publicly traded companies by market capitalization as its share price closed Tuesday's session at a record $430, far above its dotcom bubble highs. The firm owns the largest corporate bitcoin treasury in the world and its shares have rallied 528% this year, outperforming bitcoin and chipmaker giant Nvidia (NVDA). The developments keep coming for the firm, CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten noted. On Monday, it announced a $1.75 billion 5-year convertible senior note issuance at a 0% coupon. "We are waiting on further developments if this convertible note has been oversubscribed, which would increase its issuance by $250 million, for a total of $2 billion," Van Straten said. Robinhood (HOOD) is poised to benefit the most from crypto deregulation in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, broker Bernstein said in a report. The trading app can drive higher revenues by listing new tokens and introducing new crypto product lines to target the wider opportunity, the report said. Robinhood's acquisition of EU-based exchange Bitstamp and its European platform should "further boost value added crypto services," the authors wrote. Bernstein raised the price target for Robinhood shares to $51 from $30, which would translate to a 45% appreciation from Tuesday's closing price. - Omkar Godbole Coinbase Delists Wrapped Bitcoin wBTC, Citing 'Listing Concerns' Crypto Exchange Archax to Offer Tokenized Money Market Funds from State Street, Fidelity International and LGIM Meta's Mark Zuckerberg Could Teach DAOs, Like Compound, a Governance Lesson Edited by Sheldon Reback.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down about 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 0.5%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.7%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. Investors are counting down to Nvidia's results after the bell, hoping the last of the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps to report can provide some fresh momentum for stocks. It's seen as a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to the two-year bull market. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, has seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the presidential election. The European Central Bank has warned of a bubble in AI stocks amid high concentration and the risk that lofty earnings hopes won't be met. Nvidia's share price was down almost 2%, after surging on Tuesday to buoy the Nasdaq to a win. Traders are bracing for a potential post-earnings swing of 8% — or $300 billion in market value — in either direction, going by options markets. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM) have seen declines of more than 12%, 6% and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the price of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group Kostin said could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM) and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said: "[W]e've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma Inc," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued: "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

In a November 19 Twitter Space discussion hosted by Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck, the Bitcoin maximalist announced that he has agreed to deliver a concise, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s leadership. The pitch comes amidst a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to assess Bitcoin’s potential impact on its balance sheet. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a 3-minute presentation,” Saylor said. “That’s all you’re allowed—and I’m going to present it to the board of directors” A staunch advocate of Bitcoin, Saylor criticized corporations with large cash reserves for “burning shareholder value,” during yesterday's the Twitter space discussion. In his view, Bitcoin can bring great stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky stock if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he stated. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 252,220 BTC valued at $16.8 billion, believes Bitcoin is a necessary asset for companies with large cash reserves. He shared during the discussion that his earlier request for a private meeting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to discuss the topic has not yet been accepted. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 In October, Saylor directly addressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Twitter, saying, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment on Dec. 10. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) introduced the proposal last month, citing MicroStrategy’s success with Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed Microsoft’s by 313% this year, even though the company operates at a much smaller scale. “MicroStrategy, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, it holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet,” noted NCPPR in the proposal. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal. Microsoft maintains that it already evaluates a broad range of investment options, including Bitcoin. The company’s share price traded relatively modest on Wednesday, increasing 0.49% to $417.79, Google Finance data shows. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Why Nvidia earnings could be a sink-or-swim moment for this bull market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure. Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally. Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday. "It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance," said Essaye. "It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print." Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year. The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous. To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday. "Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally]," said Essaye. Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — "priced to perfection" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning. But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this "bellwether" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years. "They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far," he said. "I think they can do it again."

Title: Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies. All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers. Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well. To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight. Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year. Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026. As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power. The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively. While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components. While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year. Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period. Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year. The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67. In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions. Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand. Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2. I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood. Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters. As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge. For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations). This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4. It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again. This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%. On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026: Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints. The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month. TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity. By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023. Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%.

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies.

Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars.

Title: Pulling in top talent: The work perks that really matter
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/11/20/the-work-perks-that-really-matter/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T06:00:00Z

From performance bonuses to babysitting, Deliveroo vouchers to doggy day care, employee benefits packages have got a whole lot more interesting. Big employers use headline-grabbing benefits to position themselves as desirable and to attract top talent. From carpooling to counselling, grocery delivery to co-working hub vouchers, some companies are even offering free babysitting to make sure knackered staff get out on date night. But which perks are worth the most, and how do you make sure you are getting everything available? In addition to salary, good benefits increase an employer’s chance of beating others to the best staff. Some benefits are arguably aimed at a specific demographic only, leaving other applicants cold. This may be a strategy. Would you be persuaded by seemingly generous doggy day-care vouchers and Just Eat delivery? These benefits signal that new hires can expect to be time-poor, unable to commit to mealtimes at home, or to responsibilities outside of work. They are likely to be aimed at attracting those for whom the office can be dominant in their lives — they won’t require being away from it much. If that’s where you are at, then these perks can pay off in the short term. A dog sitter in Dublin city for example is about €25 a day, or about €4,500 a year for someone in the office four days a week. Those travelling for business can expect to pay €35 for overnight dog sitting. If you’re offered food delivery credits as a perk, know that how you use them may be restricted. In October, staff at Meta in the US were fired for eating the meal at home instead of the office. Meta, like many big tech companies, offers free food to employees based out of its Silicon Valley headquarters. Staff in smaller offices without a canteen are offered Uber Eats or Grubhub credits, for example, for food to be delivered to the office. They are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and $25 for dinner. Employees who were getting the meals sent home when they were required to only eat the food in the office were fired. Some perks leave a bad taste. Less than one per cent of employers offer anything by way of childcare vouchers, says Trayc Keevans of Morgan McKinley survey. What’s the benefit the employees in Ireland most care about? No, it’s not doggy day care that’s really keeping us awake at night, but rather how to pay for our lives once we retire. Pension tops the list of the most desired benefits, according to a survey of 3,400 professionals and 650 employers globally as part of a 2024 report by recruiter Morgan McKinley. “We are seeing employees younger than ever before actually looking at pension,” says Trayc Keevans, Morgan McKinley Ireland’s global foreign direct investment director. “It wasn’t as important before, but in the most recent survey, right across the board, pension was an important benefit,” says Keevans. By 2046, Irish men can expect to live to 85 and women to 89. So if you retire at the current State pension age of 66, you’ll have about 20 years of living after your last pay cheque. [ Has Fingal County Council found a solution to Ireland’s housing crisis?Opens in new window ] If you start to save for retirement at age 30, on a salary of €40,000, you will need to set aside a minimum of 18 per cent of gross salary every year until age 66 to get an income of €2,000 a month in today’s money – and that’s including the State pension, according to Pensions Authority calculations. With parenthood and home ownership happening later than ever, the cost of supporting children and paying a mortgage is now stretching past retirement age. Housing costs mean more people will be renting in retirement too. This is bringing employer pension contributions into sharp focus for employees. Don’t just ask a prospective employer if there’s a pension, ask about the terms, says Keevan. Some are only finding out when it comes to contract signing that the terms are less generous than their current employer. Know the contribution from your current employer at least get that matched, says Keevans. Smaller companies will usually pay pension contributions of between 3 and 6 per cent, matching your contribution, she says. “Standard in a midsize to multinational company would be from 5 per cent matching up to manager level,” says Keevans. “Above that, a company might make contributions of anything up to 10 or 12 per cent. The larger multinationals will go even higher,” she says. “The best pension I have seen was a 19 per cent employer contribution, with the employee being asked to make a contribution of 4 per cent, bringing it up to 23 per cent.” Ask if pension entitlements increase as you climb the ranks. Employer pension contributions nudge up when you reach a certain age in some companies. Knowing this can help inform your job hunting. Paid private health insurance is the second most valued employee benefit, according to the Morgan McKinley research. A separate survey of 1,000 adults by Dooley Insurance Group puts health insurance top of the heap with 56 per cent of employees prioritising it. More than three in 10 of us didn’t go to a healthcare appointment because we could not afford it, according to an Irish Cancer Society survey last month [November]. One in four, meanwhile, felt we must prioritise other costs over healthcare. With the average adult paying €1,685 a year for health insurance, according to the Health Insurance Authority figures, this is a valuable perk for your health and your pocket. “We find at manager level and above, the policy covers the spouse and dependents as well,” says Keevans. Families with two adults and two children can pay up to €5,000 a year for insurance cover. You’ll need to earn about €10,000 to pay for that out of after-tax income. The cost isn’t the only benefit with paid health insurance, but rather access to basic treatment in a reasonable time frame. Almost two-fifths of people put off a medical appointment due to pressures in the system, according to the Irish Cancer Society survey. Working from home takes the third spot as the most valued employee benefit, says Morgan McKinley survey. Remote working was also highly rated by participants in the Dooley Insurances survey, with 35 per cent placing significant value on it. Remote working saves on transport and clothing costs. Coupled with flexible working, it may even enable some households to save on before and after-school care. This can mean significant savings. Only about a fifth of those eligible are claiming the remote work tax credit, according to Revenue figures. The credit for a year averages about €40 to €60, so there’s no boon here. The real pay-off is work-life balance, and job candidates are negotiating hard on this. “If they take a holiday in Spain every year, they might ask to tag on another few weeks and work from there, if that’s permissible,” says Keevans. “They are asking for a ‘work from anywhere’ policy in their contract that would allow them to do that. That’s quite attractive and we’ve seen a lot of people negotiate that.” Companies are still grappling with how many weeks an employee can work out of the country, before triggering tax liabilities there, she says. “Companies are tending to be quite conservative in guesstimating what that will be, the most we have seen is six weeks, but we see a lot of reluctance to it.” Flexibility around working patterns remains a prominent request. “Somebody might be joining a company where the standard is three days a week in the office, but it’s moving to four days. They might negotiate to move it back to three, but that can be difficult in the current climate,” says Keevans. New hires could negotiate an initial period of office time to get to build relationships and understand the culture, with that being reviewed, she says. Who doesn’t love a bonus? If this is part of the package, it’s important to understand what’s on offer. “Is it tied to your personal contribution and meeting personal performance metrics such as sales quotas, project milestones, performance reviews or KPIs? [key performance indicators]” says Keevans. “We see some employers and if the company isn’t performing, there’s no bonus for anyone and if it is performing, then the individual performance piece is cleared for payment,” she says. “The better you perform, the better chance you have of a bonus, but again, it tends to be predicated on the company performing first.” Exceptions to retain top talent can be made, rewarding them even when the company isn’t performing, she says. If a new employer needs you to join pronto, but that means missing out on the bonus at your old job, then negotiate on this. “They may pay you a sign-on bonus to offset what you are losing,” says Keevans. Shares can be great, but only if you know what to do with them. “In most cases, it’s a share purchase scheme that is offered. This is where you can buy shares in the company through salary sacrifice or bonus, usually at a discounted rate,” says David Looney or Alpha Wealth. Typically if these shares are held for three years, you don’t have to pay tax on the benefit, so the only tax due will be capital gains on any increase in their value if sold. Sometimes senior staff are offered stock options or restricted share units. Stock options are where you are allowed to buy a specific amount of shares at a fixed price in the future. If the share price is more than that price at the time you buy, happy days. Options usually have an expiration date, so a perk like this requires ongoing review to assess if it makes sense to buy at a particular time. Share prices can go up and down of course, and things can change quickly. You may benefit from independent financial advice. “We meet clients with little in their pensions, large mortgages and car loans, little in other savings and investments, and then have hundreds of thousands worth of Google stock that they are too afraid to sell,” says David Looney. “You can benefit from tax-free gains of €1,270 a year if selling, previous capital losses can be offset against gains too, but I would encourage anyone with a large amount of shares, six figures, to ignore this and put risk management above tax efficiency,” he says. Selling company stock and investing the proceeds in a more diversified way means all your eggs aren’t in your employer’s basket. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor to present Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.

Title: Asian shares cautious before Nvidia result, dollar gives back gains

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Chibuike Oguh and Amanda Cooper NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global shares edged lower on Wednesday as markets weighed tensions between Russia and the West, while bitcoin hit a new record high and the dollar gained after three straight sessions of losses. Shares of Nvidia were down 0.4% in after-market trading after the artificial intelligence powerhouse forecast fourth-quarter revenue that was largely in line with analyst estimates. The stock of the world's most valuable company had closed down 0.8% in regular hours trading on Wednesday. Benchmark S&P 500 finished flat while the Dow gained and the Nasdaq ended lower. Healthcare, energy and materials stocks were the biggest gainers, while consumer discretionary, financials and technology equities were the biggest drag. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32% to 43,408.47, the S&P 500 was flat at 5,917.11 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.11% to 18,966.14. The MSCI All-World index was down 0.16% to 847.84. European shares finished down 0.02%. "Nvidia is obviously a bellwether stock for the market and it seems to be down a little bit after market, but it wasn't a catastrophe by any stretch of the imagination," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California. "The bar keeps getting raised and raised and raised. But eventually it just becomes really difficult to exceed that bar. And I think that's kind of where we're at with Nvidia." Safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds got a lift on Tuesday after news of Ukraine launching U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia, and with Russia announcing it had lowered the threshold for nuclear action. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, however, later downplayed the nuclear threat, helping to calm markets. Gold prices climbed for a third consecutive session to mark a one-week high. Spot gold rose 0.69% to $2,649.89 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.8% higher at $2,651.70. Investors are also watching President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, which may come as soon as Wednesday. Markets were realizing that some of Trump policies, including tariffs and deportations, could be inflationary, said Lukasz Tomicki, founding partner at LRT Capital in Austin, Texas. "There's been this belief that Trump's policies will be inflationary and we've seen the spike in yields since his election," Tomicki said. The dollar index rose 0.54% to 106.68, snapping three consecutive sessions of losses but still below one-year highs. It has gained nearly 3% since the Nov. 5 U.S. general election. The dollar was last up 0.48% against the yen at 155.40. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was up 0.2% at 0.88410. The Chinese yuan weakened against the greenback after the central bank held benchmark lending rates steady, as widely expected. In the offshore market, the yuan was down 0.22% against the dollar at 7.251. Bitcoin, which hit a fresh record high just shy of $95,000, was up 2.53% at $94,579.01. The price has risen by well over 30% since Trump's election, buoyed by expectations that he will create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. The gains in bitcoin have been aided by a Financial Times report that Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social and is majority-owned by Trump, is close to an all-stock acquisition of crypto trading firm Bakkt. Oil prices settled lower after U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose by more than expected last week. Brent crude futures for January settled 0.68% at $72.81. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for December expired on Wednesday, and settled down 0.75% at $68.87, while the more active WTI contract for January settled down 0.71% at $68.75.

OPINION It is a rare retailer whose shares trade at a premium to those of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But there are merchants, and then there is Walmart. Operationally, the 800-pound gorilla of American retail is in a class of its own. While others have struggled to entice inflation-weary consumers to open their wallets, comparable sales at Walmart US grew 5.3% during the third quarter. That handily trounced expectations for a 3.7% rise, which is no small feat given Walmart’s size. It pulled in US$648 billion ($1.096 trillion) in revenue last year. Adding to the flex, Walmart upped its full-year guidance for a second time this year. True, the stock itself is no bargain after climbing nearly 64% this year. It trades on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33. That beats not only direct rival Target, but also Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and smartphone supremo Apple, according to financial markets data provider London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). But this premium is deserved. Walmart has navigated the challenges of a lukewarm economy and inflation with aplomb by drawing in higher income customers and growing alternative revenue streams. It continued to take market shares from rivals in both groceries and general merchandise during the third quarter. Upper-income households making US$100,000 ($169,000) a year or more accounted for about three-quarters of the share gains during that period, the company said. Operating profit is also growing faster than sales thanks to its array of higher-margin side businesses. These include a third-party online marketplace, digital advertising and an Amazon Prime-like membership scheme called Walmart Plus. All these are fast growing and more profitable. This has allowed Walmart to keep prices low on food — and even cut them — to drive traffic and put pressure on rivals. Few other bricks-and-mortar retailers can claim to be able to do the same. Tighter inventory management also contributed to the rise in gross margins during the quarter. A strong dollar and proposed tariff plans touted by President-elect Donald Trump are some of the potential issues that could hurt Walmart. About a fifth of its sales come from outside the United States and the greenback’s rise this year could reduce the value of its non-dollars earnings abroad. But these should be more than manageable. Walmart’s size and diversified business model mean it has managed nearly a decade of uninterrupted like-for-like sales growth. It may not grow as fast as tech, but its prospects do not rely on having to invent whole new business models — and there are fewer regulators with an itch to break it up. Its shares are unlikely to find themselves in the clearance aisles anytime soon. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

With companies investing heavily in AI infrastructure, the continued demand for Nvidia’s A100, H100 chips and Blackwell, will likely play a pivotal role in this quarter’s performance. While demand remains robust, any disruption in chip production or supply chain logistics could constrain Nvidia’s ability to meet orders. Recent geopolitical tensions add to these uncertainties. With inflation moderating, consumer spending on gaming hardware is picking up, which could positively influence Nvidia’s gaming division. However, a potential slowdown in enterprise IT spending could temper overall growth. Those impacting export licenses could significantly influence NVDA stock earnings, especially given its reliance on Chinese markets. AI has become the crown jewel of Nvidia’s growth strategy. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used in everything from chatbots to advanced analytics. Generative AI, in particular, has catapulted demand, with Nvidia benefiting from its early investments in AI-centric architectures. Data centers represent another growth engine. Nvidia’s dominance in this space, with products like the DGX SuperPOD, has solidified its position as the go-to provider for scalable AI infrastructure. Revenue from this segment has consistently surpassed expectations, demonstrating the increasing reliance of enterprises on Nvidia’s technology. AI-driven advancements continue to propel Nvidia stock earnings, as the company solidifies its leadership in GPUs for large-scale computing and AI applications. The gaming sector, once Nvidia’s bread and butter, continues to be a key contributor to its revenue. The company’s RTX 40 series GPUs have been well-received, boosting revenue in recent quarters. Post-pandemic, the gaming industry experienced a slowdown, but recent data suggests a recovery. The resurgence of the gaming market has contributed positively to NVDA stock earnings, with the RTX 40 series outperforming competitor offerings. Nvidia’s efforts to optimize its products for gamers while capitalizing on AI-enhanced gaming experiences have positioned it favorably in this evolving market. In the race for AI dominance, Nvidia has maintained a significant lead over competitors like AMD and Intel. Its proprietary CUDA platform and robust ecosystem give it a clear edge in AI training and inference workloads. While AMD has made strides with its MI300 chips, they have yet to achieve the widespread adoption Nvidia enjoys. Similarly, Intel faces delays in delivering competitive GPU solutions. This disparity reinforces Nvidia’s leadership in both innovation and market share.

Analysts anticipate Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share on revenues of $33.12 billion, marking another record-breaking quarter. Analysts forecast robust figures for Nvidia stock earnings and growth, which reflects surging demand for AI-driven technologies and expanding market penetration. However, the projections come with a caveat: Nvidia’s high valuation means any miss could lead to significant market volatility. As a result, investor expectations are tempered with caution despite the bullish outlook. Historically, NVDA stock earnings drive volatility, as investors anticipate results from Nvidia's high-growth markets like AI and gaming. Nvidia’s stock tends to rally in the weeks leading up to earnings announcements, driven by optimism around its performance. However, the stock also sees heightened volatility, reflecting mixed sentiment among traders and institutional investors. Recent trading sessions suggest a cautious yet positive trend, with Nvidia shares holding steady near all-time highs. Investor sentiment surrounding Nvidia remains overwhelmingly bullish, with analysts largely assigning "Buy" ratings. Consensus price target by analysts for NVDA stock stands at $160.38 currently. Bullish sentiment around NVDA earnings reflects confidence in Nvidia’s AI capabilities and broader growth outlook. Firms like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have reiterated their confidence in Nvidia, citing its leadership in AI and robust revenue growth. However, concerns about valuation and macroeconomic risks have tempered enthusiasm among some investors, who worry about potential downside if growth slows. While AI is a growth driver, Nvidia’s dependence on this single sector makes it vulnerable to any slowdown in AI adoption or spending. As a major chip exporter, Nvidia is exposed to trade restrictions and regulatory challenges, particularly concerning China. Regulatory restrictions on exports to China remain a key factor that could dampen Nvidia stock earnings. Although currently dominant, advances by AMD and Intel could erode Nvidia’s market share if the company fails to maintain its innovation pace. The growing adoption of AI across industries ensures a long runway for Nvidia’s growth. From healthcare to finance, the company’s GPUs are pivotal in enabling AI-driven transformations. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is gaining traction among automakers, offering another lucrative growth avenue. As the metaverse concept evolves, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform positions it to capitalize on this next wave of digital innovation. For a deeper analysis of Nvidia's long-term potential, read Nvidia in 5 years. Nvidia’s earnings report is poised to reflect its dominance in the AI and data center markets. While risks persist, the company’s robust growth trajectory and leadership in innovation make it a stock to watch closely. Investors should prepare for potential volatility as Nvidia navigates its high-stakes earnings season. Nvidia’s earnings reports often lead to significant stock price movements due to its high valuation and investor interest in its growth story. The data center and gaming sectors are Nvidia’s largest revenue drivers, with data centers recently accounting for over 70% of total revenue. Nvidia maintains a strong lead over AMD and Intel in AI and data center markets, thanks to its advanced GPUs and robust ecosystem. With strong demand for AI, data centers, and gaming hardware, Nvidia’s growth trajectory appears sustainable, barring macroeconomic disruptions. Key risks include overreliance on AI, geopolitical tensions, and increasing competition from AMD and Intel.

Title: The S&P 500 is about to have a big year, Goldman Sachs says — even without the 'Magnificent 7'

After Morgan Stanley’s (MS+0.05%) bullish outlook, another financial giant has joined the optimistic chorus for the S&P 500 in 2025. What’s more, it expects the growth of the S&P 500 to occur without relying on the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven, marking a notable shift in market dynamics. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs’ (GS+0.87%) chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, released a report projecting an 11% rise in the S&P 500, with the index expected to hit 6,500 by the end of 2025. This aligns closely with Morgan Stanley’s forecast, which set the same target just a day earlier. Goldman’s analysts anticipate that the dominance of the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks — Apple Inc. (AAPL+0.41%), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT0.00%), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN-0.44%), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL-1.80%) (the parent company of Google), Meta Platforms Inc. (META-1.30%) (formerly Facebook), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA-3.26%) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA+4.25%) — may taper off in 2025. While these companies have driven significant market gains in recent years, analysts suggest that their influence might narrow as broader sectors contribute more evenly to market growth. The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks have significantly outpaced the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 over the past few years. In 2023, these seven companies delivered a remarkable 63 percentage points of outperformance over the rest of the index and have continued their dominance in 2024, outperforming by 22 percentage points year-to-date. However, this gap is expected to narrow in 2025. According to consensus estimates, the outperformance margin is projected to shrink to just seven percentage points. Similarly, the earnings per share (EPS) growth premium enjoyed by the Magnificent Seven is expected to narrow significantly in 2025. In 2024, the seven tech giants outpaced the rest of the S&P 500 by a robust 30 percentage points in EPS growth. However, this advantage is forecasted to shrink dramatically, with the EPS growth premium for the Magnificent Seven expected to compress to just 6 percentage points in 2025. This slowdown signals a broader market transition, with other sectors poised to deliver stronger performance and gradually erode the dominance of these high-flying tech stocks. It suggests a potential diversification of market leadership, as contributions to overall growth become more evenly distributed across a wider range of industries in the coming year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 5% on Tuesday, following bullish notes from Wall Street analysts citing strong chip demand ahead of its earnings report set for Wednesday afternoon. In a client note this week, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $180 from $165, while Truist Securities' William Stein raised his price outlook to $167 from $148. Roy cited "a diverse set of data points," including continued high spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers and demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips. "We believe that NVDA is well positioned in markets that combine to yield an overall TAM [total addressable market, or revenue opportunity] of more than $100 billion exiting 2025 and a longer-term opportunity funnel that could approach $1 trillion,” Roy wrote. Nvidia stock also rose on news that one of its customers, cloud provider Nebius Group (NBIS), is launching its first GPU cluster in the US, which will use up to 35,000 Nvidia chips. A GPU cluster is a network of graphics processing units, or AI chips, with massive compute power used to train and run artificial intelligence software. For reference, Nebius' order of 35,000 Nvidia chips is equivalent to about 4% of the volume of Hopper AI chips Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to have shipped in the October period, Bloomberg consensus data shows. Nvidia declined to comment on the deal. Nvidia stock’s climb comes a day after shares fell on a report by the Information about overheating issues with its Blackwell AI servers. In August, Nvidia was reportedly dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves, which prompted the company to push back the chips' production ramp to the January quarter. Nvidia has not confirmed overheating issues with its Blackwell servers, and the company told Yahoo Finance Monday that "the engineering iterations are normal and expected." Truist Securities’ Stein said of the overheating issues reported this week, “Conversations with our industry contacts don't precisely corroborate this latest data point, but they do reflect supply chain challenges around the production ramp.” Despite reported Blackwell issues, Dell Technologies (DELL) said it has already shipped its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge system, with Nvidia’s latest GB200 NVL72 systems. “[C]ommentary from NVDA, partners, and our industry contacts feel overwhelmingly positive,” Stein wrote in a note to investors. He pointed to emerging demand for Nvidia chips in the robotics and “traditional” computing sectors as well as that from AI software developers. KeyBanc analysts took a more cautious outlook on Nvidia ahead of earnings, lowering their earnings and revenue outlook for Nvidia for the January quarter, citing a squeeze on demand in China for Nvidia H20 chips. "We believe H20 demand in China is getting pushed out as there is increased pressure among China hyperscalers to use domestic AI solutions," they wrote in a note on Tuesday. They also stated fears that Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips could cannibalize Nvidia's prior-generation Hopper chips. "Regarding H200, we are hearing that some demand is getting pushed out given the availability of Blackwell (B200)." KeyBanc lowered its fiscal fourth quarter sales guidance for Nvidia to $37.7 billion from $40 billion and its earnings outlook to $0.83 per share from its prior guidance of $0.88 per share. Still, KeyBanc maintained its Overweight rating on the stock and its price target of $180. Overall, analysts see Nvidia’s adjusted quarterly earnings rising 85% from the year-ago period to $0.74 per share and revenue rising roughly 84% to $33.2 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. About 90% of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: Inside Amazon's agonizing attempt to save Alexa with AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-save-alexa-with-ai-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-19T19:04:43Z

Your browser does not support the video element. Amazon's Alexa seems like the perfect product for the generative AI era. Getting this powerful technology to actually work well with the digital assistant is a monumental challenge that's been plagued by gnarly technical problems and repeated delays. Customer-friction concerns, partnership hiccups, compatibility questions, latency problems, and accuracy issues have snarled progress, according to internal Amazon documents and multiple people involved in the project. The Alexa team is under immense pressure to get something out. A decade ago it launched with Echo speakers and became a household name. But that early success fizzled and the business has so far failed to become profitable, leading to drastic cutbacks and layoffs in recent years. Some company insiders consider this AI moment to be a seismic opportunity for Alexa, and potentially the last chance to reignite consumer interest in the voice assistant through the power of large language models. A product of this scale is "unprecedented, and takes time," an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. "It's not as simple as overlaying an LLM onto the Alexa service." One of the main challenges facing the new Alexa relates to how the digital assistant will interact with other companies and services, and who is responsible for customers if their requests, orders, and payments don't go smoothly. In late August, Amazon was working on integrating 8 third-party applications, including Uber and Ticketmaster, into the upcoming AI-powered Alexa to handle various user inquiries. At that time, the goal was to launch the new Alexa around mid-October, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. However, it was still unclear which companies would be responsible for customer support issues, like payment and delivery errors, this document stated. The lack of clarity could cause Amazon to send "frequent" customer contacts to the partner companies. Then, those partners would sometimes redirect the users back to Amazon, the document explained. "This level of support would cause significant customer friction, when some of the orders/purchases are time-sensitive (meal orders or rideshare trips) and purchase mistakes can be expensive (e.g. buy Taylor Swift tickets)," the document said, assigning it a "RED" warning. Snafus like this have caused Amazon to push back the release date, almost on a weekly basis, according to some of the people involved in the project, which has been codenamed "Banyan" or "Remarkable Alexa." BI's sources asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to talk to the press. For example, without more clearly defined responsibilities with third-party partners, Amazon expected further delays in the launch. "Alignment on customer support plans between Product teams and the 3P partners may push this timeline further out if any delays occur," one of the documents warned. The company had once planned for a June launch, but after repeated delays, it told employees late last month that the new Alexa would launch "no earlier" than November 20, one of the documents said. A few of people BI spoke with recently are even talking about the Alexa upgrade rolling out in early 2025, which would miss the key holiday period. Bloomberg earlier reported on a 2025 launch plan. As of late October, Amazon had not settled on an official brand for the updated voice assistant, and instructed employees to simply call it the "new Alexa" until further notice, one of the documents said. To be sure, Alexa has significant long-term potential in the generative AI era — as long as Amazon can iron out problems relatively quickly. Time is of the essence, partly because the existing Alexa business has lost momentum in recent years. According to a recent report from eMarketer, user growth for major voice assistants, including Alexa, has declined significantly in recent years. The sudden rise of ChatGPT has showcased what is possible when powerful AI models are integrated smoothly with popular products that consumers and companies find useful. Some Amazon leaders are bullish about the AI-powered Alexa and a new paid subscription service that could come with it. At least one internal estimate projected a 20% conversion rate for the paid subscription, one of the people said. That would mean that out of every 100 existing Alexa users, roughy 20 would pay for the upgraded offering. Amazon doesn't publicly disclose the number of active Alexa users but has said it has sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices. An internal description of the new Alexa shows Amazon's grand ambitions: "A personalized digital assistant that can handle a wide range of tasks, including drafting and managing personal communications, managing calendars, making reservations, placing orders, shopping, scouting for deals and events, recommending media, managing smart home devices, and answering questions on virtually any topic," one of the documents said. Customers will be able to access the new Alexa "through natural language using voice, text, email, shared photos, and more across all their devices like Echo, Fire TV, mobile phones, and web browsers," it added. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar vision during last month's earnings call, saying the new Alexa will be good at not just answering questions, but also "taking actions." In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said the company's vision for Alexa is to build the world's "best personal assistant." "Generative AI offers a huge opportunity to make Alexa even better for our customers, and we are working hard to enable even more proactive and capable assistance on the over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world. We are excited about what we're building and look forward to delivering it for our customers," the spokesperson said. Still, the project has grappled with several challenges, beyond customer friction and partnership problems. Latency has been a particularly tough problem for the AI Alexa service. In some tests, the new Alexa took about 40 seconds to respond to a simple user inquiry, according to three people familiar with the test results. In contrast, a Google Search query takes milliseconds to respond. To speed up, Amazon considered using a smaller AI model, like Anthropic's Claude Haiku, to power the new Alexa, one of the people said. But that dropped the quality and accuracy of the answers, leaving Amazon in limbo, this person said. In general, smaller language models generate quicker responses than larger models but can be less accurate. Amazon had initially hoped to use a homegrown AI model, one of the people said. Last year, Alexa head scientist Rohit Prasad left the team to create a new Artificial General Intelligence group at Amazon. The stated goal of the new team was to create Amazon's "most expansive" and "most ambitious" large language models. However, this AGI team has not produced notable results so far, which led Amazon to consider Anthropic's main Claude offering as the primary AI model for the new Alexa, this person said. Reuters previously reported that Amazon was going to mainly power Alexa with Claude. Amazon's spokesperson said Alexa uses Amazon Web Services's Bedrock, an AI tool that gives access to multiple language models. "When it comes to machine learning models, we start with those built by Amazon, but we have used, and will continue to use, a variety of different models — including Titan and future Amazon models, as well as those from partners — to build the best experience for customers," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also added a note of caution by highlighting the difficulties of successfully integrating large language models with consumer applications. These models are great for conversational dialogue and content creation, but they can also be "non-deterministic and can hallucinate," the spokesperson added. Getting these models "to reliably act on requests (rather than simply respond) means it has to be able to call real-world APIs reliably and at scale to meet customer expectations, not just in select instances," the spokesperson explained. In late August, Amazon discovered several new risk factors for the AI Alexa service. Only 308 of more than 100,000 existing Alexa "skills," or voice-controlled applications, were compatible with the new Alexa, presenting a "high risk for customers to be frustrated," one of the documents explained. Some older Echo devices would not be able to support the AI-powered Alexa, the document also warned. And there were no plans for expanding the new service to dozens of overseas markets where Alexa is currently available, leaving a large user base out of touch, it also noted. Fortune previously reported some of these risk factors. As of late August, Amazon had 8 "confirmed" partner companies to handle certain tasks for the new Alexa, as BI previously reported. The company hopes to onboard roughly 200 partners by the third year of the new Alexa's launch, one of the documents said. Integrating with some of these companies has already created headaches. One document said that Amazon struggled to develop a consistent troubleshooting process across every partner service. Companies including Uber, Ticketmaster, and OpenTable have deprecated their existing Alexa skills, further disconnecting them from the voice assistant. Amazon's spokesperson said that, as with any product development process, a lot of ideas are discussed and debated, but "they don't necessarily reflect what the experience will be when we roll it out for our customers." Amazon has also anticipated customer complaints, at least in the early launch phase. One internal document from late August stated that the new Alexa was projected to receive 176,000 customer contacts in the first three months of its release. At one point, Amazon considered launching a new automated troubleshooting service for issues related to its devices and digital services, including Alexa, according to one of the internal documents. That was later shelved. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip? Contact the reporter, Eugene Kim, via the encrypted-messaging apps Signal or Telegram (+1-650-942-3061) or email (ekim@businessinsider.com).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steeper losses in late morning trading on Tuesday as fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.5% but off of the lows of the session. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled to back to trade just above the flatline after the index fell below its election breakout level earlier in the trading day. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed declines to gain around 0.3% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Investors are assessing news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean a large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and any attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a nuclear power will be viewed as a joint assault. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 4 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rose to trade above $92,400 a token. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was a tale of two retailers this morning ... Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by 5 cents at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors honed in on continued negative sales growth, despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the "DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand," which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. "Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. "Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence." US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here.

Hat tip to Goldman Sachs's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: This explosive shift in rates—in the wrong direction—is a harbinger of trouble as it is a crucial long-term driver of stock returns. The Oracle of Omaha has shed more than 615 million shares of Apple over the last year, and recently took a notable stake in one of America's most well-known consumer-facing businesses. Warren Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the eighth consecutive quarter in Q3. Berkshire initiated new positions in only two stocks in the last quarter.

Stanley Druckenmiller wowed investors year after year with his winning streak at the helm of Duquesne Capital Management. This top investor closed the fund in 2010 but has since continued investing through the Duquesne Family Office -- and one of his favored stocks in recent times has been artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Earlier this year, this star investor started cutting his Nvidia holding, and in the third quarter, he sold all of his Nvidia shares.

US stocks recovered from steeper losses in late morning trading on Tuesday as fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.5% but off of the lows of the session. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled to back to trade just above the flatline after the index fell below its election breakout level earlier in the trading day. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed declines to gain around 0.3% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Investors are assessing news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean a large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and any attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a nuclear power will be viewed as a joint assault. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 4 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rose to trade above $92,400 a token. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was a tale of two retailers this morning ... Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by 5 cents at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors honed in on continued negative sales growth, despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the "DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand," which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month.

Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. "Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. "Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence." US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here. Economic data: Housing starts (October); Building permits (October) Earnings: Lowe's (LOW), Walmart (WMT), XPeng (XPEV) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Wall Street isn't banking on AI to lift stocks any more Nvidia options primed for $300B post-earnings price swing YF columnist Rick Newman: My Trump trade went bust — with a consolation prize Walmart lifts guidance after earnings and revenue beats Goldman sees S&P 500 hitting 6,500 by end of next year DOJ will push Google to sell Chrome to break search monopoly Super Micro stock surges as company files plan to avoid Nasdaq delisting Walmart (WMT) has worked very diligently behind the scenes the past two years to be a major player online. The retailer has expanded its assortment online and has fine-tuned its "buy online, pick up in store" functionality — among other initiatives. The efforts continue to show up on earnings days. Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever. I am talking to Walmart CFO John David Rainey live at 9:15 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance. Rest assured, we will ask him about these online sales numbers! Hat tip to Goldman Sachs's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: This explosive shift in rates—in the wrong direction—is a harbinger of trouble as it is a crucial long-term driver of stock returns. The Oracle of Omaha has shed more than 615 million shares of Apple over the last year, and recently took a notable stake in one of America's most well-known consumer-facing businesses. Warren Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the eighth consecutive quarter in Q3. Berkshire initiated new positions in only two stocks in the last quarter. Its biggest addition was 1.28 million shares of pizza franchiser Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ). Stanley Druckenmiller wowed investors year after year with his winning streak at the helm of Duquesne Capital Management. This top investor closed the fund in 2010 but has since continued investing through the Duquesne Family Office -- and one of his favored stocks in recent times has been artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Earlier this year, this star investor started cutting his Nvidia holding, and in the third quarter, he sold all of his Nvidia shares. Super Micro Computer met a deadline Monday to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq after delaying prior financial statements. After TLRY hits a 52-week low, we assess whether the current level warrants an opportunity to accumulate shares, hold positions or book profits. Englander's Millennium Management sold close to 4.5 million shares of Palantir and practically tripled its stake in a high-octane electric-vehicle (EV) company in the September-ended quarter. The Oracle of Omaha sets his sights on a prominent brand. MicroStrategy is still holding a lot of Bitcoin. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares are trading higher in premarket Tuesday ahead of the company’s upcoming third-quarter financial results, set for release on Wednesday, November 20, before U.S. markets open. Today, the company’s top peer Chinese EV maker XPeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) reported fiscal third-quarter sales growth of 18.4% year-on-year, to 10.10 billion Chinese Yuan ($1.44 billion), topping the analyst consensus estimate of $1.38 billion.

Title: How Technology Makes The CFO’s Job More About Driving Value

Plus: Finance Departments Plan To Use AI To Be More Efficient—With A Lower Headcount, Trump Stock Rally Slows, The Fight To Be Treasury Secretary, Overtime Rule Expansion Rejected Finance departments are finally getting the technology they need and plan to use it to work efficiently—and will likely need fewer people in the process, according to a new survey from Datarails. Spending on the CFO tech stack is increasing—making them no longer a neglected “Cinderella” department, the study found—with 70% set to invest in AI technology in 2025. More than half say they expect to need fewer people by 2026 when AI use is entrenched. There are plans to use AI throughout the financial sector, although there’s no majority consensus on any one function or task. More than a quarter say financial reporting is the most ripe for AI disruption, but 22% say analytics has that distinction, and 21% say it’s risk assessment. Regardless of how they want to use AI, nearly three in five CFOs at finance, banking and insurance companies say there will be a drop in roles due to AI adoption. A total of 57% of software CFOs are predicting an AI-lowered headcount. But 27% say that it will not impact the number of roles available. Many analysts say that while generative AI can help companies do more, it shouldn’t be replacing actual human employees. But considering the current state of the financial department, this might mean that companies may be able to continue to function at their current levels in the future. The number of accountants is dwindling, with fewer people pursuing accounting college degrees and the CPA career path—the number of bachelor’s degree graduates dipped by 7.8% between 2020-21 and 2021-22, and 6.4% fewer master’s degrees were conferred in the same time period, according to the American Institute of CPAs. And while good financial talent is getting harder to find, AI may be able to fill in some of the gaps. Using more AI may even have the net effect of bringing more people to the financial profession, which Even without AI, technology has led to big changes in CFOs’ jobs—both with what they are expected to do and what they are able to do. I talked to EY Global Finance Transformation Leader Deirdre Ryan about how technology is making CFOs need to be more forward thinking. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. After the votes were tallied and it was clear that Donald Trump would be the next president, the markets took off. But at the end of the last week, investors hit the brakes. Several things happened to cool the rally. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech last Thursday that there are no economic signals that interest rates need to be immediately cut any further. Meanwhile, after Trump announced he would nominate vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, stocks of vaccine makers Novavax, BioNTech and Moderna dropped 5% or more. Tesla, whose stock has been booming in large part because of CEO Elon Musk’s close alliance with Trump, fell into correction mode last week on reports that the president-elect would kill a tax credit for EV purchasers—though it saw a 5.6% rise Monday based on a Bloomberg report that a federal framework for self-driving vehicles was an administration priority. “Trump’s recent unorthodox cabinet picks,” combined with the dollar’s rise to a 12-month high and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed from 4.29% to 4.41% following the election, “is causing investors to re-assess the potential impacts of the incoming Republican government,” wrote Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye in a Friday note to clients. However, analysts are bullish on the markets for the long term. Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley predicted the S&P 500 would hit an all-time high of 6,500 by the end of 2025, based on projected earnings growth and interest rate cuts. The S&P closed at 5,893.62 on Monday. October inflation was up for the first time since March, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released last week, with consumer prices 2.6% higher in October than a year before. Core inflation, excluding more volatile food and energy costs, saw a 3.3% increase. And while these numbers are progress for economists, consumer prices have not fallen as quickly as inflation rates, and people still feel the impact of high inflation. Many people who have analyzed the presidential election have said voters’ personal experiences with inflation were a key driver of Trump’s victory. Brandon Bell/Getty Images While President-elect Donald Trump has quickly been naming his picks to Cabinet-level positions—some controversial and others widely expected—one key nominee has not been announced: Treasury secretary. Reports indicate a three-way race between hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, Wall Street billionaire Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick had been in the running, but reports indicate Trump wants to nominate him for Commerce secretary. The New York Times reported that Trump said he wants someone “big” for the job, and places a high value on wealth and respect from Wall Street. Considering that many of his campaign trail policies centered on the economy—tax cuts, tariffs, ending inflation—the policies enacted by this member of his Cabinet could be among the most important. There’s been no indication when this nominee will be named, though reports indicate the leading candidates are working to showcase their plans—and loyalty—to Trump. getty A federal judge last week rejected President Joe Biden’s rule increasing the maximum employee salary that requires employers to pay an overtime premium. The rule, which took effect in July, increased the salary cap from $35,500 to $44,000. The next increase, which was slated to go into effect next year, would have raised the cap to nearly $59,000. And it also mandated that beginning on July 1, 2027, the maximum salary receiving overtime would automatically increase every three years. The new rule would have expanded overtime pay to 4 million workers. U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan struck it down because it is based on salary, not job duties, which Jordan said also needs to be considered when determining if a salaried employee is eligible for overtime. A similar attempt to increase the maximum salary for receiving overtime issued at the tail end of the Obama administration was struck down in 2017. EY Global Finance Transformation Leader Deirdre Ryan. The CFO’s role has been in flux, transitioning from someone who solely worked with numbers to increasingly becoming a leader in strategy. I talked with Deirdre Ryan, EY Global Finance Transformation leader, about the reasons behind these changes, the new challenges CFOs today face, and what the future likely holds for the position. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What do you think has caused the biggest change to the CFO’s traditional role? Ryan: The advance of technology has allowed them to focus in an area that ultimately better supports the goal of their enterprise. Before, so much time was spent processing transactions. That was the bulk of the effort, not just for the CFO, but the entire finance organization. Most finance organizations, they probably spent 60% to 80% of their time ingesting and processing transactions so that they could produce accurate financial statements. Now with digital technologies, most organizations have leveraged that capability to automate, and it’s allowed them to shift their focus to more value-added activities. We have a point of view that we put together about a year ago. I brought together some of our best global thought leaders. I wanted to very practically say: What is a finance function going to look like three to five years out? There’s just so much change and disruption, and a lot of [CFOs] needed to better understand. What do I need to look like three years from now, five years from now to either gain or maintain a competitive advantage? A lot of that is about automation and leveraging those technologies so that you can pivot your team to really drive value for the enterprise. One of the major challenges is not just learning how to use this technology, but ensuring that the data is clean and can be processed effectively by the system. What are some of the other big challenges CFOs today are facing? The CFO role is evolving, but they’re in this position right now where they have to balance these traditional mandates: Basically we need our CPAs, we need our MBAs, we have to get the numbers right, we have to figure out the “so what” of the data. It’s balancing the traditional mandates and what historically has been expected of a CFO with bold transformation and being able to help her or his organization envision the art of the possible. Historically, when we wanted to drive improvement in finance, typically we would look at an end-to-end process and say: How can we make this more efficient? We could make a little tweak here, put a Band-Aid here, put some bubble gum here. We could drive some efficiency. But now what we’re saying is: Let’s take a step back and think about this differently. Let’s think about the data, as opposed to the process. That’s really going to drive value. Let’s take FP&A. Historically, organizations could have looked at that end-to-end process and said: I’m going to tweak this. I’m going to fix that. But now, given these technologies that we have, you really have to completely reimagine how you’re running that department. It’s such an exciting time, but it takes skill sets that finance professionals didn’t need to lean on so heavily before. That takes a really good understanding of the capabilities of these tools and technologies. Not just reading an article or PowerPoint, but getting your hands dirty and really understanding. It also takes creativity to step back and say: How do I do this in a way that’s effective, efficient, but leveraging these technologies, changing my mindset and opening my mind to the art of the possible? How do you see the CFO's role continuing to evolve in the next five to 10 years? Organizations that have put focus on driving transformation, hopefully they’ll have automated 80% of their transaction processing. CFOs are going to continue to understand and have in-house automation experts. You’re not going to completely eliminate human intervention because you want constant process improvement, but if that’s done, their role is going to continue to evolve towards driving value. Bottom line, we think that the role of a CFO is going to be a data centric function focused on driving value. If you’ve automated capturing data, you have to take advantage of that to drive value. Chip maker AMD announced job cuts last week as it works toward becoming a more dominant player in AI hardware. 4%: Proportion of employees AMD is cutting, which works out to about 1,000 18%: Overall year-over-year increase in AMD’s revenue in its most recent quarterly report.

Title: Wall Street is laser-focused on Nvidia's new Blackwell chip as the AI titan heads into 3rd-quarter earnings
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-earnings-preview-wall-street-forecasts-blackwell-gpu-artificial-intelligence-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-19T17:08:46Z
Full Content:
Nvidia reported its much-anticipated quarterly earnings on Wednesday as Wall Street watched closely for an update on demand for its latest Blackwell AI chips and spending across the industry. Nvidia delivered another strong quarter, saying "the age of AI is in full steam" as sales of its popular semiconductor chips rose. The company reported third-quarter revenue of $35.08 billion — a 94% year-over-year increase — beating the consensus analyst estimate of $33.25 billion. Wall Street analysts were zeroed in on the company's projections for the current quarter and beyond. Nvidia's guidance gives clues to whether Big Tech companies will continue to shovel massive amounts of cash at it as they train their AI models. Nvidia forecast fourth-quarter sales of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, lining up with estimates of $37.1 billion. While the guidance was largely in line with estimates, it failed to surpass the most sky-high of analyst expectations. The chipmaking giant said production for its Blackwell chip — its follow-up to the wildly popular Hopper chip favored by many Big Tech companies — will continue ramping up into fiscal 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Blackwell demand was strong and "coming from a lot of different places." "Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference," he said. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that demand for Blackwell "is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026." The company's profit margin, a closely watched metric, is expected to be impacted by Blackwell production in the short-term but Kress said it could return to the mid-70s in the second half of next year. Asked about Trump's tariff plans and any anticipated impact on Nvidia's China business, Huang said the company is taking things "one quarter at a time." "Whatever the new administration decides, we will, of course, support the administration" and "fully" comply with any new regulations, Huang said. Nvidia's stock fell 2% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results and was trading down more than 1% as the analyst call concluded. The stock is up 194% so far in 2024. That's a wrap on the Q&A portion of the call. Huang recaps the "new industrial revolution" the company says is underway amid the AI boom, and talks about Hopper and Blackwell demand. The CEO mentions AI coworkers and the age of robotics as some of the transformations on the horizon. The newest AI applications consume a huge amount of computing, Huang says, and that's good for Nvidia's business. "There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago," Huang says. "The computing scale of pre-training and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI native startups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising." Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, Huang adds. "The age of robotics is coming," Huang says, and the AI age is already upon us. "Thanks for joining us today," the CEO says in closing. "Catch up next time." Asked about Trump's tariff plans and any impact on Nvidia's China business, Huang dodges a bit on talking specifics, saying the company is taking things "one quarter at a time." "Whatever the new administration decides we will of course support the administration," Huang says. Nvidia will comply "fully" with any regulation that comes along with Trump's return to the White House while also continuing to compete in the marketplace, he adds. Kress says the ability to sell Nvidia's networking with many of its systems that the company is doing in its data centers continues to do "quite well." "So this quarter is just a slight dip down, and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing," CFO Kress says. "We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking, but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to," she adds. Google's Notebook LM, which started out as an experiment, allows users to drop in links, information, and files. It will generate a podcast hosted by two AI hosts, as well as study guides and briefing docs.Huang says NotebookLM is one of his favorite applications. "I use the living daylights out of it," Huang says, adding that he puts every PDF and archive into it. He says the goal is to train models so that people use it. At the same time, companies are looking to build out their Blackwell systems, the CFO says. It's possible for Hopper to grow from Q3 to Q4, Kress says, but "we'll see." Blackwell will put pressure on profit margins next quarter, but Kress says it may recover as the ramp-up continues next year. "I think it is a reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes." Asked if Nvidia's gross margins could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year, Kress says "Yes." The first shift is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that runs off GPUs. "That fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread," Huang says, adding that "there are no companies" that won't do machine learning. The second shift is that the systems are creating AI, he says. "When we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories," Huang adds. The CEO says he expects the modernization of this new industry to go on for several years. In discussing supply and demand, Huang says the company is at the beginning of a Gen AI revolution and the new generation of foundation models that can reason, such as OpenAI's o1 model. Huang names physical AI as a "really exciting" area. He defined it as AI "that now understands the structure of the physical world." Huang is asked a tough question that references past production challenges for Blackwell and a recent report about heating issue concerns. An analyst asks what he would say to investors who are concerned about Nvidia's ability to execute the roadmap Huang previously presented. In his response, Huang reiterates that Blackwell production is in full steam. Nvidia will deliver more Blackwells this quarter than previously estimated, the CEO says, and demand exceeds supply as expected. Our execution is "going well," he adds. Huang says the engineering required to get each system online in customers' data centers is complicated. "We're very good at it, but still, there's still a lot of a lot of engineering that happens at this point." Huang says Blackwell demand is "coming from a lot of different places." In a question about whether demand for Blackwell is greater since clusters have yet to benefit from it, the CEO said demand is coming from various areas: Pre-training scaling, post-training scaling, and inference time scaling. Huang says Nvidia is especially seeing "inference demand go up" CEO Jensen Huang fields the first question. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to decline sequentially. The CFO says the decline is due to supply constraints. She adds that Nvidia is currently focusing on on "ramping to strong demand." As Blackwell ramps up, Kress says margins are expected to be in the low 70's, and "when fully ramped," she expects margins in the mid-70's. Accenture has trained 30,000 consultants on Nvidia's product stack. Kress highlighted one case in which the steps required for a marketing campaign decreased 35% with AI. The CFO mentions Deloitte as well. Combined the two have more than 1 million employees. Kress says Nvidia data center revenue in China "grew significantly due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products." As Kress continues with her prepared remarks, Nvidia stock was trading down around half a percent in after-hours trading. Nvidia had some early production issues that it had to work through. Nvidia's CFO says Blackwell is in "full production" after making changes. Nvidia shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first engineering samples. She says demand for the chip "is staggering," and the company is "racing to scale supply" to meet the demand. Kress also mentions data center revenue hitting a new quarterly record of $30.8 billion. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which opens with some prepared remarks about the company's performance over the third quarter. The execs will then field questions from Wall Street analysts. Emarketer technology analyst Jacob Bourne tells BI that Nvidia continues to show its dominance in AI chip demand, but "critical questions" remain around Blackwell's production and customer concentration. Bourne says Nvidia's expansion into areas including digital twins and autonomous vehicles "shows promising diversification" but also strong dependance on certain customers. "Despite Nvidia's technological leadership through CUDA and its first-mover advantage in AI infrastructure, there's little room for execution missteps in 2025," Bourne says. "Particularly given uncertainties around Blackwell's rollout and increasing competition from both AMD and key customers' in-house chip development efforts." 3rd quarter Revenue: $35.08 billion, +94% y/y, estimate $33.25 billion 4th quarter guidance Revenue: $37.5 billion, plus/minus 2%, estimate $37.1B Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock was down 2% heading into its third-quarter earnings report. The intra-day decline was more than triple the Nasdaq's 0.6% decline, and far outpaced the S&P 500's 0.4% dip. The options market implies an 8% swing in Nvidia stock in either direction after it reports its earnings results later today. If realized, the swing would imply a $300 billion gain or loss in market value for the AI giant. Nvidia has a market valuation of about $3.53 trillion as of Wednesday afternoon. Long-time Nvidia bull Dan Ives of Wedbush expects Nvidia to deliver the goods when it reports earnings on Wednesday. "We expect another drop the mic performance from Nvidia tomorrow after the bell as right now Jensen & Co. are the only game in town with $1 trillion+ of AI Cap-Ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia's GPUs the new oil and gold in this world," Ives said in a Tuesday note. Ives said he expects Nvidia to beat both revenue and guidance estimates by $2 billion. "Blackwell production and demand appear robust and we expect very bullish commentary from Jensen on the conference call which will be a focus of the Street that sends the bears back into their caves and hibernation mode," Ives said. Ives added that he is encouraged by the "cloud numbers and AI data points" offered by cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet during their recent earnings calls. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani said in a recent note that he expects Nvidia's profit margins to remain well above the 70% level, which is high for a hardware manufacturer. "Gross margin is likely to decline as much as expected in 4Q yet remain comfortably above 73%," Sobhani said. "Nvidia is likely to solidly exceed 3Q revenue consensus more than it did in the past two quarters and the company will likely raise 4Q guidance, driven by greater adoption of its Hopper family, even as hyperscaler customers await the Blackwell ramp-up in 2025," Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani said in a recent note. Sobhani highlighted that Blackwell delay concerns were likely solved in the third-quarter, setting up the expectation that shipments "to key customers" will begin in the fourth-quarter. "Increased capex guidance from hyperscalers has further boosted confidence in near-term sales. We expect small volume shipments of Blackwell in fiscal 4Q, reaching full speed in 1Q26, though supply remains constrained," Sobhani said. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they're hyper-focused on Nvidia's guidance for the fourth quarter, which they expect should confirm their bullish thesis on the stock. They added that they expect the company's "break out" quarter to be the first quarter of 2025 as the Blackwell product launch ramps up. Goldman Sachs expects Nvidia to deliver $34.3 billion in revenue for the third quarter, with adjusted earnings per share at $0.79, which is above consensus estimates. "We expect strong demand for Nvidia's Hopper-based GPUs (i.e. H100 and particularly the H200) and Spectrum-X (i.e. Ethernet-based Networking product) to drive strong double-digit (%) Data Center revenue growth," Goldman Sachs said. The strong expected earnings results, combined with Nvidia's current valuation, suggest to Goldman that the stock should perform well going forward. Goldman Sachs rates Nvidia at "Buy" with a $150 price target. According to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, investors should manage expectations around guidance for Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell launch. "We caution investors to temper expectations for Blackwell inclusion for the Jan-Q outlook (we conservatively look for $3B-$5B in sales), limiting upside to consensus views in the near term as NVDA likely takes a somewhat conservative stance to provide itself with a buffer," Zino said in a recent note. Still, Zino expects Blackwell chips will be sold out for much of 2025. "We expect Blackwell to be supply constrained through CY 25, given heightened demand from hyperscalers to support next-generation data centers. In addition to Blackwell expectations/performance concerns that will likely dominate NVDA's Q&A session on the call, we expect investors to dissect any comments on tariffs/Sovereign AI after Trump's victory," Zino said. CFRA Research rates Nvidia at "Buy" with a $160 price target. 3rd quarter Revenue estimate: $33.25 billion 4th quarter Source: Bloomberg Jump to

Title: YieldMax ETFs: What They Are And Are They Safe

getty The rapid increase in interest in the stock market since the start of the pandemic has some important by-products. One of those is the rocketing appeal in using options as part of an overall investing strategy. Options are not new, nor are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have been around for more than 30 years. However, the combination of the ETF product structure, with options driving the performance from within, is entering a golden era of sorts. Enter YieldMax ETFs, a recently-launched product line, launched through a collaboration between Tidal Investments (the advisor) and ZEGA Financial (the sub-advisor). The product line now includes more than 30 funds, just two years after the initial launch of a Tesla-based ETF (YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy (TSLY)) on November 22, 2022. At the core of these funds is the idea of taking the price volatility of an underlying stock or set of stocks, and using a strategy known as “credit call spreads” to convert that volatility into a high level of income, modest participation in price upside, and some degree of downside protection. YieldMax ETFs are typically a combination of three investments. First is a backing of the options strategy using U.S. Treasury Bills, which frequently make up more than 80% of the value of the ETF each month, when expiring options are replaced with newer options contracts. The other two investments are a pair of options. Instead of buying the stock outright, as some of its peers do, YieldMax buys call options to act as a surrogate for owning the stock. These are “out of the money” call options, which means that the fund can benefit from some of the future price appreciation, if any, in the target stock. The other option is the sale of a call option, which has a strike price between 0% and 15% of the current stock price. That means that the upside in the stock is limited, but in exchange for giving up that potential return, the shareholder receives a handsome income payout each month. Depending on the ETF and market conditions, Yield Max ETFs will also use other option strategies, such as selling put options. These obligate the holder of the option to buy the underlying stock at a future price that is typically below the price of the stock when the put option is sold. In other words, the investor is receiving cash now in exchange for the risk of being forced to buy the stock later.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. As noted above, the underlying assets are call options (bought and sold) and T-bills. The stock itself is not owned, and does not have to be for the strategy to work. The calls obligate the holder to produce the shares if “called” upon. And the sale of the other call position brings in the income. Income is generated from the sale of the call options, since the investor is sacrificing upside to be paid now. That income and any other cash flow resulting from the T-bills or other assets is delivered to shareholders in a monthly dividend. Expense ratios for these ETFs are typically 0.99% of assets, which gets them just under the 1.00% rate that industry participants often screen for in considering candidates to be sufficiently cost-efficient. But frankly, YieldMax ETFs are a different breed altogether, given their tremendous income-producing potential. The product line also includes several applications of the strategy to more than a single stock, and those have expense ratios slightly above 1.00%. This fairly new line of ETFs has attracted lots of attention during its first two years of existence. That is due to a combination of the popularity of the Magnificent 7 stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla and Meta, and the increased demand for income from an ever-growing number of Baby Boomers, who are retiring or shifting from growth toward income in their investment objectives. These ETFs typically yield above their peers, since they aim to spin off option income from single stocks, which are more volatile than indexes (baskets of stocks). There are some YieldMax funds that allocate among stocks, but the most popular so far have been the ones aimed at a single stock. While those stocks can present big risk from lack of diversification, the use of T-bills and options acts as a potential risk modifier. The ETF package is a nice match for the combination of call options known as a call spread. While the elements of these portfolios can be created and managed by investors on their own, there are variables each month based on how volatile the stocks involved and the market happen to be. Monthly income from these ETFs is more in sync with the pace at which investors prefer to receive portfolio cash flow if they are using that money to live on.

So of course there is risk and volatility in the price of these securities. T-bills are considered to be very safe investments, and options are heavily-regulated and in the case of the contracts used by YieldMax, quite liquid. That said, if the fund company’s success reaches the point where they need to resort to private placement options contracts, as has been the case with other ETF producers, that could introduce credit risk. Interest rates impact everything, as does market volatility. The key impact here is the extent to which rates hurt the prices of the underlying stocks, as well as the income available from that large T-bill allocation. Interest rates also may have an impact on the premiums available to bring in as income via the call option sales that drive these products. YieldMax is not a new concept, but it does take the option-driven approach to another level. By applying call spread investing and trading to single stocks, investors who are income-oriented but would like to get a piece of the potential return from lower yield and no yield stocks, can look at YieldMax ETFs as a potential investment. Dividend investing is changing rapidly. Stocks do not yield as much as they used to, thanks in part to rising stock prices and also because company management increasingly back stock instead of using their excess cash flow for dividends. And, short-term bond rates are much higher than a few years ago. That makes YieldMax ETFs an intriguing investment for those who want to complement their traditional approach to income investing. It should come as no surprise that the most popular YieldMax ETFs in terms of assets are those that target single stocks that are very popular. Those include NVDY (YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy), which applies the YieldMax call spread methodology to Nvidia; MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy), which points to MicroStrategy, CONY (YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy), which is based on Coinbase stock; and TSLY, in which Tesla is the underlying stock. The expense ratio and other fees, though modest for a product line as innovative as this one, is still a consideration for investors. When the yield is flowing and the stocks are holding up, that roughly 1% cost is lost in the profits and income. But in a sustained rough stock market, all costs of investing should get more scrutiny. Start with the idea that when investing, nothing is totally “safe.” But working up from there, the T-bills, options (which commit less money to the stock’s future price movement than buying shares outright) and the oversight of the firms involved here provide a competitive environment for these new ETFs to succeed. The best thing investors can do in considering YieldMax ETFs is to understand the different parts of the fund’s asset allocation, how they work separately and together. Only then can someone determine to what extent, if any, the combination of features, benefits and risks fits for them. Investors seeking to access the underlying stocks and stock baskets these ETFs aim to track, but do with higher expected income, are the most likely candidates to give YieldMax funds a good look. Personally, I own several of them, as a complement to my own dividend stock and income ETF portfolio. That said, I also take the additional step of using hedging mechanisms to buffer my portfolio against severe stock price weakness or other risks cited above. YieldMax ETFs are popular for many good reasons. But with any investment, it is a personal choice, and research and true understanding of what one is buying is the best way to meet your own expectations without risking disappointment. A fund listed on the public market that combines T-bills and options to produce income and upside potential from stocks and stock baskets, many of which do not have high dividend yields. Yes. Tidal investments is involved in many aspects of the ETF business, including product creation, distribution and advisory. YieldMax is one of many ETFs they play a prominent role in creating, marketing and managing. Disclosure: I own several YieldMax funds.

Another Nvidia (NVDA-3.10%) customer is ready to launch the chipmaker’s highly-anticipated new artificial intelligence platform. Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%) chief executive Satya Nadella announced the first cloud private preview of Nvidia’s Blackwell AI infrastructure on its cloud computing platform, Azure, during the company’s developers’ conference on Tuesday. The Azure ND GB200 V6 VM series is based on the Nvidia Blackwell platform. “Blackwell is pretty amazing. It’s got this 72 GPUs on a single NVLink domain, and then you combine it with InfiniBand on the backend,” Nadella said during his keynote at Microsoft Ignite. “These racks are optimized for the most cutting-edge training workloads and inference workloads.” New servers from Microsoft will also be equipped with its new in-house security chip, Azure Integrated HSM, or hardware security module, that uses encryption and signing keys for protection. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s customers reportedly have been worried about delays for the Blackwell AI platform. The chipmaker repeatedly has asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The server racks combine 72 of the AI chips in hopes that larger AI models can be trained faster with more GPUs, or graphics processing units. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reported, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. Nvidia previously faced production and shipping delays for Blackwell due to a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” Microsoft also introduced new purpose-built AI agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, including an interpreter agent that allows for real-time interpretation in up to nine languages in Microsoft Teams meetings, which will launch in preview early next year. It also rolled out a project manager agent, now in preview, that can automatically create plans and oversee projects. In addition, the tech giant launched the autonomous AI agent capabilities that it announced in October. Customers can build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio that can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf,” Microsoft said.

Title: Super Micro Computer stock soars 30% as it avoids getting booted off the Nasdaq

Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI+8.26%) surged more than 30% on Tuesday morning after the AI hardware company successfully maintained its Nasdaq (NDAQ+0.37%) listing by hiring a new auditor. The move comes several weeks after the server company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, following months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. “We are pleased to welcome BDO as Supermicro’s independent auditor,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement. Moreover, the company submitted a detailed compliance plan to the Nasdaq, outlining its efforts to meet the exchange’s requirements and avoid delisting. The San Jose-based company expressed its ability to meet key regulatory deadlines, stating that it expects to finalize its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, as well as its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2024. The company aims to bring its periodic filings up to date within the discretionary period allowed by Nasdaq staff. The statement has alleviated fears about the tech giant’s potential removal from the Nasdaq, putting an end to the uncertainty surrounding its listing. The news sparked a relief rally among investors, boosting confidence in the company’s ability to navigate regulatory hurdles. Super Micro’s stock is currently trading at $27, representing a steep decline of 78% from its March peak of $123. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. The stock has thrived for much of this year and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.26%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms.

Title: Goldman Sachs sees S&P 500 hitting 6,500 in 2025 amid 'narrowing' big tech outperformance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Another Wall Street strategist sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining by a double-digit percentage over the next year. On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. The call falls in line with the 6,500 projection Morgan Stanley made the day prior and just shy of BMO Capital Markets' 2025 year-end target of 6,700. "In our baseline macro outlook, the economy and earnings continue to grow and bond yields remain around current levels," Kostin wrote. "But event risk remains high heading into 2025, including from the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential risk from even higher bond yields." Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. "The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns," Kostin wrote. "Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493."' Within this call for a broadening of stock market performance within the S&P 500, Goldman also argues that the stocks leading the artificial intelligence trade may begin to shift. Goldman believes gains will shift from a group it has dubbed AI "infrastructure," which includes companies on the ground floor of AI like Nvidia (NVDA), to a group of companies that will have "enabled revenues" from AI, meaning those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. The largest companies by market cap in Goldman's enabled revenues basket are Meta and Apple. In the outlook named after Donald Trump's "Art of the Deal," Kostin recommends owning stocks that could be exposed to a pickup in M&A under the president-elect's administration as well as companies who benefit from a pickup in activity among small and medium-size businesses. Kostin cited a pickup in the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) small business optimism index back in November 2016 when Trump was first elected. Goldman identified a list of 60 companies with at least 50% of revenues tied to small businesses. Large companies in that cohort include Meta, Deere & Company (DE), and Waste Management (WM). "It was truly a reflection of 'animal spirits' coming to life and this behavior is likely to be repeated now that Donald Trump has been elected to serve as the 47th President from January 2025 to January 2029," Kostin wrote. "The valuation of [small business]-exposed stocks reflects the current depressed level of small business sentiment. We expect an improving small business operating environment will boost the sentiment and spending of [small businesses] in 2025 and lift the earnings and valuation of stocks with revenues tied to that spending."

Title: Huawei's advanced chips are taking a hit from U.S. sanctions

Time Published: 2024-11-19T13:35:00Z

China’s answer to being banned from Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.10%) artificial intelligence chips is reportedly being stalled by U.S. trade restrictions. Huawei’s next two Ascend processors are being designed with the 7-nanometer process that has existed for years, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The hampered efforts are reportedly due U.S.-led export controls that don’t allow Huawei’s Chinese chipmaking partners to get extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from the Netherlands-based ASML (ASML-0.23%). The snag means Huawei’s technology for its advanced chips will be years behind until at least 2026, and advanced processors for its Mate 60 smartphones will also be held back, people told Bloomberg. For comparison, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.35%), the manufacturing partner to Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+0.48%), has said it expects volume production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025 — three generations ahead of Huawei. To add to the pain, Huawei’s main Chinese chipmaking partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., is reportedly having issues producing steady yields — or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — of 7-nanometer chips. One person told Bloomberg that Huawei may not have enough chips for AI and smartphones in the next few years. Meanwhile, TSMC reportedly told its Chinese customers earlier this month that it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7 nanometer process. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the Financial Times reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker’s new rules come as it faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from the sanctioned Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves

Failures We’ve documented in detail how the whole AT&T–>Time Warner–>Warner Brothers Discovery merger process has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands. What was supposed to be a gambit by these companies to dominate streaming TV, wound up being a very expensive act of seppuku by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths. With streaming subscription growth saturated, the market has been forced to get “creative” in order to feed Wall Street its expected quarterly returns. That has meant sagging quality control for streaming services like Max, and a steady parade of price hikes that generally haven’t been worth it. Speaking on the company’s recent conference call, Time Warner Discovery executives are making it clear that all manner of new restrictions and price hikes are on the way, just in case you were looking forward to more of that sort of thing. Among them will be a crackdown on the diabolical “password sharing” the industry used to view as helpful free advertising: “During the earnings call for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for its fiscal Q3 2024, which ended on September 30, WBD signaled that it’s gearing up to roll out its next strategy for growing streaming revenue—charging subscribers extra for sharing passwords—over the next few months. This will start with “very soft messaging” toward Max users before the crackdown intensifies in 2025 and 2026, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said. Wiedenfels admitted that on their own, password crackdowns are “a form of price rises.” Executives say they’re also exploring, like Amazon, steadily increasing the number of ads paying customers see. And they will, of course, just be rising prices steadily until they see a mass exodus of subscribers: “WBD also hinted at potential price hikes for Max today. During the earnings call, JB Perrette, WBD’s CEO and president of global streaming and games, noted that although Max has raised US subscription prices twice in the past two years, WBD believes it can get away with even higher prices: “We think the premium nature of our product in particular lends us to be – to have a fair amount of room to continue to push price.” Except the “premium nature” of the product doesn’t exist anymore. Any cachet enjoyed from the HBO brand has largely been killed off thanks to executives’ prioritization of lower-quality reality TV dreck as they pursue lowest common denominator engagement bait at scale. There’s still occasionally good art on Max; but the heyday of HBO as a prestige production empire is long, long dead. Meanwhile the kind of things that customers actually want (lower prices, better quality, better customer service) cost money and erode those sweet quarterly returns. The kinds of things customers and labor don’t want (price hikes, sagging quality, layoffs, weird new restrictions on access) are where the current growth and revenue boosting resides. So guess what you’re going to get. It’s not enough for a publicly traded company to provide an affordable product that people really like. That doesn’t achieve exponential, impossible growth. To get that (or the illusion of that) requires a certain aggressive creativity. And if streaming can’t obtain it via annoying price hikes and restrictions, as Time Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav has made clear, they’ll achieve it with pointless new harmful mergers under Trump. These folks insist they’re just engaging in the cold calculus of cost efficiency, but you’ll notice that excessive and unwarranted executive compensation somehow always avoids scrutiny. Again, I suspect what’s next for the industry is a whole bunch more consolidation and mergers to try and minimize any serious price competition and to nab tax breaks. From there I suspect you’ll start seeing a greater fixation on finding creative new ways to “reduce churn,” which will likely (now that the FTC will be lobotomized under Trump) include complicated new tricks to make cancelling services more difficult. When customers inevitably revolt and flock back to piracy (which is already starting to happen), execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!), and the innovation and disruption cycle will repeat itself all over again. Filed Under: cable, competition, consolidation, disruption, mergers, streaming, time warner discovery, tv, video Companies: warner bros. discovery I share my streaming stuff with my partner. Thing is, because of my stepdaughter education I live in 2 different addresses. Since I’d have to pay added fees for more than one service I decided a vpn was the least expensive way to deal with the issue for now. Customer service was utterly useless to deal with this on all of them. I already canceled Netflix because of the price hikes and because the content isn’t worth it and from the looks of it more services are joining it soon. I’m already planning some Plex setup for the kid because we all know where this shit is going to. And a bottle of rum. You have been watching too many videos that are rated “Arrr!” Hadn’t watched Amazon Prime in a while and when I did it literally started with 6 ads. Now I think of it like warming up the air fryer. Hit watch and know I’ve got 5 minutes to do something else. The “premium nature” of the product seems to only be the price. By this logic, the more customers pay, the more it’s worth. And since every service raise their price, the more the market worth. But how to explain to customers that they need to pay to please shareholders they don’t even know? Well, just ask Trump to declare that cancelling a subscription is illegal. TV Industry: “We will merge until your options are content at an infinite price or no content.” I’m wondering why the shareholders don’t sue the WBD Board of Directors over Zaslav’s absurd compensation, considering the stock’s horrible performance. None of the streaming services are “premium” enough to keep me interested for more than a month or two out of every 12 so that’s all I give them. Put them all together, and it’s not even 12 months so sometimes I just watch Hoopla and Kanopy and read a book. execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!) Woke decline wasn’t evident until this past year or late 2023 at earliest. The spastic woke energy that erupted after George Floyd’s death was purposefully directed into the institutions over the next 24 months and then plateaued late 2023 to early 2024 and then started on a slight downward gradient until 10/7. I don’t think Trump will calm things down. But this time I think there are people in his orbit who ‘get it’ and will be very capable and aggressive in terms of how they use the bureaucracy and administrative law. Please define “woke” in objective terms within the context in which you’re using it. Is it too “woke” to provide healthcare to pregnant women who experience difficulties during child gestation? Why is it that so many maga men want to see all women suffer and die needlessly? Is it “woke” to be offended by such hateful actions? A complete misunderstanding. Which seems to be purposeful here. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” “Your body, my choice” will be met with “Your crotch, my boot” Get back to me when the man can say abort, I don’t want to support that child. “I don’t want to support that child.” Well then, keep it in your pants. Is this too difficult for you? Keep your legs closed. Is that too difficult for you? A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy. And yes, historically, considering the number of unplanned pregnancies, it is difficult for some people to abstain. “Try not getting a cold your entire life!” Thanks, doctor dude! A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy Nor is a consenting man consenting to financial burden Then consenting man should consent to wearing a rubber, fool. That’s not a matter of consent, but a matter of law. Genetic donors are typically considered legally required to provide support of some kind. I don’t consent to having to mow my lawn, but the city will fine me if I don’t. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” The only reason you give a shit about women’s sports is so you can exclude a mere handful of people from it. You wouldn’t give a shit otherwise. Hell, you don’t even seem to give a shit about the idea of “biological women” playing in men’s sports⁠—and that’s because I’ve never seen anyone who rails against trans women do the same schtick for trans men. It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it. Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL…There is a reason they don’t. Maybe one day you will figure it out. Figure what out? What does sports have to do with women’s healthcare? Are you addicted to adderall like your hero Donald? Don’t know what it is. But since you are accusing… Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL… There is a reason they don’t. It’s because men needlessly feel ashamed when outperformed by women in any sport. Exactly! Hence the wnba What is a woman? It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it You make it sound so, binary Adjective; 1) anything I don’t like. 2) anything for the benefit of anyone who isn’t me (see 1). by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths You make it sound like pointless mergers are a bad thing. The executives keep getting over-compensated, so they’re happy. Who gives a fuck that everyone else is unhappy. When customers inevitably revolt Would be nice if we could have that revolt now, and skip this whole cycle of enshittifying. Instead of increasing the subscription count after the password crackdown, for once. Welcome to the USAnian Consumer’s Front. In the old days, TV programs were free to the viewer because networks ran ads. We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. Then we got tired of ads and decided to pay networks to show up content without ads, which led to cable channels such HBO, Showtime, and so on. Then it let to services like Netflix, which had movies and TV shows in one place. But now we have to pay for content AND watch commercials? AND the length of the commercials is as long as, or LONGER THAN, networks TV?? How long will it take until people stop putting up with it? Do the executives not realize that pay services are not essential and it’s only a matter of time before people think the service isn’t worth the money? “Why do people put up with it? ” I don’t It’s all lies anyway We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. No; it was accepted because there was no other choice. If you went to a movie theater, you’d see ads (some called “trailers” because they used to run after the movie, till the advertisers realized everyone was leaving without watching them; and since 1990 or so, there are also just regular paid ads). Books would often have ads for other books by the same author or publisher. Magazines and newspapers were full of advertising, and also abused their subscribers by selling their data to postal and telephone spammers. TV shows were only distributed on advertising-supported networks, whether or not you were paying a cable provider for them, and were never sold; same for radio shows. When networks like HBO and Showtime came around, a small number of people were willing to pay because there were shows they couldn’t get elsewhere; being ad-free was mostly a bonus. Some of the “premium” networks were themselves initially “bonuses” (or forced subscriptions, depending on your point of view) included with cable TV. Similarly for streaming services: they were sold on the basis of being convenient (lots of stuff to watch, no schedules), not being ad-free; and some, notably Amazon, were bundled with unrelated subscriptions. Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves But morale hasn’t got a chance of improving until streaming services are no longer enshittified, so I guess streaming TV is going to die.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Mad Money Episode: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's "easy" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some "serious gains." "I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense." Cramer said banks do not "care" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation. "I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds."

For this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130 Commenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said: “I am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don’t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.” Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Lifting 42% YTD What Next For Bank Of America?

Bank of America at the heart of Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, ... [+] United Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) Bank of America’s stock (NYSE: BAC) has gained about 42% year-to-date, compared to the 25% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. Bank of America’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 54% YTD. Overall, at its current price of $46 per share, BAC is trading around the Trefis’ estimate for Bank of America’s valuation. Some of the stock’s recent gains come off the back of the U.S. election, which saw the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, lending activity, and potentially lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts and this could also help the bottom lines of banks like Bank of America. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and are on track to win the House of Representatives as well, and this could also be seen as a positive for the banking sector at large. The increase in BAC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -24% in 2022, and 5% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BAC face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Let’s take a look at the company’s recent performance and outlook to find out. Bank of America outperformed the street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024, with total revenues coming in at $25.3 billion roughly flat compared to last year as the company’s gains in trading revenues, asset management, and investment banking fees were offset by a decline in net interest income. In addition, net profits declined 12% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, on account of higher provisions for loan losses. Net interest income has been impacted by rising rates, which result in higher payments on deposits while potentially deterring borrowing and loan growth as financing becomes more expensive for clients. However, the company has seen stronger activity in its advisory and trading businesses. While the Fixed-income trading revenue rose 8% year-over-year during the last quarter, led by stronger currencies and interest rate-related activity, Equities trading jumped 18% on account of higher cash and derivative volumes. BofA’s wealth and investment management revenue also rose 8% year-over-year to $5.8 billion driven by rising market valuations and client flows. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. The sequential growth in NII during Q3 also indicates that a potential turnaround is taking hold. Additionally, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase.

Title: Could Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Grow 10x Over the Next 3 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. The new president of the United States is set to take office in January 2025, and investors are concerned about how the new policies will impact big tech. On November 14, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations from big tech as the new presidency takes over the White House. Krishna shares that he expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with certain "guardrails." He adds that the business community is particularly excited and expects strong tailwinds to the US economy as we enter 2025. In the same interview, William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, appeared to discuss the potential future of big tech under the new presidency and how the new policies could impact companies, particularly those trading in China. Kerwin emphasizes that a lot is yet to unfold but the most crucial element is tariffs. With a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports, companies reliant on the region will face severe headwinds and may have to seek trade relationships with other regions like India and Southeast Asia. However, he does add that high exposure to China does not necessarily equate to "high investment risk." READ ALSO 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now and 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Speaking of mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, Kerwin is rather optimistic. He expects more merger and acquisition deals to come through over the next four years. In addition to that, he expresses that anti-trust regulations are less likely to be focused on a specific company or a product, and more on the platforms and their respective use cases offered by big tech. Kerwin also adds that he does not expect significant breakups but foresees regulations to be enforced that "erode" the competitive advantages the big tech companies enjoy at the moment. Kerwin believes that companies well exposed to artificial intelligence are currently overvalued. However, he reiterates that this "does not mean" that there are not any opportunities within the sector. He also shares a couple of names in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors that are well-positioned at the moment. He suggests that while these sectors are pressed over cyclicality worries and the fear of AI reaching maturity, some companies hold promise and are valuable. Since investors are excited to see the business opportunities coming over the next four years, there are certain stocks, especially in the realm of technology, most likely to gain significant momentum. That said, let's take a look at the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 8 based on their upside potential, as of November 18, 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Analyst Upside as of November 18, 2024: 29% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks that could 10x over the next three years. The semiconductor company makes chips for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. TSM attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its presence across the world. The company recently formed a joint venture with major partners in Germany and expanded its partnership with Amkor to facilitate advanced packaging in Arizona, fueling the semiconductor ecosystem in the region. In addition to that, the company expects to spend $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, allocated to advanced process technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and testing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) expects revenue from AI chips to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall TSM ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Novo Nordisk said Monday it has launched its popular obesity drug Wegovy in China, the world’s second-largest pharmaceuticals market where it estimates more than 180 million people live with obesity. The move intensifies the competition with Eli Lilly, which secured approval for its weight-loss drug in China in July but has yet to launch it. Both companies are ramping up production to capitalize on a weight-loss market projected by analysts to exceed $150 billion by the beginning of the next decade. A spokesperson for the Danish drugmaker confirmed the news to Reuters after it was first reported by China-based financial media outlet Yicai. Related article Your employer may start covering weight-loss drugs soon The list price of Wegovy in the United States is about $1,349 for a month’s supply. The Novo spokesperson did not comment on the price in China. Novo gained approval for Wegovy in China in June and will initially target Chinese patients willing to pay out-of-pocket for the weekly injectable drug. Novo (NVO) launched Wegovy in the US in 2021. Strong sales there and in the 15 other countries where Wegovy has since launched have propelled Novo’s shares to record highs. The company has a market capitalization of about $449 billion. Wegovy will not be reimbursed by China’s national healthcare insurance, which provides basic coverage for most of the country’s 1.4 billion people. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Delta will lay out plans for its continued carrier dominance at Investor Day

Time Published: 2024-11-18T18:15:00Z

Delta Air Lines (DAL-0.28%) is having a pretty good year so far. Its stock has climbed 57% since January 1, more than double the gains of the S&P 500. And despite the CrowdStrike (CRWD+2.52%) software outage that introduced far more chaos into its operations than its industry peers — to the tune of $500 million in losses — the carrier is still pulling in profits. Now Delta wants to let its current and prospective shareholders know that it expects to have a pretty good 2025 as well. It’s not dealing with severe financial woes like Spirit Airlines. It’s not coming out the other end of a nasty proxy battle like Southwest Airlines. And it’s not battling to regain the trust of key constituencies like American Airlines. So its upcoming Investor Day should prove to be a pretty low-key affair. Maintaining a comfortable cruising altitude is sometimes easier said than done; investors will be looking to see if Delta can stay on course. Next year marks the company’s 100th anniversary — with a rockstar launch to come in Las Vegas — and it looks like Delta will get to have its birthday cake and eat it, too. Delta is the largest airline in America by market share according the Department of Transportation, edging out the likes of fellow majors Southwest and American Airlines (AAL+0.46%). The ratings agency Fitch restored Delta’s investment-grade credit rating this July after cutting it to junk during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic. When it did so, it specifically cited Delta’s best-in-class market share as part of its rationale. “Delta’s investment grade rating is supported by its position as a leading network airline in the consolidated U.S. market,” the agency said. “Dominant positions in key hubs and a high level of network utility provide a competitive advantage over smaller airlines.” When Delta presented its most recent earnings report in October, one of the biggest headlines coming out of the release was a focus on the potential for election-week flying jitters to ding what is expected to be an otherwise robust fourth quarter. With Delta’s top-flight status secured, its next step is ensuring that it stays on top. Though there has been some focus on its efforts to swoop down to poach customers from low-fare airlines, its higher-profile customer-development schemes are trained on squeezing more money out of first- and business-class flyers who desire luxurious experiences, which just so happen to be much more profitable to provide. Per airline analyst Tom Fitzgerald at TD Cowen (TD+0.05%): We expect customer demographics to be a focus, both the company’s efforts around cultivating long-term relationships with clients as their desired cabin section progresses upward along their careers, as well as the opportunity around baby boomers and older members of Gen X who are able to fund premium travel out of robust nest eggs. After all, enormous and exclusive airport lounges are not a loss-leader proposition. During that last earnings call, analysts kept asking Delta’s executives if they could shed some light on the carrier’s long-term plans. The c-suite was cagey with specifics, but one theme of the executives’ comments was that everything seemed to be firing on all cylinders and would continue to do so. CEO Ed Bastian said that his company’s inertial sturdiness was one of its most prized assets. “It’s really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that’s moving at a pretty good speed … and so, we’ll continue on the pace we’re on,” he said. “We’re not going to change course. If anything, we’re just going to continue to accelerate.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Government-funded insurance plans are more likely to cover weight-loss drugs than private plans
URL: https://qz.com/medicaid-wegovy-insurance-coverage-1851701911
Time Published: 2024-11-18T17:16:00Z
Full Content:
New data shows that government-funded health insurance plans in the United States provide the majority of coverage for popular weight-loss drugs like Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+2.77%) Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.14%) Zepbound. Wegovy and Zepbound belong to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. The drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the specific use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have been hesitant to cover the treatments due to their high cost. Only about 65 million, or 25%, of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight-loss drugs, according to data from consulting firm Leverage. The firm’s AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus database tracks the insurance coverage of weight-loss treatments of roughly 80% of Americans. The majority of GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage comes from state Medicaid plans. Leverage estimates that Medicaid plans, which are government programs for low-income families, provide weight-loss drug coverage for 31.6 million people. Medicare only covers these treatments if they are prescribed to treat a second condition in addition to weight loss. Additionally, 20.6 million federal, state, and local government employees and their families have plans with weight-loss drug coverage. Together, these government-funded plans make up about 80%, or 52.2 million, of the Americans with weight-loss drug coverage. When it comes to private or employer-sponsored plans, these only provide GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage for 13.7 million people, according to the database. But because many employers don’t make the details of their plans public, Leverage estimates this number could be up to 24.4 million people. Without insurance, Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. A Morgan Stanley (MS+0.15%) survey conducted earlier this year among GLP-1 drug users, including those using the treatments for diabetes, found that about two-thirds of respondents had their medication fully covered by insurance. Those with out-of-pocket costs reported an average monthly cost of $196. Novo Nordisk claims that the majority of patients with insurance coverage pay $25 or less for a month’s supply of Ozempic or Wegovy. The drugs’ high list price and scarce insurance coverage have forced some people to turn to a growing copycat market. Some digital healthcare companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas have started selling compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs for hundreds of dollars cheaper than branded versions. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand-name drugs like Wegovy has spurred several healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision.

Title: Navigating The Trump 2.0 Market: What a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere.
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4279214/posts
Time Published: 2024-11-18T16:34:03Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/18/2024 8:34:03 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump and the Republican Party made a clean sweep in the US election. Some aspects of Trump’s campaign were a little vague, but we can be fairly certain of lower taxes and deregulation. That, and the strong US economy, should lead to higher corporate profits. On the other hand, the policies he plans to enact could be inflationary, and US government debt doesn’t look like it’s coming down anytime soon. This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency.

Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs.

However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term.

On the other hand, the policies he plans to enact could be inflationary, and US government debt doesn’t look like it’s coming down anytime soon. This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency.

That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: ProtectOurFreedom I moved most of my portfolio into cash the last few years under Biden: Money Markets, CD’s, short term US Treasuries. Since Trump won I have been slowly moving some of it back into 2 mutual funds(tech/large cap) that have done well for me long term. 6 posted on 11/18/2024 9:00:39 AM PST by aklurker [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: aklurker We are both retired (me 8 years, my wife 3 years) and have kept about 55% in equities. It’s been unnerving to ride the ups and downs, but it’s really paid off for us. My financial advisor and I frequently discuss when to trim equities, but the cash returns have been terrible. 7 posted on 11/18/2024 9:07:22 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 6 | View Replies] To: ProtectOurFreedom Yeah I retired in 2022, and moved from from about a 70/30 equity/bonds portfolio to about an 80/20 cash/equity portfolio in 2024 (election years presidential & midterms have been where my mutual funds have had negative returns the most in the past). I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January. Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen. 8 posted on 11/18/2024 9:22:14 AM PST by aklurker [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: aklurker “Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen.” I know what you mean. We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash. US equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety.

Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment.

Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 6 | View Replies] To: ProtectOurFreedom Yeah I retired in 2022, and moved from from about a 70/30 equity/bonds portfolio to about an 80/20 cash/equity portfolio in 2024 (election years presidential & midterms have been where my mutual funds have had negative returns the most in the past). I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January. Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen. 8 posted on 11/18/2024 9:22:14 AM PST by aklurker [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: aklurker “Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen.” I know what you mean. We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy.

Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome.

However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

Title: Jarden Wealth Weekly: Dissecting the Trump trades

Time Published: 2024-11-18T16:00:01Z
Full Content:
US President-elect Donald Trump. Photo / Getty Images Felix Fok is a chartered financial analyst at Jarden. OPINION Markets, by nature, are forward-looking, though they can occasionally get ahead of themselves. Following the recent United States election, stocks, bonds and currencies (crypto or otherwise) have moved in anticipation of what a second Donald Trump term could bring. Certain investments have been dubbed “Trump trades” due to their anticipated gains. However, the question remains: Do all these assets truly merit their upward momentum? The most direct link to Trump himself is Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), a US$6.6 billion ($11.2b) enterprise majority-owned by Trump. This company, operating the social media platform Truth Social, forms a significant part of his wealth. While the digital advertising landscape remains favourable where companies like Meta, Alphabet, Bytedance, and X (formerly Twitter) have effectively leveraged — DJT’s fundamentals are weak. Last quarter, DJT reported just US$1 million in revenue and a net loss of US$19m. Additionally, they saw a 20% increase in shares, diluting existing shareholder value. Nonetheless, DJT’s market value has surged 70% this year, likely fuelled by speculation of a possible partnership with the Elon Musk-controlled X. Notably, DJT shares declined after the election win, underscoring the mixed market sentiment towards this stock. Tesla and Musk’s political leverage: Musk’s public alignment with the Republican campaign has proven beneficial. Tesla shares have rallied significantly post-election, benefitting from political factors and a rebound in profit margins in the last quarter. Musk’s new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (the “Doge”) grants him influence, though it’s unclear how this position will directly benefit electric vehicle (EV) sales. Musk’s political proximity could translate into ongoing incentives for EV adoption, government contracts, or lenient regulations for autonomous vehicle trials. However, the Biden-era US$7500 per car EV tax credit looks set to end based on early indications from Trump’s transition team. This would be a negative for Tesla in the near term until weaker EV competitors exit the market. Given that half of Tesla’s revenue is generated outside the US with 23% coming from China, the Shanghai manufacturing base may provide some protection against US-China tensions. Yet, broad-based trade tariffs could slow Tesla’s global growth and reduce demand for premium consumer products. Ultimately, while having the President-elect’s ear is valuable, the potential benefits may be more significant for Musk’s other (unlisted) ventures, particularly SpaceX, and with this, there could be a shift in Musk’s attention within his businesses going forward. Cryptocurrency rally and the appeal of Bitcoin: Trump’s vow to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the planet” has fuelled optimism within the cryptocurrency market, with many expecting the appointment of a pro-crypto regulator at the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite ongoing debates over crypto’s utility and associated risks, bitcoin’s performance can be distilled to supply and demand dynamics. Unlike DJT shares, bitcoin supply is limited by its programming, and the available supply is likely much less than stated due to early misplacing of passwords and dormant accounts. As the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has withstood major downturns and forks (the spawning of copycat coins) over the past 15 years, and it now stands at an all-time high. Demand tends to follow price momentum, with more investors buying in as prices rise. In high-inflation environments, such as in some developing countries, there is demand for bitcoin as a digital “store of value” alternative to government-issued currencies. Although remote, a US strategic bitcoin reserve remains a blue-sky scenario, making bitcoin a highly asymmetric yet risky proposition. Domestic resilience: In the broader context, the US economy has shown resilience. Employment remains strong, with the unemployment rate in the low 4% range, and property prices have risen moderately. Domestic banks and financial services companies may gain from tax cuts, deregulation, and other policies aimed at economic growth while remaining somewhat insulated from trade tariffs and policies affecting undocumented workers. Increased government spending and domestic investment could keep interest rates higher than anticipated, supporting banks’ interest income. Additional domestic sectors, such as private prisons and transportation, may also benefit, as will the US dollar. However, certain companies may face headwinds from potential labour shortages or declining commodity prices if global growth stalls amid rising supply. Large US multinationals, particularly those with significant US cost bases, may see a mixed impact through higher US dollar and weaker global markets. Risk vs opportunity: Given the uncertainty around timing and impact, investors likely have not fully repositioned portfolios for this new landscape, leaving further upside in some Trump trades if policies and execution materialise. Ultimately, not all Trump trades are created equal: some are grounded in stronger fundamentals, while others may be fuelled by sentiment alone. Investors must weigh how much of the anticipated benefit is already priced in. In the months ahead, attention will naturally shift to cabinet and committee nominations, policy details, and a clearer assessment of value. Buyer beware.

Title: Barclays Highlights Key Semiconductor Trends Including Nvidia Blackwell Ramp and Apple iPhone Cuts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Traders work on the floor during the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on March 9, 2020 in ... [+] New York. - Trading on Wall Street was temporarily halted early March 9, 2020 as US stocks joined a global rout on crashing oil prices and mounting worries over the coronavirus.The suspension was triggered after the S&P 500's losses hit seven percent. Near 1340 GMT, the broad-based index was down more than 200 points at 2,764.21. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) The Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell all but finalized a decision last week - interest rates are unlikely to be cut in the Fed’s December meeting. Inflation risk isn’t gone yet. Chair Powell’s Fed likely sees inflation as a real risk - no, a massive threat due to the possibility of persistent, sticky inflation - like the one that resulted in an almost 50% drop in S&P 500 from 1972 to 1974 (see Market Crashes Compared). Giants like Nvidia can drop even more. How much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $45 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $20 trillion in value. And you thought the $2 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first three days of August was bad. To make matters worse, persistent inflation combined with high interest rates hurt smaller companies the most - magnifying the impact on the Russell 2000 small cap index. (Do you know how the Trefis HQ strategy, which has outperformed S&P, works with downside protection?) There are three ingredients: tariffs, deportations, and low taxes. In combination, this is a combustible mixture that would make it difficult for the Fed to fight an inflation spike in coming months, and running into 2025 as the Trump presidency kicks off. Of course, Trump might not implement policies around tariffs, deportations, and lower taxes that he promised. Or, let’s hope they’re not as severe as he’s promised on the campaign trail. But if he does, inflation will potentially head north in a hurry. The rules are simple. Higher tariffs would take cheaper goods out of the market. Prices would rise. Mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except it’ll make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. Now while tariffs and deportations constrain supply of goods and services to increase prices - reduction in taxes makes more cash available. So people can spend more while prices are higher. High consumer willingness to pay will lead to higher prices - fueling yet higher expectations for prices. The result would be spiking inflation. The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook that it never got a chance to really put away: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings, a risk-free investment - won’t you demand a higher earnings and return from stocks as well? Of course. There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that Nvidia had lost more than 50% in 2022 alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?), and trillions had been wiped from the market cap of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta with each tech giant seeing a drop of 40% or more. Smaller firms, with less cash on their balance sheets did even worse. The difference is, in 2022 inflation was brought under control. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together are likely to prove a stronger force - a more persistent force. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently raised a big red flag about the now $1 trillion in annual interest payments the U.S. owes on its debt. This is unprecedented. It is uncharted territory. And a higher interest rate on Treasury securities only means even higher interest payments. The last thing investor sentiments can take during weak market conditions is a possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt. Things could unravel very quickly under such a situation. Market crashes typically happen because someone can’t pay back their loans. For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while. Covid-19’s work-from-home gift was a big curse for the retail and office real-estate sector. In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break - especially if the Fed is forced to hike interest rates. And then, there are consumer defaults - personal loans, auto loans, and credit card loans in particular. That makes banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and BofA with large credit card books vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). This isn’t going to end well. When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession.

Title: Nvidia is having problems with its hot new AI chip as earning loom

Time Published: 2024-11-18T15:17:00Z
Full Content:
After facing delays for its new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia (NVDA-3.26%) reportedly has a new problem — one that has its customers worried. The Information, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Nvidia has repeatedly asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected. Nvidia’s customers are reportedly worried about a delay for the server racks, which combine 72 of the AI chips in hope that larger AI models can be trained faster with more chips. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reports, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. On Sunday, Dell (DELL+2.83%) chief executive Michael Dell posted on X that Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks are shipping, and that Dell had delivered server racks to CoreWeave. “NVIDIA GB200 systems are the most advanced computers ever created. Integrating them into a diverse range of data center environments requires co-engineering with our customers,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While our customers race to be first to market, NVIDIA is working with leading CSPs as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected.” Nvidia’s production and shipping delays for Blackwell were also caused by a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, Huang said. The chipmaker had to work with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.55%), to resolve the engineering setback. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” Nvidia is set to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.31%). Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia stock was down by about 2.5% during Monday morning trading, but the shares are up about 187% so far this year.

Title: Buy, Sell Or Hold CSCO Stock?

AUSTIN, TEXAS - OCTOBER 02: Carrie Palin, Cisco speaks on stage during 2024 Texas Conference for ... [+] Women at Austin Convention Center on October 02, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by Marla Aufmuth/Getty Images for Texas Conference for Women) Note: Cisco’s FY 2024 ended July 27, 2024 Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company providing networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, grew marginally by 0.8% on Wednesday, 13th November to $59, as compared to flat growth in the S&P 500 index. In comparison, CSCO’s peer Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has seen its stock down 1.5% to around $180 on the same day. The company reported $13.8 billion in revenue (in line with guidance) in the fiscal first quarter, representing a 6% decline year-over-year (y-o-y). Despite a revenue decline this quarter, the company’s stock is up 17% so far ytd. Its AI infrastructure investments and product order growth (up 20% y-o-y in Q3) are a big win for the company. Cisco’s Q1 earnings per share stood out, with a GAAP EPS of $0.68 and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, both surpassing earlier guidance, driven by robust gross margins and favorable tax effects. However, if you are bearish on the markets, here is a possible negative scenario: S&P To Crash More Than 40%? For the second quarter, Cisco provided a steady outlook, projecting Q2 revenue between $13.75 billion and $13.95 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 to $0.91. These numbers demonstrate expectations of a stabilization phase, fueled by recent strategic changes, with AI and security tools poised for significant growth. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion, from $55 billion to $56.2 billion previously. It also lifted its earnings per share projection to between $2.26 and $2.38, up from $1.93 to $2.05. The increase in CSCO stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 46% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 9% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could CSCO face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Cisco’s Q1 segment performance was mixed, with security revenues doubling y-o-y, and networking revenues declining 23% y-o-y. Broadly, its product revenue declined 9%, while service revenue increased 6%, highlighting the industry’s shift towards service-centric solutions. Cisco’s product sales have witnessed a slowdown as customers have been focused on installing and implementing the products purchased over the last few quarters. Moreover, large companies, including cloud service providers and telecommunication players, have held back on network-related capital expenditures on account of economic uncertainty. Separately, Cisco is also facing competition from smaller networking companies and this is also impacting growth. The company’s financials revealed varied regional outcomes as well. In Q1, the company’s revenue in the Americas and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) declined, contrasting with APJC’s (Asia Pacific, Japan, and China) modest growth. Cisco has been making progress with gross margins in recent quarters, driven by lower freight and component costs, a favorable product mix, and overall better cost management. On a GAAP basis, CSCO’s total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin were 65.9%, 65.1%, and 68.0%, respectively, as compared with 65.2%, 64.5%, and 67.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We could see similar trends over Q2 as well. The company has been increasingly pushing toward a recurring revenue model with its software subscriptions and service contracts which could also help margins. Cisco’s recent purchase of Splunk underscores its commitment to expanding its security offerings. This move aligns with the company’s broader strategy to bolster its capabilities in AI-driven threat detection and response. The company intends to cross-sell Splunk products to drive revenue synergies, indicating that it has identified about 5,000 existing Cisco customers that could also become Splunk customers. Splunk is a software player that provides tools to analyze log files, and other data, using artificial intelligence to help companies minimize the risk of cybersecurity incidents. We believe CSCO stock is appropriately priced at current levels. The stock trades at just about 23x consensus earnings for FY’25. We think this is a reasonable valuation, even though growth for this year is likely to be muted. Cisco’s push into the recurring revenue model and its increasing focus on cybersecurity, via acquisitions, could help the stock. We also believe that the company will perform better than its big tech peers in the event of a potential economic downturn given its lower valuation and the secular spending trends on digitization and networking. We value CSCO stock at about $57 per share, which is in line with the current market price. See our analysis of Cisco Valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for the stock.

Title: After losing 33% in the past year, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-33-past-cracker-barrel-113615439.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 7 shareholders own 52% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock Every investor in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.5% increase in the share price after a year of 33% losses as a sign that returns may to begin trending higher. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. Check out our latest analysis for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Cracker Barrel Old Country Store does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 9.3% of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 9.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Biglari Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$15m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store . But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

According to VOA, the US is doing “soul searching” about its mission in the Sahel region of Africa — and largely finding the same answers. Maj. General Ekman, who oversaw the recent US withdrawal from Niger which was completed in September, said Niger’s expulsion of US forces will not change the American mission. “How we will pursue [those objectives], either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table,” he said. Before the government overthrows in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, the US had hundreds of forces in two Niger bases that served as what Washington calls counterterrorism hubs. Burkina Faso and Mali also hosted American Special Forces teams. If there was hope that the removal of US forces from these countries would lead to a rethink of the AFRICOM mission in the region, that is not coming to pass. The US is instead upping its presence in neighboring countries Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Benin. “If our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian-based VEO [violent extremist organization] threat, we now have to revert to going outside in,” Ekman said. Source: Map of the Sahel region in Saharan Africa. Credit: Peter Fitzgerald/LtPowers/Wikimedia Commons. The Sahel, a vast region spanning parts of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, is known for its economic hardship and violence, but the new governments in these nations are taking major steps towards breaking free from foreign influence and asserting local sovereignty . There’s a lot of hope. As Stanley Kwabla Arku, a Ghanaian journalist with Pan African Television, writes: The Sahel’s recent shifts have ignited a movement against foreign military involvement, particularly French influence, which many local voices say has fueled conflict and stymied economic progress. This groundswell of anti-imperialist sentiment has resulted in what organizers describe as “patriotic uprisings,” led by popular forces and progressive alliances within state institutions like the military. These uprisings have reshaped governance in the region, as people demand sovereignty and work to assert a more independent future. These aspirations are running up against violent constraints, however, as US military officials say ‘I told you so.’ From The African: The pursuit of economic prosperity and healthy sovereignty by Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, is likely to be waylaid as terrorism continues to undermine country and regional security and stability…The Africa Centre for Strategy Studies estimates that the 11 643 fatalities in the Sahel during 2023 represent a “near threefold increase” from levels seen in 2020 and a “record high” in militant Islamic-group violence since the “peak of the Boko Haram violence in 2015”…The road towards self-determination, sustainable development and sovereignty is potholed by persistent violent attacks by Islamic militant groups. Weakened by these constant attacks, the three junta governments are unable to get on with the business of stabilising and governing their countries. “They’re absolutely feeling [the loss of Western military personnel],” a senior US military official told VOA. A big reason why is that the US and France are helping to drive the violence, including uusing Ukraine, much the same way they do with Israel, to destabilize nations and regions that threaten Western capital. Ukraine Terrorist Inc. The US’ purported mission in the Sahel is to fight “terrorism,” which somehow always gets worse despite the American operations. The terrorists are now being assisted by the US proxy state of Ukraine. Kiev supported a July attack by Tuareg rebels in Mali that killed Malian government troops and Wagner Group mercenaries, likely with an assist from other Western governments. Some background: Since 2013, France has been assisting the Malian government in a fight against paramilitary groups. However, after the 2020 coup, Paris refused to recognise the new government and pushed the western-backed Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to impose severe economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Mali. In response, Mali expelled French forces and withdrew from ECOWAS, turning to Moscow for support. The Ukrainians are actively training and equipping terrorist groups, which means in a roundabout way that the likes of the US and France are working with the very same extremist groups they’re purportedly there to fight. Mali and Niger have since ended diplomatic relations with Ukraine, and Russia’s standing only improves in the region where it signs economic, energy, and defense deals. It’s another reminder of just how spectacularly the Ukraine gambit to isolate and collapse Russia does the opposite. France’s overseas interests have been decimated over the past few years. France got the boot from what now constitutes the Confederation of the Alliance of Sahel States ( AES – Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger). And Paris failed to get ECOWAS to militarily intervene against the AES. Desperate to reverse its downfall in the region, Paris is working with Kiev to terrorize populations and discredit governments in the Sahel. If one wonders about why France continues to pour money into Ukraine (the “Anne of Kyiv” brigade—a nod to the medieval Ukrainian princess who became Queen of France— just completed over two months of training with French military forces in eastern and southern France), the Sahel might provide some clues. The forces involved in the Mali attack were from a coalition of armed separatist groups consisting of the Cadre Stratégique pour la Défense du Peuple de l’Azawad (CSP-DPA) and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for Supporters of Islam and Muslims (JNIM), which reportedly received training from Ukrainian forces in Mauritania and Ukraine. A CSP-DPA spokesman downplayed any special ties to Ukraine’s intelligence services, however, saying “We have links with the Ukrainians, but just as we have with everyone else, the French, Americans, and others.” Good to know. *** Sahel states are increasingly demanding more compensation from mining operations and outright nationalizing them. Three out of four light bulbs in France were reportedly powered by Nigerien uranium. In contrast, only 10 to 20 percent of Nigeriens in urban areas have access to electricity, while roughly 3 percent do in the rural areas. That is changing. Members of West Africa’s anti-imperialist bloc – the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) – have made multiple headlines this year by taking back control of their mining resources. Burkina Faso recently nationalised two gold mines; Niger expelled French mining company Orano from its… pic.twitter.com/jeos9AE8SA — African Stream (@african_stream) September 30, 2024 Kodjovi Kpachavi, an organizer with the Black Alliance for Peace and the All-African People’s Revolutionary Party, notes the damage this is doing to Orano: In July, Orano shared that its 2024 operating income (i.e. revenue minus expenses) had decreased from $289 million in the first half of 2023 to $13 million in the first half of 2024 . This equates to a loss of 80% of their operating income compared to 2023. While publicly they have attempted to save face, Orano losing their primary supply of uranium has forced them to attempt to revive old mines near the end of their life-cycle in Canada and negotiate new deals with Kazakhstan, a country that they had been avoiding due to their relationship with Russia . In addition to enlisting to the help of Ukrainian forces to train and arm African paramilitaries, Paris and Brussels are so frustrated they’ve enlisted the dreaded special representative to the Sahel, noting that the region “is of strategic importance to the EU in terms of security and stability, international climate and sustainable development commitments and migration routes linked to Europe.” No doubt. Meanwhile, western mining firms are up in arms. From the Financial Times: John Meyer, partner at corporate advisory firm SP Angel, said the new rules represented a “significant increase in the effective taxation of miners” operating in the country. “A near worst-case scenario now appears to be evolving whereby companies are being required to hand over a further 15 per cent of their projects in Mali for very little in the way of compensation,” he said. “The situation will dissuade many companies from further investment in Mali, and we suspect all but the most essential exploration will stop.” However, Barrick is sanguine about its prospects of resolving its dispute in Mali, which accounts for 13 per cent of the company’s gold production. Since the sovereignist governments in Sahel nations got interested in obtaining more profit share of mines, the operations are coming under increasing attack: Graphs from the Global Terrorism Index 2024 report reveal non-state organizations’ interest in gold mines in the Sahel region. In addition to gold, oil, uranium, natural gas, and lithium mines are also the focus of organizations in the Sahel region. pic.twitter.com/2H3FgYPs76 — Levent Kemal (@leventkemaI) May 8, 2024 Meanwhile, imperial stooges like Mathew Edds-Reitman, a program manager at the US Institute of Peace, explain that the Sahel violence is the result of overthrowing Western-backed governments and that the “best way to protect” these states and their populations “is to buttress their democracy and resilience.” Democracy and resilience. Those are, of course, code words for Western capital interests and their governments’ forces. It’s difficult to discern how Edds-Reitman “analysis” is any different from the mafia issuing veiled threats (“shame if something were to happen”) while simultaneously offering “protection.” So what is the true AFRICOM mission? Many argue it’s to perpetuate violence in order to keep the Americans in and make nations reliant on Western military support and hardware. As Abayomi Azikiwe, the editor of Pan-African News Wire, writes: The idea behind AFRICOM and the French counterparts known as Operation Barkhane and the G5, was to train the post-colonial military forces in the ethos of imperialism. For years many of these regimes, whether bourgeois democratic or military, provided diplomatic and political cover for the continuation of the exploitation of African resources and labor. Once those same Western-trained and equipped forces threw out Western advisers and businesses (or demanded a fairer shake), the fact that Ukrainians began assisting African paramilitaries and attacks on mines jumped indicate that the governments in Paris and Washington are resorting to terrorism in an attempt to keep the Sahel states under their control as. The Incoming Trump Administration and AFRICOM As the New Not-So Cold War between Washington and Moscow spills into the Sahel, could a Trump-led detente with Russia lead to a pull back in US forces from the region. There are reasons to doubt that. AFRICOM has faced the prospect of having its operations scaled back before. As Nick Turse reported back in 2020: Facing a potential drawdown of forces, AFRICOM has been making the case that its bases and the missions run from them are integral to U.S. interests. “Strategic access to Africa, its airspace, and its surrounding waters is vital to U.S. national security,” Townsend told the Senate Armed Services Committee late last month. He and others have argued for what they contend is AFRICOM’s supposed bang for the buck. “What U.S. Africa Command accomplishes with relatively few people and few dollars, on a continent three-and-a-half times the size of the continental United States, is a bargain for the American taxpayer,” Manley told The Intercept. [1] The argument goes that African minerals are critical to US national security to reduce dependency on China – something to keep in mind with the arrival of Team Trump China hawks. Yet at the same time, Western firms have been selling off mines to China. For example, Chinese companies have spent the past decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the DRC’s Cobalt belt, leading to control of 15 of 19 of the primary cobalt mines in the country. about 80 percent of the world’s cobalt processing occurs in China before being incorporated into lithium-ion batteries. The US has little business interests itself in the Sahel where French, Australian, Canadian, and UK mining companies took the lead. The US is instead turning its attention to the wealthier coastal countries of West Africa, particularly along critical Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes where the US conducts about $4 billion in two-way trade (and where reports are that China wants to eventually open its second African military base). A report from Africa Intelligence indicates that the U.S. is preparing additional military aid for several West African nations, with a particular focus on Ghana, Benin, and Côte d’Ivoire. It will be interesting to see if that fact affects the outlook of the incoming Trump administration, which could potentially be eyeing a more isolationist stance. If that’s the case, the US could leave French and other Western nations to sort out their own business in the Sahel. Director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard is an interesting case. While she has long opposed US interventionist wars, she’s also offered complete support for Israel and is a big believer in “radical Islamic ideology” fueling terrorism. She seems to prefer to fight that ideology with small teams and Obama-style drone waves leading some to view her nomination in a negative light: I tweeted about her being in Africa’s Sahel, back in 2021 (in my lost account), when she went to supervise training of al Qaeda in Africa. Her “go after” is of course nonsense since both al Qaeda & ISIS are mercenaries led by the US She is now officially the Terrorists Big Boss https://t.co/uEGO93zhUh pic.twitter.com/TKDFAa9axE — Cindy Somemore (@cindysomemore) November 13, 2024 If the incoming administration is hyper-focused on China, which appears to be the case, it stands to reason the US will be active in Africa with one of the few tools the US has: the military. That’s because China happens to be dominating Africa. While American big tech, aspects of which are cozy with Team Trump, are competing with Chinese companies for dominance in Africa, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron have operations across Africa, US interests are mostly dwarfed by Beijing. Ken Opalo, a political scientist at Georgetown University, writes at An Africanist Perspective: Importantly, France is no longer the undisputed major power when it comes to francophone African countries’ foreign relations. The last two decades have seen China supplant France as these countries’ largest trade partner. China is now a bigger trade trade partner for francophone African states than the United States, the United Kingdom, and France combined. More recently, countries like the Central African Republic (CAR), Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali have forged closer security ties with Russia. France’s situation looks even worse when one considers its share of total trade to/from its former African colonies. Among these countries, French share of trade plummeted from more than a quarter in the early 1990s to just over 5%. Here’s how it looks for Africa as a whole: Source: Ken Opalo With Beijing’s heavy presence comes risk, however. And there is the line of thinking that chaos in Africa, and the Sahel in particular, damages China, which is a consolation prize for the West losing influence. For example, oil is once again flowing through a Chinese pipeline from Niger to Benin’s seaport, but it has come under attack in recent months. More from Geopolitical Futures: Beijing could, however, scale back or block unsuccessful and riskier economic projects, including those in Niger, if there is not the return of at least a modicum of stability. The African turmoil does not allow the People’s Republic to develop a true transcontinental corridor any time soon, making the creation of a military base on the Atlantic less pressing. Such a base would be a useful lookout to the west, but would remain isolated, far from the Chinese coast and Djibouti. It’s essentially a scorched earth retreat. And that decision is likely to boomerang on them like so many others. Western governments are now complaining about how Russia is allegedly helping Yemen’s Houthis close the Red Sea to western shipping. We see how France’s interests in Africa have collapsed, with Moscow potentially giving a little push to that house of cards. It was irresponsible, yet fitting, for Western governments to think they could launch a proxy war against Russia and not face some consequences elsewhere. Russia, China, and others are increasingly refusing to just sit back and be targets, but are instead harming Western economic interests in kind. And the full-fledged backing of terrorism in the Sahel is only damaging the West’s position there. Now as France is being pushed out, Washington fears the increasing presence of Russia and China. Africom’s commander Michael E. Langley has accused Russia and China of leading a disinformation campaign in the Sahel to undermine U.S. influence in West and Central Africa. As the US expands its presence in coastal west africa, analysts caution that the expanding American military footprint in West Africa could inadvertently provide terrorist groups with more fuel for the fire. Well that’s not a bad outcome if the goal is self-perpetuating conflict. It’s well-known even in the US that Indeed, a 2011 report from the US House of Representatives Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence tried to explain Boko Haram’s popularity. Reasons included “a feeling of alienation from the wealthier, Christian, oil-producing, southern Nigeria, pervasive poverty, rampant government corruption, heavy-handed security measures, and the belief that relations with the West are a corrupting influence.” The response? Nigeria, which had been transforming into an arm of US Africa Command ever since the dawn of the “War on Terror”, executed Boko Haram’s leader and state forces began killing or displacing thousands of Nigerian Muslims. And everything has gone pretty much according to plan since then. From MR Online: It’s not as if strategists don’t understand that violence doesn’t work. They understand that violence escalates violence which can then be used as pretexts for more violence. A U.S. Council on Foreign Relations article from 2020 notes: “the last two years have been deadlier than any other period for Nigerian soldiers since the Boko Haram insurgency began.” Hanna Eid, writing at Al Mayadeen, compares the Western-backed terror campaign to the CIA post-WWII Operation Gladio, which used fascist stay-behind armies to destabilize and discredit Socialist governments and Communist parties in Europe. The legacy of that successful operation is what we see today: a European political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants. We’ll see if the Sahel nations fare better than Europe did. Reasons for Hope While analysts write that the US “lost” the Sahel, they also stress that Russia will not be a “savior.” This misses the fact that the people of the region are not looking for a savior but instead a fair deal for resources, as well as things like infrastructure, industry, and technology transfer. Russia and China, at least for now, check those boxes. Despite the increasing violence in the region, driven at least in part by the West, progress is evident — contrary to Western reports of oppressive autocracy — and demanding more money from the mining operations is a big part of it. In Burkina Faso, for example, “the current administration is subsidizing the cost of agricultural equipment for farmers and has set a goal to increase the productivity of irrigated areas by at least 50%.” Kpachavi writes: The [Alliance of Sahel States]’s development of roads, hospitals, health programs, agricultural programs, factories , reforestation programs , safety and security initiatives , women’s unions , and more have been deliberately ignored by western media. And more important details from Inemesit Richardson, the co-founder of The Thomas Sankara Center for African Liberation and Unity, a Pan-African library and political education center based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: …there is very little that has happened within the AES that did not begin first as a call emanating from the grassroots. The reason why AES leaders are so beloved by their people is because they have consistently submitted to the people’s will. There would not even be an Alliance of Sahel States in any form if the AES leaders did not listen to the cries of their people to form one. Mass mobilisations led by civil society organizations called for the removal of French troops from the soils of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. The leaders heard this call and followed the demands of their people. Niger was at the vanguard of calling for the expulsion of US troops as well, civilians having protested against AFRICOM’s presence for many years. …People in the Sahel today are very perceptive and understand the strategies and tactics of imperialism. They know that the current imperialist talking point is that ‘both sides are bad’ or that they need ‘neither Russia nor France’ and they don’t fall for this rhetoric anymore. People also appreciate partnerships with Iran for similar reasons. Iran is a powerful country that has a great capacity to defend itself and resist imperialist aggression. Countries like Russia and Iran are important to the people of the Sahel because, beyond collaborating within the areas of security, they offer the AES countries a pathway towards industrialization through the creation of factories, refineries, and power plants. It would seem that the new leaders, with help from “Axis of Evil” countries, are providing material benefits to the people as opposed to what came before: ever-worsening violence, brutal poverty, and off the charts corruption. Following that, Russia doesn’t have to do much to come out like a “savior.” Notes [1] Turse’s piece goes on to note an inspector general’s report examining U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa, which notes that “the threat posed by al Shabaab and ISIS-Somalia in East Africa remains ‘high,’ despite continued U.S. airstrikes and training of Somali security forces,” the Defense Intelligence Agency told the Defense Department’s Inspector General. The DoDIG further noted that al-Shabab not only “remains a potent threat” due to its “ability to conduct high-profile attacks, recruit fighters, and finance ongoing operations,” but that the group “appears to be a growing threat to U.S. personnel and interests in the region.” Thank you for this extensive coverage. In the bad old days of the 60s, they would use mercenaries to impose western control of African resources. So you had men like “Mad Mike” Hoare running around with their own mercenary formations. But that was then and this is now. These days mercenaries have been corporatized so you now have terrorists doing the same sort of work. Having Ukrainians there is for the purposes of plausible deniability of the US and France. I do not think that China and Russia will just sit back and take these attacks on themselves and their African allies but will leverage their extensive technical capabilities. They will use their satellite coverage to scope out the local battlefields and train the locals extensively in the use of their own drones along with battle-tested tactics. But if the US and France ups their attacks, then they may find their own bases come under attack by local proxies just to spread the joy. And it has not escaped my notice that the Sahel region cuts Africa in two on a east-west axis so a major reason for the fight for it. In a way, it is a reflection of the British trying to cut Africa in half vertically with their Cape to Cairo railway under the influence of Cecil Rhodes in the 19th century- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_Railway Thank you, Rev. Your comment reminds me of the use of, ahem, contractors to guard property, either ours* or clients’, at HSBC* two decades ago. We would go to Mayfair and meet a well spoken and well to do former officer, usually foot guards, but sometimes cavalry, to discuss the transaction mechanics, operational risks and fees. The boots on the ground tended to be from the ranks with perhaps a former NCO or a former officer in charge. *Initially, we came to own property briefly when transacting under Islamic law, but later did under English law for a fee. South Africa’s Executive Outcomes has returned and operated against Boko, not BoJo, Haram in the Sahel. The UK’s Saladin has personnel from the defunct Keenie Meenie Services, involved in Sri Lanka alongside Bell Pottinger, also responsible for the White Helmets. The USA’s L3 MPRI, active in the former Yugoslavia, is now part of Engility. In the years ahead, there will be much Ukrainian muscle available. One wonders if the weaponry will also flood western markets, like it did as the Yugoslav wars petered out. So you had men like “Mad Mike” Hoare running around with their own mercenary formations. In those “heroic” times there also was the (in)famous Bob Denard. Even then, however, there was a lot of government involvement. Remember how the CIA recruited mercenaries to fight for Unita and the FNLA in Angola in 1975-6, and how Hoare and company eventually took part in the failed attempt to seize the Seychelles, almost certainly with South African backing. “We’ll see if the Sahel nations fare better than Europe did.” LOL. “Finish him!” *crude, oriental techno plays* “Hanna Eid, writing at Al Mayadeen, compares the Western-backed terror campaign to the CIA post-WWII Operation Gladio, which used fascist stay-behind armies to destabilize and discredit Socialist governments and Communist parties in Europe. The legacy of that successful operation is what we see today: a European political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants.” Indeed. But waiting for the responses about how “complicated” it is to call a fascist when you see one. “Sahel states are increasingly demanding more compensation from mining operations and outright nationalizing them. Three out of four light bulbs in France were reportedly powered by Nigerien uranium. In contrast, only 10 to 20 percent of Nigeriens in urban areas have access to electricity, while roughly 3 percent do in the rural areas…” Which all reminds me about the history of the Volta Dam ( Akosombo Dam) in Ghana and Western mining interests. And now Ghana and West Africa are the fall back positions for Western military in the Sahel… “The Ukrainians are actively training and equipping terrorist groups…” Another example of the blowback potential from the war in Ukraine. They will also train and equip terrorists in Europe and eventually in the USA. Those Ukrainian “soldiers” will be bored once the major fighting in Ukraine is over and they will love to become “contractors” for good pay in Europe & North America just as what is happening in Israel. Armed, indoctrinated and unemployed testosterone is a dangerous thing. They will be convinced that the West used them and won’t be happy. The UAE and the Gulf in general is ripe for the disruption and some of these Uke guys have seafaring skills as well. Armed to the teeth, full of hate, and looking for work. We’re in for decades of chaos thanks to our leadership class. Aww, it breaks my heart learning that Tulsi is an Al Qaeda trainer. :-( However at the same time she is an Assad apologist because she’s against the war in Syria. I don’t get it: usually only banks or weapons dealers play both sides and she doesn’t look like one. What am I missing, provided it is not fake news? Any documentation that Tulsi is an Al Qaeda trainer? Quite curious actually. If she’s going to be Director of National Intelligence then she’ll be in charge of ISIS and al-Qaeda. Unless Trump disowns them, which is hard to imagine. I don’t think that is correct. They are run out of the CIA and even though the DNI sits over the CIA, it does not control CIA day to day ops. In fact, I have read of the DNI not wanting to be informed of stuff the CIA was up to for plausible deniability reasons. Your email address will not be published.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.” – Albert Einstein (1953) Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a discussion by Roy Spencer on adjustments that may be needed on the record high temperature recorded in Death Valley California. Kenneth Richard suggests five papers that indicate that increasing CO2 may have an insignificant influence on global temperatures. Roger Caiazza discusses problems New York State may have in meeting its energy goals, particularly replacing fossil fuels and nuclear with alternatives. Matt Ridley points out that the recent flooding of Valencia may be the result of eliminating flood control dams. Comments on the beginning of COP-29 are presented. An article by an academic illustrates what is too frequently missed in academic analyses of energy policy. ********************* A Fallen Icon? Roy Spencer continued his essays exploring the widely accepted high temperature for the United States of 134° F (57° C) recorded at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley California (now called Furnace Creek Ranch) on July 10, 1913. John Christy prompted Spencer to look into this record. Recently, after extensive historical research, William Reidd doubted the record and suggested the new observer in 1913 was disillusioned by the low readings taken at the official weather station. He may have substituted readings from his front porch of official readings. Reid provided a photograph showing that the official station was located by an irrigated alfalfa field, which was not a typical the desert location. In the summer, irrigation in the desert lowers daytime high temperatures and raises nighttime low temperatures. So, the siting of the weather station was poor, and it probably produced high temperature readings that were too low for the area, but that is not known. Spencer states: “In my experience, unless the vegetation area is rather large, and there is almost no wind, a weather station’s daily maximum temperature will still be largely determined by air flowing from the larger-scale desert surroundings. But note… this is different from, say a poorly sited thermometer next to a brick wall or heat pump where hot air from an isolated source can elevate the daily maximum temperature recorded).” Spencer analyzes maximum temperatures for the 27 surrounding stations up to 100 miles away from Death Valley and at different elevations for the period 1935 to 1938. Then he examines the maximum temperatures for the 3 to 7 stations during 1912 to 1915 and finds significant disparity from the Death Valley records. Spencer then provides a statistical analysis based on lapse rate to adjust for the different elevations in this dry climate. He concludes: “The 134 deg. F world record hottest temperature from Death Valley is likely around 10 deg. F too high, compared to elevation-adjusted temperatures from surrounding stations. The most likely cause is that the ranch foreman’s reported measurements were (shall we say) unacademically recorded. I find it rather remarkable that the world record hottest temperature from Death Valley was not revised many years ago, since the methods for “fact checking” the record are fairly simple and based upon meteorological principles known for well over 50 years.” So, we do not know what the highest temperature recorded in the US is. It may be around 10° F, 6° C too high. Until NOAA began manipulating the US surface temperature records in the early part of the 21st century with no clear justification and no record of changes, the US record was the best in the world covering a large area. One wonders how many of the surface records used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators can stand up to the rigorous examination Roy Spencer did on the Greenland Ranch record. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Miniscule Effect of CO2: Kenneth Richard discusses six papers: one that asserts that CO2 is the control knob of Earth’s temperatures and five that refute that assertion. In addressing the claim that CO2’s climate effects are undetectable Richard states: “Of course, this very unfalsifiable thought experiment is what believers in the CO2-is-the-climate-control-knob narrative rest their case on. But even if we do use this imaginary-world premise, the existing models (MODTRAN, HITRAN) that allegedly support the CO2-controls-climate orthodoxy actually undermine it.” Richard then discusses five papers that contradict the CO2 controls-climate notion. He does not discuss the contradictions TWTW prefers. The papers from van Wijngaarden and Happer use the high resolution HITRAN spectroscopy as discussed in last week’s TWTW, under Updating HITRAN. In their papers van Wijngaarden and Happer have convincingly demonstrated that adding CO2 to the atmosphere has a miniscule effect on temperatures. For example, see Figure 7 in their “The Role of Greenhouse Gases in Energy Transfer in the Earth’s Atmosphere.” These estimates are well tested using satellite data over Guam (tropics), the Sahara (desert); Mediterranean (mid-latitudes) and the Antarctic (polar regions). Based on these calculations, the overall impact of CO2 at current concentrations is less than 25% of the greenhouse effect, and doubling CO2 concentration would add a mere 2%. Water vapor accounts for almost all of the effect. The one issue that is still not clear is clouds. The calculations by van Wijngaarden and Happer are for clear skies. Clouds are extremely complicated, and no one has developed an adequate theory for their formation and dissipation. However, their overall influence will reduce the warming of Earth from the greenhouse effect. This was seen during the Little Ice Age in Europe, when skies were overcast, growing seasons were short, and crops frequently did not ripen properly in the northern parts of Europe. Diseases attributed to mycotoxins formed by moldy grain were common.

Dispatchable means that the power source can be adjusted to match the electricity demand. Nuclear, coal, and similar power plants require time to adjust. Gas and Combined Cycle Gas Generation can be adjusted in less time. Gas turbines require little time. Wind and solar cannot be adjusted to increase output unless they are operating under capacity for current weather conditions. Large hydropower can be adjusted quickly. New York State, which has no additional hydropower practically possible, has closed all but three nuclear power plants. No one has identified a Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource to fill increasing state needs. Given these conditions, Roger Caiazza who analyzes electricity needs for New York State discusses “Renewable Transition Raw Materials Challenge” based on the Bulletin 416 of the Bulletins of the Geological Survey of Finland, which “publishes the results of scientific research that is thematically or geographically connected to Finnish or Fennoscandian geology.” The Abstract of a paper referenced in the bulletin is “Scope of the replacement system to globally phase out fossil fuels” which states: “The task to phase out fossil fuels is now at hand. Most studies and publications to date focus on why fossil fuels should be phased out. This study presents the physical requirements in terms of required non-fossil fuel industrial capacity, to completely phase out fossil fuels, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem. The existing industrial ecosystem dependency on fossil fuels was mapped by fuel (oil, gas, and coal) and by industrial application. Data were collected globally for fossil fuel consumption, physical activity, and industrial actions for the year 2018. The estimated sum total of extra annual capacity of non-fossil fuel power generation to phase out fossil fuels completely, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem, at a global scale is 48,939.8 TWh. A discussion on the needed size of the stationary power storage buffer to manage intermittent energy supply from wind and solar was conducted. Pumped hydro, hydrogen, biofuels, and ammonia were all examined as options in this paper. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). An estimate is presented for the total quantity of metals required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal content for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. It was shown that both 2019 global mine production, 2022 global reserve estimates, 2022 mineral resources, and estimates of undersea resources, were manifestly inadequate for meeting projected demand for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and vanadium.” Another second article referenced in the Bulletin is “Quantity of metals required to manufacture one generation of renewable technology units to phase out fossil fuel.” The abstract of that paper states: “An estimate is presented for the total quantity of raw materials required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal con- tent for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities as modelled in a previous study: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). Metal quantities were calculated for all four capacities and compared with mining production, mineral reserves, mineral resources, and known undersea resources. It was also assessed whether recycling could deliver this metal quantity by comparing calculations against the sum total mined metal between 1990 and 2023. The quantity of metal mined over the last 34 years was inadequate, which means recycling cannot deliver the needed capacity, and the mining of minerals would have to be the primary source of metals for at least the first generation of non-fossil fuel technology. If a metal has not yet been mined, then that metal cannot be recycled.” [Boldface added] Caiazza provides a solid analysis of this bulletin and concludes: “This is an ambitious analysis that covers the entire global energy system. As such there are bound to be oversights and limitations as well as interpretative assumptions that could be issues. In my opinion, however, the approach and assumptions are reasonable and should give a reasonable estimate of the metals needed. The mass of metals available is another challenge but I think there is better historical data available. Comparing the metals needed to the metals available leads to the inescapable conclusion that the dreams of replacing fossil fuels will be unable to overcome reality.” [Boldface added] New York State’s Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource remains a pipedream without nuclear or hydropower additions. Both omissions will greatly increase the costs of electricity to consumers in the state. Yet, politicians continue to pretend reliable electricity is not needed.

Writing in The Spectator (UK), Matt Ridely provides a different view. He writes: In the past few years, the Spanish government has been removing dams at a furious rate. Under a European Union program to encourage the restoration of rivers to their wild state for the benefit of fish migration, Spain set about dismantling barriers of all kinds. In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. That year, according to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France. [Boldface added] Some dams were removed in the hills around Valencia but it turns out they were small irrigation dams, not reservoir dams, so they would not have made much difference last week. However, the failure to build a new dam may well be partly to blame. The Cheste dam in the Turia catchment was specifically designed to prevent flooding, to ‘regulate the flows coming from the upper basin of the Poyo and Pozalet ravines. It was approved in 2001 as part of a National Hydrological Plan. Objections from people in Aragon to separate parts of the plan that would transfer water between regions led the socialist Jose Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to promise to repeal it when running for prime minister in 2004. He kept his promise and the Cheste dam was an unintended casualty. Could it have saved Valencia? Possibly. The [capital] city of Aragon was saved last month by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” These extreme weather events have been going on since the time of Emperor Augustus and are not the result of recent “climate change.” Instead, the high death toll is the result of destruction of the resilience provided by dams designed to prevent flooding. A similar failure to build dams recommended by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) near Ashville, NC, probably resulted in the recent flooding there.

The 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has begun in Baku, Azerbaijan, an oil and gas producing country According to reports, in his welcoming speech to the delegates and other attendees, the President of the host country declared oil and gas are gifts of God. The President of COP 29, Azerbaijan’s Mister for Ecology, demanded that climate change be treated with the same urgency as COVID-19 for which “advanced economies marshalled $8 trillion over the course of just 48 months.” Not to be outdone, Jo Nova reports that the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, by far, China, wants $1.3 trillion from wealthy nations. This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030. Meanwhile White House climate adviser John Podesta who is at the conference assured the attendees that the US will move forward in “combating climate change despite the election of President-elect Trump, who has long cast doubt on the science behind the issue.” In December 2023, the US State Department issued a report on the US Climate Finance Pledge which stated: “The United States is committed to exercising U.S. leadership to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement, to accelerate the global clean energy transition, and to enable vulnerable countries and communities to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. To that end, the United States will continue to support developing country partners as they pursue ambitious climate action. The United States has prioritized boosting international climate finance, as well as demanding that international financial institutions evolve to better enable emerging market and developing countries to respond to global challenges, including climate change. That is why President Biden launched the first U.S. International Climate Finance Plan in 2021 and committed to work with Congress to scale up international public climate finance to over $11 billion annually by 2024, quadrupling from the highest previous levels of climate finance provided by the United States.” Apparently, some attendees believe that believe oil and gas are “gifts of God” ignoring them is very costly. Will wealthy countries will continue with the dubious pledges of a few, now irrelevant, politicians? See links under After Paris and Below the Bottom Line. *************** Ignore the Obvious: The director of the Energy, Climate Justice, and Sustainability Lab and a research professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal that exemplifies the approach some academics take about “climate change” and the phony “climate crisis.” In “Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid: With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future” the author ignores that the claim of rising extreme weather events is refuted by physical evidence. Her five approaches are: 1) Better prediction using AI; 2) Better batteries; 3) Independent microgrids; 4) Better, stronger transmission lines; and 5) Controlling demand. One, will AI allow better predictions? Utilities are well aware of the limitations of their equipment. The problem is better weather prediction. Unfortunately, with NOAA weather prediction is ignored in favor of the fantasy of climate prediction. Then there is the problem of chaos beyond two-week predictions. It may be better to just expect the worse and hope it does not happen. Two, better batteries. Storage of electricity has long been a problem for utilities. In 1907 pumped hydro storage was used on a small scale in Switzerland. In 1930 it was used in the US by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company. The largest US facility is the Dominion Electric Bath County, VA, plant. In the summer, the system needs replenishment each weekend from reliable power plants. On the utility scale, batteries remain a dream, not a reality. Three: independent microgrids. This works for hospitals etc. if they provide on-site storage of fuel needed for generation. But microgrids do not work for the general public. As seen in the last major winter storm that brought down the Texas grid, just in time delivery of natural gas does not work. The fuel must be available on site. Wind power failed and promised wind resistant solar panels are of little use at night. Four: better, stronger transmission lines: They are always a goal, but require maintenance. Environmental advocates object to cutting back vegetation to protect the transmission and distribution lines. Five: Controlling demand: This is always the favorite of authoritarians. They, not the public, will decide who will get electricity and when. It may work in an authoritarian state but not in a republic with certain personal rights enshrined in its Constitution. What the author ignores is that wind and solar are unreliable and add to the fragility of the grid making it more subject to disruption in severe weather events. See Article #2 *************** Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago. According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus. Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. Apparently, the Romans knew of the dangers of flooding in eastern Spain over 2,000 years ago. And such flooding is called extreme weather brought on by recent climate change? [That was during the infamous Roman warm period, which was even warmer than the Medieval warm period, which was even warmer than today.] See links under Changing Weather.

Nov 12, 2024 The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 120 scientists, provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies in a fully transparent manner. The 2024 edition (the 19th annual report) will be published in the journal Earth System Science Data on November 13 as a pre-print, and later as a peer-reviewed paper. From the article: For example, India’s emissions, which are projected to be about equal to those of the EU this year, will increase by about 5 percent over their 2023 levels. And the amount of methane and carbon dioxide rising from the rest of the world — which accounts for roughly the same share of global emissions as China and the EU combined — is on track to rise by about 1 percent.

Meanwhile, the NWS is so money-poor it can’t even launch routine weather balloons in all of the locations where needed. Ten million dollars would alleviate that problem.

Plankton are the backbone of the ocean — and may struggle with what’s coming A pair of papers in the journal Nature shows how plankton are struggling to survive in warming seas.

From the article: To assess future impacts of warming waters on plankton, Schmidt and her colleagues turned to ancient changes. The team analyzed an extensive fossil record of a type of plankton called foraminifera, which leave behind tiny shells that fall to the seafloor when they die. Even for those who forgo eating fish, plankton are crucial for preventing climate change from getting even worse than it is. When foraminifera form their shells, they bind carbon with calcium to make their building material. After they die, the shells fall to the seafloor, locking that carbon out of the atmosphere for eons. [SEPP Comment: The assumptions are false.

Litigation Issues Federal Court takes aim at White House’s environment authority By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 13, 2024 On Tuesday, judges with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) cannot issue regulations pertaining to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) — one of the nation’s bedrock environmental laws. Andrew Mergen, an environmental law professor at Harvard, said NEPA is “unique in how sparse it is” meaning that typically, it’s up to administrations to fill in the blanks and tell agencies how these environmental reviews should be conducted. [SEPP Comment: Bureaucrats decide what the law says – a sloppy law.] The climate case of the century By Lucas Bergkamp, Climate Etc., Nov 13, 2024 The Court [Hague Court of Appeal] not only took the IPCC reports as irrebuttable proof, but also attributed normative force to them. For example, the Court ruled that climate scientists have determined that the average temperature on earth may not rise by more than 1.5 degrees. In doing so, the Court, like the Dutch Supreme Court, ignored that science cannot set norms and that scientists are not authorized to set social standards. The Dutch judiciary’s scientistic tendency is extremely worrisome and does not bode well for future climate-related judgments. [SEPP Comment: Although the outcome was good, this practice is sad.

In 2023 alone, these activities generated over $6 billion in federal revenues, with peaks at $17 billion during high activity periods.

Nuclear energy has, in fact, been found to be one of the safest energy sources available. Three Mile Island Unit 1 safely operated until 2019, when it was shut down for economic reasons.

November Wind Slump Has Led To A Strained Energy Supply In Germany…Bottlenecks Threaten By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Nov 13, 2024 The lack of wind power last week led to a tighter energy market in Europe, particularly in central and northern regions and caused a surge in electricity prices, especially in short-term markets. Prices reached a two-year high, exceeding 800 EUR/MWh! As a result, there’s growing concern about the potential for similar price spikes in winter if wind conditions remain weak.

Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future By Amy Myers Jaffe, WSJ, Nov 10, 2024 TWTW Summary: Discussed in the This Week section above. “The recent flooding of Valencia, Spain . . . . In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France.” ________________________________________________________________________________ So far, A total of 2,119 dams have been removed in the U.S. since 1912 and more removals are planned (Google search on “dam removal in the us”) I’m waiting for the article that claims the Climate Change is causing more floods. 2,000 years ago… The sparsely populated areas like the fenland – home to the Iceni etc – underwent huge transformation. “Areas of coastal marshland formed an important and distinctive part of the landscape of Roman Britain, and current work is showing that different wetlands were utilised in very different ways. Some areas, for example in Essex and Kent, were simply exploited for their natural resources to produce salt and support seasonal grazing. Parts of Fenland were also used in this way, though the higher coastal siltlands were modified through the creation of drainage systems in order to improve agricultural opportunities within a landscape that was still liable to tidal flooding. A third strategy towards wetland exploitation is reclamation: a major transformation of the natural environment https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/britannia/article/abs/romanobritish-exploitation-of-coastal-wetlands-survey-and-excavation-on-the-north-somerset-levels-19937/5976A1159AF0585E8CF540D01AD6BD4C The autobahn were built primarily with military purposes in mind. I wonder where they got the idea? Roman roads in Britannia were initially designed for military use, they were constructed by the legions during the four centuries that Britannia was a province of the Roman Empire. Some Roman routes form part of the national road network, today. One has, I think, to reflect a little on a time when things got improved in a major way in a relatively short period of time – albeit under Roman occupation – because we are now in a period where things are going into reverse. And deliberately so. The Romans would hold games – somewhat barbaric by ‘today’s standards’ – to entertain the masses. “”“While gladiators have always captured the public imagination, their presence in Britain has been less widely understood. New research has now proven that the spectacles of Rome’s Colosseum were experienced as far away as Colchester.”” https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/Gladiators-of-Britain.pdf The current elites feed us a constant diet of doom and gloom throughout the spheres “”I’ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal? … The Doomsday Clock is now set at 90 seconds to midnight. Its operators, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who monitor the combined risks of nuclear annihilation, climate disaster, biological threat and “disruptive technologies”, say we have never been closer to global catastrophic destruction. I’m finally into ‘prepping’ and ready for the apocalypse https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/17/im-finally-into-prepping-and-ready-for-the-apocalypse What will Miliband do for us? To recap… The following SEPP comment is silly on a couple of counts. “There is no explanation on how the heavy CFC molecules get from the surface to the stratosphere. (CCI2F2 [Freon] has an atomic weight of about 121 atomic mass units (amu)).” Gases fill the volume of their container basically due to entropy. Refrigerants are gases. Less volatile gases will migrate (diffuse) more slowly, but mixing occurs in the atmosphere due to winds, thermals, etc. “Atomic” refers to atoms, “molecular” refers to molecules. The molecular weight of a Freon is the sum of its atomic constituents. “According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” The ancients had good engineers. My uncle was in southern Iraq during WWII. He said he drove his jeep over a stone bridge- a sign next to it said it was built by Alexander the Great! So, why do you think NPR published this bit of news? When will greenhouse gas emissions finally peak? Could be soon “For almost two centuries, greenhouse gas emissions have climbed steadily as humans have burned increasing amounts of oil, gas and coal. Now, climate scientists believe those emissions may finally be reaching a peak…” No time to follow the link yet but I’m guessing its a combo of technologically driven energy efficiency increases, economically driven population growth decreases and wishful thinking. As to why they’d publish a “don’t worry” piece, I think they see the writing on the wall. It’s over? The current temperature spike is about over, so there’s certainly an opportunity to take credit — even is none is due. Okay started reading it… “Studies show emissions must peak and then rapidly decline to limit impacts like more intense heat waves and storms.” Stopped there. “more intense heat waves and storms” Goebbels would be proud of the Climate Fascists. “This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030.” I think above words were written intending to be ironic but “Neil Armstrong famously said, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” on July 20, 1969, as he became the first person to walk on the moon” That was 55 years ago. The famous American astronaut has been dead for about 8 years. American businessmen have gone to space, because, why not? Going to the moon was a technology goal for days gone by, and now that most people believe it really happened 5 decades ago, the natural response would not be “wow!” but rather “why?” Pushing a rope uphill. https://www.reuters.com/technology/northvolt-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-us-2024-11-21/ Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: A stronger Ozempic is coming. What to know about CagriSema, Novo Nordisk's new weight loss drug
URL: https://qz.com/cagrisema-ozempic-weight-loss-drug-novo-nordisk-1851696433
Time Published: 2024-11-18T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.77%) — the company credited with ushering in the current weight-loss drug revolution when it launched its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic in 2017 — is working on its next act, a weight-loss drug called CagriSema Ozempic works by mimicking a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. In recent years, it has become highly sought after for its slimming side effects. In response, the Danish pharma giant in 2021 introduced a higher-dose version of Ozempic’s active ingredient, semaglutide, for the specific purpose of weight loss. Since then, demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.14%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.15%) analysts anticipate the global market for these highly coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company that started it all is working on a sequel: Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema is an experimental drug being developed by Novo Nordisk. It is currently undergoing late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The active ingredient of Ozempic and Wegovy is semaglutide, which is known as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RAs). That means it works by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1, which promotes the production of insulin, regulates blood sugar levels, slows the emptying of the stomach, and affects the area of the brain that controls satiety. CagriSema combines semaglutide with a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist called cagrilintide — hence the name CagriSema. In addition to mimicking GLP-1, CagriSema mimics two other gut hormones. The first is amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas. Amylin works a lot like GLP-1 by regulating blood sugar levels, slowing the emptying of the gastrointestinal tract, and promoting satiety. CagriSema also mimics calcitonin, a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose an average of 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange recently told analysts he has “confidence” that the larger trials of the drug will show that CagriSema could help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials, including studies that tested cagrilintide on its own, to arrive at this figure. Novo Nordisk is expected to release results for its two phase 3 trials of CagriSema later this year and in the first half of 2025. Depending on the outcome of the results, Novo Nordisk could soon file regulatory applications with health agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Reviews of these application can take up to a year. In the meantime, Novo Nordisk will be working to make sure they are able to produce enough supply to meet anticipated demand for the new drug. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been struggling to produce enough of their current weight-loss drugs to meet skyrocketing demand. The pharma giants have since both invested billions to ramp up their manufacturing capacity. If everything goes according to plan, Novo Nordisk could launch CagriSema in the United States and Europe in late 2025 or early 2026.

Title: Nvidia earnings are this week. Here's what Wall Street expects
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-q3-2024-earnings-ai-chips-blackwell-1851699350
Time Published: 2024-11-18T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA-3.10%) plans to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet. Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia reported revenues of $30 billion for the second fiscal quarter. The company’s shares are up 204.7% so far this year. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations with its second-quarter results, the company’s shares fell during after-hours trading and into the morning due to unimpressed investors who sought higher revenue guidance. Nvidia set third-quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — above the average that analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. “The market was clearly hoping for another blowout where expectations were pushed up yet again,” Richard Windsor, founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. However, Windsor said “Nvidia has much better visibility than it is implying,” and said he expects around $34 billion for the third quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia again became the most valuable public company in the world after its shares rose, pushing its market cap past Apple’s (AAPL+0.48%). The chipmaker recently announced that Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.36%) will be the first customer to receive its highly anticipated Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. SoftBank plans to build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia’s technology. In October, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company had fixed a design flaw that caused delays with producing and shipping Blackwell. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.35%) to resolve the engineering setback, Huang said. In August, Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report said Blackwell’s production was delayed due to the flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL-1.84%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%).

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell rack design reportedly faces overheating, potentially delaying shipments
URL: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241118PD217/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-design-shipments.html
Time Published: 2024-11-18T08:58:50Z

Credit: Bloomberg Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs, already delayed to market, are reportedly facing severe overheating issues in high-capacity server racks, raising concerns over deployment timelines. Nvidia has requested suppliers to revise rack designs as concerns mount among data center operators over delayed Blackwell shipments amid AI accelerator shortages. Overheating issues for Nvidia's high-power NVL72 racks Bloomberg, Reuters, and Tom's Hardware, citing The Information, report that Nvidia's NVL72 racks—housing up to 72 Blackwell chips for AI and HPC—face severe overheating issues. These racks consume 120 kW per unit, risking performance degradation and hardware damage. The NVL72 rack, featuring 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs, weighs 1.5 tons and consumes up to 132 kW—setting a record for single-server power usage, Businesskorea reports. The overheating problem has reportedly raised customer concerns over disruptions to next-generation AI data center deployments. Nvidia employees, suppliers, and customers have confirmed the issue. Nvidia has requested design changes from suppliers but has not disclosed the names involved. Nvidia downplayed the issue. "Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process," an Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters. "The engineering iterations are normal and expected." Blackwell delays: Challenges for Nvidia's 2025 prospects Announced in March 2024 as the successor to the H100 GPUs, Blackwell promises 30x performance gains and up to 25% energy savings on select workloads. Originally set for shipment in late 2024, Blackwell's launch was delayed to early 2025 due to design flaws. These setbacks could disrupt AI data center plans for key clients like Meta, Google, and Microsoft while challenging Nvidia's AI hardware dominance. Analysts stress that Blackwell's success is vital to Nvidia's market leadership, with technical fixes and timely delivery being top priorities. This has led some Wall Street firms to take a more cautious view of Nvidia's 2025 outlook. Wccftech reports that Morgan Stanley initially projected Nvidia would ship up to 450,000 Blackwell GPUs in the fourth quarter of 2024, rising to 700,000–800,000 units in the first quarter of 2025. Raymond James, however, has revised its fourth-quarter estimate to just 100,000 units but remains optimistic about 2025, anticipating strong full-year demand for Blackwell GPUs. The investment bank Jefferies has cautioned that despite Nvidia's strong recent performance, market expectations for its future revenue and profit might be overly ambitious. The bank estimates Nvidia will ship around 6 million GPUs in 2025, below market forecasts. It also projects data center revenue of US$180 billion to US$200 billion, lower than the market average of US$205 billion to US$215 billion. Financial risks amid Blackwell's uncertainty It is still unclear if overheating issues will delay Blackwell's early 2025 launch, but Nvidia has significant stakes in getting it right. Each GB200 Grace Blackwell superchip costs up to US$70,000, while a complete server rack exceeds US$3 million. Nvidia aims to sell 60,000–70,000 servers, making further delays costly for a company now among the world's most valuable due to its dominance in AI. SiliconANGLE cites Holger Mueller of Constellation Research, who stresses that cooling is vital for AI platforms as high-powered chips risk damage at elevated temperatures. Nvidia has acknowledged the issue but has not clarified its severity. "The questions are how expensive will this be to fix, and how long will it take?" Mueller said. "Blackwell is by far the most compelling platform for generative AI, so customers have no choice but to sit tight and wait for a fix. The duration of that wait will determine if there's any impact on Nvidia's sky-high stock price." Mueller added that Blackwell remains the most compelling generative AI platform, leaving customers no choice but to wait. The length of that wait could affect Nvidia's stock price.

This will relieve buyers in India. We are amid a wedding season, and gold buying is key to wedding celebrations. Gold prices are falling largely due to the rising inflation in the US that has dimmed hopes of a rate cut by the US Fed. Gold prices tend to rise in a low interest rate regime, hopes of a rate cut fading and a rising US Dollar is keeping prices lower. The rising US Dollar makes buying gold more expensive, thereby impacting demand. The fall in the price of gold in India has put it on par with key global markets. The prices in key Middle-East countries are elevated due to the rising geopolitical tensions between Israel, Palestine, Iran, and Ukraine, Russia. Gold prices are expected to trade at current levels in the short to medium term. Prices will eventually recover to their recent highs as geopolitical tensions fade, and interest rates are softened by the US Fed and the RBI in the first half of CY25.” Nippon India Mutual Fund has launched two new passive funds on Nifty auto and realty indices.

On data front, U.S. retail sales increased slightly more than expected in October, highlighting the economy’s resilience. US headline inflation also was reported better than expectations at 2.6% raising questions over Fed’s rate cut stance ahead.

The decline was primarily attributed to a drop in Foreign Currency Assets, while gold reserves saw an increase. Despite this dip, India maintains its position as the fourth largest holder of foreign exchange reserves globally. 2)India’s retail inflation accelerated to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent on an annual basis in October, quickening from 5.49 per cent in the previous month and breaching the central bank’s tolerance ceiling, primarily driven by persisting high food prices. Food inflation, which makes up around half of the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, surged to 10.87 per cent in October, up from 9.24 percent in the previous month. Rural inflation also quickened to 6.68 per cent, compared to 5.87 per cent in September, while urban inflation rose to 5.62 per cent from 5.05 per cent the previous month 3)India’s industrial output rebounded in September, growing 3.1%, after contracting 0.1% in August - a 22-month low - driven by a favourable base effect and pre-festive season stocking that boosted manufacturing, official data released on Tuesday showed. For the quarter ending September, IIP growth was at a seven-quarter low of 2.6% due to high base effect and weather vagaries. The growth was 4% in the first half of the current financial year, down from 6.2% in the corresponding period last year. 4)India’s Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation increased in October to a four-month high of 2.36 per cent from 1.84 per cent in September, primarily on the back of a spike in the prices of food items, particularly vegetables. Inflation in wholesale food prices increased to 13.54 per cent during the month. 5)India’s merchandise exports in Oct rose by an impressive 17.3%, highest in over two years, to $39.2 billion, while the trade deficit widened to $27.1 billion. According to govt data released on Thursday, imports increased by 3.9% to $66.3 billion in Oct compared to $63.9 billion in the year-ago period. A key highlight is the performance of non-petroleum and non-gems exports, a crucial indicator of India’s manufacturing health. These exports jumped 27.7% to $31.36 billion in October. The trade deficit (gap between imports and exports) narrowed as compared to $30.4 billion recorded in Oct last year. 6)India’s outward FDI commitments rose to $3.24 billion in October 2024, compared to $2.55 billion in October 2023 but declined from $3.77 billion in September 2024, according to RBI data. Equity commitments stood at $655.84 million in October 2024, down from $993.35 million a year earlier and $817.64 million in the previous month. Debt commitments surged to $1.24 billion, significantly higher than $248.4 million in October 2023 and $1.16 billion in September 2024. Guarantees remained steady at $1.33 billion in October 2024, compared to $1.31 billion a year ago, but were lower than $1.79 billion in September 2024. Outbound FDI includes equity, loans, and guarantees. 7)India’s merchandise exports are likely to grow 1.85% year-on-year to $107.5 billion in the third quarter of FY25, led by sustained momentum in economic activity and improving demand prospects in trading partners supported by expected global monetary easing, India Exim Bank said on Tuesday. Non-oil exports are forecast to grow 7.39% a year to $91.7 billion, while non-oil and non-gems and jewellery exports are forecast to amount $82.7 billion, with 7.8% growth. 8)India’s net direct tax collection grew 15.4 per cent year on year to Rs 12.1 lakh crore during the period April 1-November 10. Direct taxes include corporate and personal tax. It grew over 21 per cent to Rs 15 lakh crore, up 21.20 per cent, on a gross basis during the period, a statement issued by the income tax department said. This includes net corporate tax of Rs 5.10 lakh crore and non-corporate taxes of Rs 6.62 lakh crore. Other taxes worth Rs 35,923 crore were mopped up. 9)India’s Securities Transaction Tax (STT) collection has surged to ₹36,000 crore between April and November 2024, nearing 97% of the current fiscal year’s budget estimate of ₹37,000 crore. 10)Foreigners have sold 82.1 billion rupees ($973 million) of Indian government bonds, which are part of the JPMorgan index, so far in November, according to clearing house data on Thursday. A rise in U.S. yields along with a stronger dollar have driven the selling, traders and analysts said. 11)To facilitate ease of onboarding of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and reduce duplication, SEBI will allow FPI applicants to fill either a full Common Application Form (CAF) or an abridged version with pre-filled data from the depository system, effective three months from the circular date. Applicants must consent to use and verify the accuracy of the pre-filled data, with updates allowed as needed. This aims to streamline the process, especially for FPIs like sub-funds or schemes under Investment Managers, whose information is already in the CAF module. 12)RBI and SEBI have introduced a framework allowing Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to reclassify their investments as Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) once they exceed the 10% ownership threshold in an Indian company. This offers FPIs the choice to either divest or reclassify their holdings, with necessary approvals. The reclassified investments will remain FDI even if the ownership falls below 10%. This change is expected to encourage foreign investments, especially in startups and mid-cap firms, while introducing tax obligations and approval timelines 13)Indian corporates, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), filed proposals in September 2024 to raise $4.84 billion through External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), according to RBI data. Of the total, $3.77 billion is planned via the automatic route, while $1.06 billion is sought through the approval route. This highlights the continued reliance on ECBs for funding amid evolving market conditions. 14)Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOSL) reported that the total number of demat accounts in India reached 179 million as of October 2024. However, new account additions experienced a dip, with 3.5 million accounts added in October 2024 compared to the average monthly additions of 3.9 million year-to-date for FY25. 15)The monthly mutual fund SIP crossed the Rs 25,000 crore mark for the first time in October and stood at Rs 25,323 crore against Rs 24,509 crore in September. The mutual fund folios were at all-time highs of 21,65,02,804 in October. The retail mutual fund folios, which include equity, hybrid, and solution-oriented schemes, were also at an all-time high at 17,23,52,296 for October as compared to 16,81,61,366 for September. 16)Moody’s Ratings on Friday forecast a 7.2 per cent GDP growth for India in 2024, saying the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, but inflation risks may prompt the RBI to retain a relatively tight monetary policy this year. Moody’s said that despite the near-term uptick, retail inflation should moderate toward the Reserve Bank’s target in the coming months as food prices ease amid higher sowing and adequate food grain buffer stocks. 17)The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation witnessed a 7.6% jump in number of contributing members in 2023-24 at 73.7million compared to 68.5 million in the preceding years while the number of contributing establishments went up by 6.6% to 0.76 million as against 0.71 million in 2022-23, shows the draft annual report of EPFO for 2023-24. 18)India’s bilateral trade with China stood at $10.7 billion during October, witnessing 0.46 per cent contraction amid a slowdown in the neighbouring country, commerce department data showed. The contraction was mainly driven by exports as outbound shipments to China contracted 9.5 per cent at $1.15 billion, even as India’s overall exports bounced back in October and saw a double-digit growth of 17 per cent. 19)State Bank of India (SBI) has increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points in three tenors – three months, six months and one year. With effect from November 15, the MCLR for three months and six months will be 8.55 per cent (8.50 per cent earlier) and 8.90 per cent (8.85 per cent), respectively. WORLD 1)In a monthly report on Tuesday, OPEC revised its global oil demand growth forecasts downward for 2024 and 2025, citing weaker demand in China, India, and other regions. The 2024 growth estimate was reduced to 1.82 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.93 million bpd in October, marking the fourth consecutive downgrade. The 2025 forecast was cut to 1.54 million bpd from 1.64 million bpd. 2)In his recent speech, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the U.S. economy does not indicate an immediate need to lower interest rates, reaffirming the Fed’s commitment to achieving a 2% inflation target. Powell highlighted strong economic performance, a solid labor market, and the gradual normalization of housing services inflation. The Fed projects core PCE inflation to rise to 2.8% in October from 2.7% in September. He emphasized a cautious approach to policy adjustments and reiterated the Fed’s apolitical stance, stating that decisions are not influenced by political considerations. Powell also noted the Fed’s preparation to use emergency tools in case of financial instability. 3)America’s national debt has surpassed $36 trillion for the first time in its history, the US Debt Clock – a website monitoring the nation’s finances in real time reported on Friday. The figure grew by nearly 6% from January to November, increasing by $1 trillion in less than four months. In late July, the US Treasury announced that it had surpassed $35 trillion. 4)The US consumer price index increased to 315.66 points in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which increased from 315.30 points in September. 5)Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 223,000 claims for the latest week. 6)The annual inflation rate in the US accelerated to 2.6% in October 2024, up from 2.4% in September which was the lowest rate since February 2021, marking the first increase in inflation in seven months. On a monthly basis, CPI rose by 0.2%, consistent with the previous three months. The annual core consumer price inflation rate stood at a three-month high of 3.3%, unchanged from the previous month. 7)The US producer price index for final demand rose 0.2% in October after an upwardly revised 0.1% gain in September, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.2% following a previously reported unchanged reading in September. 8)October retail sales grew from the prior month, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October. Economists had expected a 0.3% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in September were revised up to a 0.8% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Auto sales drove a majority of the gains in October’s reading, with sales in the sector rising 1.6%. 9)The U.S. budget deficit jumped nearly four-fold to $257 billion in October, a figure inflated by one-off factors, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday in a report that started off a new fiscal year with a big hole to be turned over to President-elect Donald Trump in January. The Treasury said the October deficit was up 287% from the $67 billion deficit in October 2023, but calendar adjustments in benefit payments had cut that month’s deficit nearly in half. 10)In November, the ZEW Economic Sentiment Index for the eurozone declined from 20.1 points in October to 12.5, missing the market’s expected figure of 20.1. Similarly, views on the eurozone’s current situation fell, with the index decreasing by 3.0 points to -43.8. 11)In September 2024, the Eurozone’s industrial production decreased by 2.8% year-on-year (YoY), compared to the same month in 2023. This was more than the 2.0% drop that economist had predicted. 12)In the third quarter of 2024, seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 0.4%8 in the euro area and by 0.3% the EU, compared with the previous quarter, according to a flash estimate published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The employment *increased by 1.0% in the euro area and by 0.8% in the EU in the third quarter of 2024, after +0.9% in both areas in the second quarter of 2024. 13)The United Kingdom’s (UK) ILO Unemployment Rate ticked up to 4.3% in the three months to September, following 4.0% in August, the data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Tuesday. The market expected a 4.1% reading in the reported period. 14)In September 2024, the UK’s trade deficit widened to £3.46 billion, up from £2.02 billion in August. Goods imports fell by £3.0 billion (6.3%), with declines in both EU and non-EU imports, while goods exports dropped by 5.8% to a 28-month low of £68.20 billion. Services imports rose slightly by £0.2 billion (0.8%), whereas services exports declined by £0.1 billion (0.3%), contributing to the overall trade imbalance. 15)UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by 0.1% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2024, following growth of 0.5% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2024. GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.0% in Quarter 3 2024, compared with the same quarter a year ago. 16)Industrial Production in the UK Decreased by 0.5% (MoM) in September. Monthly production output was estimated to have decreased by 0.5% in September 2024; this follows a decrease of 0.7% in July 2024 and an increase of 0.5% in August 2024. 17)Manufacturing Production in the United Kingdom decreased 0.70 percent in September of 2024 over the same month in the previous year. Manufacturing Production in the United Kingdom averaged 1.86 percent from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 35.50 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -20.50 percent in April of 2020 18)The Bank of Japan said on Wednesday the preliminary Producer Price Index rose 3.4 percent from the same month last year. That compares to a 3.1 percent increase in September. The costs of goods traded between companies in Japan were up in October. This was due mainly to higher prices of rice and copper. Monthly, producer prices rose by 0.2%, beating consensus of a flat reading and following an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in September. 19)Japan’s economy expanded by an annualized 0.9% over the July-September quarter, government data showed on Friday, slowing from the previous three months due to tepid capital spending though an unexpected pickup in consumption added a bright spot. 20)Industrial Production in China increased 5.30 percent in October of 2024 over the same month in the previous year. Industrial Production in China averaged 11.04 percent from 1990 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 35.10 percent in January of 2021 and a record low of -21.10 percent in January of 1990. The Indian CGD sector outlook has become murkier with further APM gas allocation cut by the Government/nodal agency (GAIL). IGL/MGL has reported 20%/18% additional cuts wef 16-Nov on top of the ~20% cut earlier on 16-Oct, while Adani Total Gas (not rated) has indicated a 13% cut. While structural decline in APM allocation for the CGD sector is inevitable, the significant ~35% cut in the last one month with no proper policy communication is a negative. CGD companies highlighted post-Q2FY25 that the October cut was a major one with gradual cuts likely hereon and that prices would be hiked post-festive season to partially recover lost margins. However, no action has been seen so far and with this additional cut, the margin outlook has deteriorated with no near-term clarity on the course of action. Media reports quoting MOPNG officials have stated GoI asking for cost breakup, highlighting the high margins of CGDs vs OMCs, before green signaling them for retail price hikes (at least Rs4.5-5/kg required), which could add to negative sentiments. In the absence of price hikes, we estimate a 46%/25% hit on IGL/MGL’s EBITDA/scm vs Q2 run-rate which is Rs3.5/8 and against the latest guidance of Rs6-7/10-12, and our earlier estimate of Rs6.7-6.9/10.5-10.8. Excise duty alignment between CNG, petrol and diesel can be done to avoid CNG price hikes amid a USD70-75/bbl oil price scenario, if the current margins and return ratios of CGDs are to be protected. Due to the lack of clarity, we now assume a 14% RoE model for both IGL/MGL (in line with original open access regulations) vs 17%/18% earlier estimated for FY26-27E and cut our SA EPS by 17%/25%. Our TP for IGL/MGL reduces 18%/26% to Rs385/1,400 and we downgrade IGL/MGL to REDUCE/ADD from Add/Buy earlier. We await further commentary from companies and GoI to assume a less conservative scenario. IGL is currently trading at 2.3-2.6x FY25-26E adjusted P/B and MGL at 1.7-1.8x, which at 14% sustainable RoE and potential 7-10% volume growth seems reasonable.

The outlook for Zomato is bullish. The stock has surged over 8 per cent last week. This marks the end of the corrective fall that was in place since the last week of September this year. It also indicates that a new leg of upmove has begun. Moving average cross overs on the daily chart also strengthens the bullish case. Immediate support is at ₹263. Below that ₹255-₹250 is a very strong support zone. Zomato share price can rise to ₹300-₹310 in the coming weeks. The fall last week in the benchmark indices were more in line with our expectation. There is some support near current levels. So, the chance of a corrective bounce in the near term is a possibility. However, the trend is still down and so the upside is likely to be capped. Sensex, Nifty and the Nifty Bank index have room to fall more from here. But from a long-term perspective, the fall from here could be the last leg of this correction.

Fuel gauge's red needle indicating empty gas tank o The whipsaw action in the stock market over the past two weeks likely has some investors looking for a personal injury attorney. The strong buying after the election results confirmed the bullish intermediate trend for stock prices as the fear of missing out (FOMO) seemed to be the dominant sentiment. According to last week’s survey from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), the bullish % rose to 49.8% from 41.5% the prior month as the neutral camp dropped from 30.9% to 21.8%. It was interesting that the bearish % rose slightly to 28.3% from the prior reading of 27.6%. This week’s numbers will be interesting. As last week progressed and proposed cabinet members were announced the sentiment seemed to shift to one of fear as nervous investors or traders tried to hypothesize what could happen to various stocks, sectors or the economy in 2025 if the promised plans were actually implemented. The selling on Friday was led by tech shares as the six widely followed most valuable tech shares including Apple, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft lost $458 billion. Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday. Markets For the week the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) were the weakest down 4.6% despite the inflationary fears of some economists. The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) lost 4.1%. The Nadaq 100 Index dropped 3.4% which was 1.3% more than the S&P 500’s loss of 2.1%. The Dow Jones Utility Average was able to gain 0.2%. Even as the week started the high-margin debt, price-to-sales ratio and Bloomberg Intelligence noted that apparently, analysts are scaling back their forecasts for “earning growth over the next year.” Something they call earning-revision-momentum “has slumped to negative territory.” This is apparently based on analysts' expectations for future earnings from the company report or their commentary. This in my view is very soft data. The negative earnings forecasts in both 2023 and 2024 kept many out of the stock market. In the current quarter, S&P 500 profits are expected to be 8.5% higher, double the estimate at the start of the earnings season. The hard data numbers from last week’s trading were not as negative as some of the price action since on the NYSE there were 803 advancing issues and 2066 declining. But on Friday’s plunge, only 27% of the S&P 500 stocks closed lower while 78% were higher on November 5th. The NDX 100 numbers were more negative as 80% were down Friday with 70% higher on the 5th. There has been some weakening in both the weekly and daily advance/decline lines. However, at this point is not a sign that the bull market is ending or that a bear market is imminent. Over the next few weeks, it may have more implications for traders than investors. SPY Weekly The weekly SPY decline did overlap about 50% of the prior week’s range but that does not complete a classic top formation. The 20-week EMA is rising strongly at $552.33 and it would be expected to be flattening or declining if a significant top was being formed. The QPivot is at $552.91 and a weekly close below this level would be more negative. The September lows are in the $540 area. The S&P 500 Advance/Decline made a new high the week of October 18th and did not make a new high the week of the election. Therefore a bearish divergence has been formed but a drop below the prior low is needed to confirm the divergence. A close below its WMA will indicate that the S&P 500 is ready to move sideways to lower as we head into the end of the year. If the selling does not increase this week then the market is likely to hold the pre-election lows before turning higher. In my experience, the major trend of the stock market is like a supertanker as it takes time to change direction. Bouts of heavy selling on future expectations or concerns in a bull market are frequently later acknowledged as just corrections in the major. Brexit Decline Some of you may remember how the stock market reacted to the Brexit referendum in June 2023 as the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. There was a panic decline for two days that dropped the S&P 5.7% as there was wild conjecture about what it might do to the EU as well as the world economy. Just eight days later the S&P had rallied to a new high as investors realized that the impact of the vote could not be a reality until the next year. The current situation shares some similarities as if the proposed cabinet members take over their departments in early 2025 their new policy will take time to be implemented. Any future changes for a company like General Dynamics (GD) that had revenue and net income growth of over 10% in its last report did not seem to warrant last week's 7% decline. I think investors who were not panicked into selling last week in reaction to the worst-case scenarios may start to consider buying. SPY Daily This does not mean that investors or traders can ignore some of last week’s warning signs. I employ a version of the weight of the evidence approach that I learned from Stan Weinstein, a legendary technical analyst, who also developed stage analysis. The daily chart of SPY has major support in the $563 area, line a, and the July high. The chart includes both the daily S&P 500 A/D line as well as the NYSE All A/D line that covers all issues traded on the NYSE. Both A/D lines have been in solid uptrend for most of the year but both made new highs on October 18th before correcting ahead of the election. The S&P 500 held above the early October lows before moving sharply higher in reaction to the election. The A/D numbers post-election were not strong enough to take the A/D lines above the prior highs. The S&P 500 Advance/Decline line failed to make a new high on November 11th and then dropped back below its EMA. This created a negative or bearish divergence, line b. This would be confirmed by a decline below the recent lows as that would start a new downtrend (lower high and lower lows) There is longer-term support at line c. The NYSE All A/D line shows a similar negative divergence, line d, even though it has different components. The late October lows in the NYSE All A/D line were a bit lower which is a negative sign that favors further weakness. Included in my weight of the evidence is also the NYSE Stocks Only advance/decline line as well as those for the Russell 2000, Dow Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100. This tech-heavy index is tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) which has been a leader for much of the bull market. Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ did close Friday below the mid-point of the prior weekly bar at $499 with the positively rising 20-week EMA at $481.43. The weekly starc- band is at $459.57. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line did make a new high a week ago so no divergences were formed. It is still in a weekly uptrend and above its WMA. The A/D line staged an upside breakout in September, line b, which was a sign of strength. The extent of the current decline may depend on the bond market which will be the focus of a new article this week. The extent of some declines last week reinforces the necessity of using stops on all trading positions. I use wider stops on existing investment positions. Those who are concerned about any trading positions after last week I would consider using stops under the most recent low if the market moves higher early in the week. A violation of last week’s lows after a bounce will increase the odds of further selling. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Banks are grappling with a scam ‘crisis’ while Facebook profits from it

The CEOs of two major New Zealand banks say Facebook is rife with fraud – and that Meta is too busy making money from scam ads to try and stop them. Duncan Greive reports. The story would have been dystopian a few years ago, but is now routine, almost unremarkable. A pensioner sees an advertisement starring prime minister Chris Luxon, encouraging investment in cryptocurrency. Within weeks she transfers over $200,000 through a series of accounts and exchanges. Only too late realising she’s been caught by sophisticated scammers, and that the money will never return. It ran on the cover of the Herald on Sunday on October 20. The victim’s name is Jill Creasy, a Taranaki grandmother. The story was broken by Lane Nichols, who has spent much of the last year detailing the excruciating impacts of the scam economy. Creasy told Nichols, “first of all I felt angry and then I felt foolish, then I felt really ashamed.” The story mentions TSB, her bank, nine times. It mentions Facebook, the platform where it all began, just once. This is a microcosm of how we view the issue as a country – it’s a problem for the person being defrauded, and for their bank. For Facebook, which ran the ads in question, it’s a profit centre. Running scams on Facebook featuring a fake celebrity has been a huge business for years – in 2018, it was often Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbeg himself with the favoured currency iTunes gift cards. Now it’s most often Elon Musk and crypto. As Dylan Reeve reported for The Spinoff in August, the decaying but still widely used platform seems to make no real effort to pull down scam ads, even when users make repeated attempts to inform the company of its dangerous, fraudulent and defamatory advertising. Reeve details dozens of attempts to report clear scams, featuring impersonations of celebrities and news sites, only to be told “the page doesn’t go against our Community Standards”. This goes for regular users, but also for banks, at least one of which spent months reporting a scam ad featuring its logo, ultimately giving up due to a lack of response from Facebook. It’s part of a vast scam ecosystem running in New Zealand, one which the government’s New Zealand Cyber Security Centre estimates costs us $3.8m per week, close to $200m per year. The rise of deepfakes, and the way generative AI has made technology far more accessible to scammers, has seen a sharp rise in both the volume and sophistication of scams. These range from simple Facebook Marketplace fraud, to elaborate cons run from offshore. And because Facebook is a place all major corporations and government departments show up for everything from advertising to customer experience, many users have trouble distinguishing advertising and legitimate communication from scammers. Those running banks in New Zealand don’t dispute that they have a crucial role to play in stopping scams. They say they have doubled investment, and introduced significant new controls and reporting channels which have helped prevent the problem from growing further. But they feel strongly that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is completely indifferent to the harm it’s visiting upon its own users and the banks’ customers. Their statements are unusually strong, for the normally mild language of corporations – particularly those which interact with one another, on advertising or as bank clients, every day. “For a company that’s amongst the most valuable in the world, with an absolute black belt in creating algorithms that drive behaviour, I cannot for life of me understand how Meta wouldn’t be able to be amongst the most effective at blocking this type of thing,” says Kiwibank CEO Steve Jurkovich. Meta makes enormous investments in AR, VR and AI – yet banks say they cannot get a response from Meta, and claim no substantive engagement on solving scams. Westpac CEO Catherine McGrath concurs. “They’re making money out of placing the fake ads, and with all the tools and expertise and cash that they’ve got, they’re not responding to try and find the needle in a haystack. To say, ‘how do we immediately close that down?’” Meta refused to be interviewed for this story, but provided a statement. “The safety of our users is of utmost importance. We continue to invest in new ways to stop scammers and deepen our collaborative efforts with industry partners including the banks, the government and law enforcement on this important issue.” (Both CEOs I spoke to strongly reject this characterisation – they describe the relationship as essentially non-existent.) Meta also provided various information around its efforts to prevent scams, including that it is testing new technology to detect when public figures are used in advertising, though that clearly has arrived too late for many victims. It says that advertisers now “may be asked” to provide a phone number before placing an ad. The Meta spokesperson noted that it has invested US$20bn in “teams and technology to enhance safety”. It’s a large figure, but less impressive in context – since 2021, Meta has spent more than twice as much on creating its largely unused “metaverse”, and over US$90bn on stock buybacks, designed to inflate its share price. Its ability to spend on engineering to counter scams is essentially limitless – Meta’s sales increased 19% year-on-year, but profits leapt by 35% over the same period, to US$15bn for its most recent quarter. What the bank CEOs are saying is that failure to fix the issue is a choice. And that while their profits are highly scrutinised, they are dwarfed by those of Meta. To this point, there has been little pressure on Facebook for its role in the scam chain. When a customer is defrauded, news media, politicians, agencies and the public typically focus on the banks. (This is starting to change in news media – recently Nichols diligently interrogated Facebook’s role in a follow up to the original story about Creasy’s losses.) Politicians remain fixated on banks. Consumer affairs minister Andrew Bayly has largely targeted them during his first year in the portfolio. He has been withering in his criticism and firm in his expectations that they do more to prevent fraud. He wrote an open letter earlier this year, urging them “to take immediate and concerted action to enhance your processes and protections to better safeguard your customers from scams and fraud.” The banks, fighting negative publicity on multiple fronts, have heard the message, says Jurkovich. Bayly says one of his requests – confirmation of payee, which matches account holder’s name to the account number – is now being rolled out, and should be system-wide by Easter (a representative for the Banking Association says this was already in motion when Bayly made his request). Jurkovich says the big banks’ leadership now meets weekly to share information about scams, and has made significant progress over the past year, with more attempts but lower losses as a result – Westpac says it recovers $9 for every $10 either stolen or attempted. All this has come at a significant cost, according to Jurkovich. “[Kiwibank has] tripled our investment to try and lift our capabilities, from what I think were pretty good, to trying to be much better. Because, of course, the threat has gone up heaps… In terms of the dollars involved across the industry, I’ll be amazed if they haven’t doubled in the last six to 12 months.” McGrath talks about fraud and scams in terms of an on ramp and an off ramp – in business terms, you might call it the difference between lead generation and sales. “How do customers get entangled in the first place? The on ramp would tend to be social media. It could be coming through your phone in terms of text. Less often now it’s somebody approaching you in person, because we’re all quite leery about somebody doing something like that. “Banks, in my view, are the off ramp. with a payment mechanism and payment rails. The banks are doing a massive amount of work to try and find the needle in the haystack out of the millions of payments that we make every day.” What is the equivalent work being done on the social media side? It’s “almost nonexistent”, says McGrath. The CEOs of major banks are not typically sympathetic characters within New Zealand. There is currently an inquiry into banking competition before the finance select committee, in part due to record profits which seem almost impervious to the economic cycle. The AFR reported that the big four Australian-owned banks generated $7.4bn in profits last financial year, for a return on equity of 13.4% – making ours by some measures amongst the most profitable banking sectors in the world. Investment banker Andrew Body typifies the view of some that the banks are regulated into extreme conservatism and avoidance of true competition, describing the sector as an “oligopoly” mired in “stasis”. The thesis is that the status quo reduces the kind of risk tolerant lending our business sector needs, and slows the advance of competition through the likes of open banking. The fact the CEOs mention that open banking competitors would struggle to match their investment in scam detection might back up the view that they are resistant to more competition. Banks are also hardly blameless in the scam ecosystem. Nichols’ superb reporting for the NZ Herald has revealed eye-watering failures from banks, including a Westpac customer who lost $200,000 after being wrongly assured an account was in his name, and a Kiwibank customer who lost $300,000 months after an FMA warning about this type of scam. All the major banks have experienced failures of process which have seen victims lose massive sums. Given they make enormous profits, their patchy record on reimbursement makes their claims to be victims too hard to square. Still, the reason we have so much knowledge and visibility of banks’ business is that banking is one of the most regulated activities in New Zealand. Banks are overseen by the Reserve Bank at a top level, and by the Financial Markets Authority at a product level, with an Ombudsman who can be appealed to when the public is unsatisfied with the banks’ response. This is because we recognise that holding money, loaning money, investing money and earning interest on your customers’ money are all activities which require extreme levels of caution. It’s a result of decades of careful thinking – and of them being born at a time when the government had a far more muscular sense of its role in business and society. By contrast, search and social media arose during a global period in which regulation was a dirty word. There was a sincere belief that the nascent internet of the early 90s was a fragile, beautiful thing, which could be crushed by an excess of rules. Into that vacuum were born companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Starting small, they became leviathans. This was because they built incredible products, but also because there were no specific rules to restrain them. That remains largely true – particularly in New Zealand. One example of this is advertising, the source of well over a billion dollars in combined annual revenue for Google and Meta. Where traditional media’s clients are highly vetted, and there are significant penalties and outcry when real or perceived violation of codes occurs, there is no similar oversight or consequence for search or social media advertising. All this helps explain why we have come to accept that frauds and scams which originate through Facebook posts and advertising are a problem for banks, but a profit centre for Facebook. Last week, ASB chair Dame Therese Walsh sounded a warning during a select committee hearing on banking competition. “They are not required to fully participate in New Zealand society. Pay taxes, employ people, meet the rules and regulations, et cetera. That is actually a big concern of the way we’re going, that it’s going to be really difficult if we don’t create a level playing field.” She was talking, with some self-interest, about new entrants into the open banking sector. However what she says perfectly describes the operating conditions for giant social media companies too. Kiwibank says 40% of scams originate on social media, largely Facebook – by far the biggest single source. Westpac puts the number at 30%, though says it’s a conservative estimate, as a customer can be unaware of how they became a target, giving up their email address or phone number innocently, only to have it used for something malicious. Singapore has more specific notification requirements, and says that fully 50% of scams originate on Meta platforms. The top two scams, according to Westpac, are both relatively low dollar – “fraudulent e-commerce” is the most common, followed by “classifieds / goods / services / marketplace scams”. E-commerce fraud is in some ways the original sin of internet scams. It often involves someone misusing someone else’s credit card number to make purchases for themself. The credit card number might be obtained in bulk after a hack on the dark web, or through a fake site which convinces a user to input their credit card details, potentially through a Facebook ad. The second category is a more recent, and faster growing phenomenon. “There’s really low due diligence to sell something on Facebook Marketplace,” says Jurkovich. “So anyone can go on there and report to be selling something. And Meta’s response to it has been zero.” McGrath agrees, pointing out that this growth area impacts young people, and is likely wildly underreported. “We tend to think that scams impact older people. The Marketplace type scams more impact young people, right? And it’s for small amounts, but it’s for a higher frequency.” Marketplace is a product that competes with the likes of TradeMe in New Zealand – but lacks many of the guardrails which exist there, such as a list of feedback and transaction history. Wired reported earlier this year that it has become awash with phishing links, whereby users will send a fake link to a transfer site like Zelle in order to fraudulently capture the seller’s bank details. It also exists on the other side of the transaction – a study by Lloyds bank says Marketplace is the biggest global source of scam tickets to live events. The fact of it being small dollar amounts makes it very difficult for the bank to flag them as suspicious, as they appear indistinguishable from regular day-to-day transactions. Adding to the issue is the fact that the so-called “mule” accounts associated with the scams can have the appearance of legitimacy. McGrath says a typical source would be an international student leaving at the end of study, selling the account they have used while here to a scammer. It has a three year history of ordinary, legitimate transactions, before becoming the basis for scams. Investment scams rank fifth in Westpac’s list of the most common categories – but because of their scale can be the source of the most troubling stories, like that of Taranaki pensioner Jill Creasy I mentioned at the beginning. Jurkovich and McGrath both cite a huge acceleration in the volume and sophistication of such scams. McGrath says that what is making this more difficult is that the quality of the scammers and the digital infrastructure they deploy is increasing all the time. Where once a fake bank site or email was characterised by grainy graphics and frequent typos, now they can be near-indistinguishable from the real thing. The same goes for those who get a prospective victim on the phone – Jurkovich says they have studied the scripts of bank employees, and they will coach customers to give the right answers to bank workers questioning a transaction. “Where scams are really hard, is I can’t look for any markers that say it’s not you moving the money, because it is you moving the money,” says McGrath. “You think you’re doing the right thing. However, you’ve been bamboozled by somebody… Nobody wants to be on the receiving end of somebody saying, ‘I’ve lost my life savings’. We say, what could we have feasibly done?” For banks that have spent years trying to create strong digital products and reduce friction, they’re now contemplating introducing more of it – most prominently confirmation of payee, matching account names to numbers. This will certainly interrupt some types of fraud, but it’s common for an investment fraudster to invent a story about why a transaction needs to go into a particular account to “cool off” before reaching its destination. So no one in banking believes it to be a total solution. Social media is not the only place fraud happens. In recent years there has been a proliferation of SMS-based fraud, with messages purporting to be from banks, NZTA, Customs or the IRD, containing a short-code link to a website. For a period of time, these were arriving almost weekly. To send them, all a scammer needed was a large list of phone numbers, and use one of a number of different text marketing services or devices to widely distribute their phishing link. In this case these numbers were ultimately associated with particular New Zealand cell connections, typically with accounts at Spark, One NZ or 2 Degrees – the big three telecommunications providers. According to Jurkovich, the contrast between such companies and Meta could not be more stark. “It’s almost the complete opposite, which is a real willingness to share capability, real willingness to share knowledge. No bunfight between Spark, 2 Degrees and One NZ – they recognise that they have to lift their capability in unison.” The heads of the telecommunications companies have sometimes joined bank CEOs on their scam prevention calls, according to Jurkovich, who says it’s a clear indication of the seriousness with which they view the issue. And a stark contrast with Facebook. Like banking, telecommunications is an area in which competition, pricing and consumer outcomes are highly scrutinised, with regular market studies, and the motherlode which was the separation of Telecom from Chorus in the 2000s. Beyond the regulatory regime, Jurkovich says it’s also about how accessible the New Zealand businesses are. “​​I think it is as simple in some ways as you know, we’re on the high street and we’re easy to find. You know, where do you go to find Meta in New Zealand? They’re everywhere and nowhere.” That extends to the government too. Who exactly is charged with overseeing the social media companies? We have a minister for racing, a minister for arts, a minister for sports – even a minister for space. Yet even figuring out which minister oversees social media is difficult. A few years ago I asked then-broadcasting minister Willie Jackson who he thought was responsible for the social giants. “I guess it’s me,” he replied. Last week I asked DPMC, the all-powerful group which sits behind the prime minister and cabinet. They told me it was internal affairs minister and Act deputy leader Brooke Van Velden. I requested an interview, only to be told that “after discussions here, we’ve realised this is one for the minister of commerce and consumer affairs, Hon Andrew Bayly.” It feels telling that as far as social media goes – among the most influential developments in the history of the internet – the government still isn’t quite sure who is in charge. Bayly has only been given the specific responsibility of social media within the scams context in the last few weeks. I spoke to him for half an hour on a Friday morning, and he stressed that he had been working hard to get up to speed on its role in scams. He says his preference is for a multilateral approach, largely because he fears for our ability to legislate in isolation. “The unfortunate thing is, they are obviously a global company, and New Zealand’s a very small part of that pie.” The perception that it is too large, and New Zealand too small, is to Facebook’s distinct advantage. You detect a strain of fear when talking to politicians about large technology companies – that due to their geopolitical nature and immense entanglement with our lives, no one wants to upset them. “Everyone’s struggling with the social media platforms,” says Bayly. “It’s not just New Zealand, Australia is struggling with it, Singapore struggles with it. France and Britain. Everyone’s struggling with it.” That’s not particularly accurate. Australia has introduced legislation to fine both banks and social media companies up to $50m for failure to prevent scams. Singapore has changed regulations to require verification of sellers. Malaysia has gone step further, requiring large social platforms to apply for an annual licence to operate in an effort to curb rampant scams and cyber-bullying. Meta has criticised the law as likely to prevent “innovation” in social media. Society can decide which problem it thinks is the more egregious. What Bayly seems to be hoping is that by working closely with counterparts in Australia and Singapore, New Zealand might be able to catch up from what currently feels like a long way back on technology and scams. He says that Meta has signed with the FMA about verifying the identity of financial services advertisers as evidence of progress – though when contacted, the FMA said it was in fact Google that signed the agreement. Bayly is not currently considering a fines-based system of coercion, and wouldn’t contemplate withdrawing government advertising from social media because “some people, that’s the only place they go”. Today, at the start of ‘fraud week’, he is announcing a push to create greater co-ordination between banks, social media companies and telcos around scam activity. He says this is needed in part for fear of pulling down accounts associated with legitimate businesses. Based on Reeve’s reporting, it’s not clear that Facebook is remotely interested in pulling down the accounts of paying clients, regardless of how illegitimate their businesses are. Until it is incentivised to do so, scammers will likely continue to be a bank problem and Facebook income stream. Catherine McGrath took up her role at Westpac during the pandemic, after a long period working in the UK. She finds the level of effort and thought which has gone into social media here wholly inadequate. “In the UK, they’ve put in legislation in 2023 and that starts to put accountability around fake ads. In Australia, they’re doing some quite interesting work, particularly on scams, where the government there is intending to put onus on social media companies as well as telcos and banks – the whole ecosystem, to make culpability clear and to make sure everybody’s incentivised to protect Australians. “I would love our government here to do the same thing.” As of today, there is no momentum around that outcome. We continue to live with the consequences of a highly regulated sector abutting a completely unregulated one, with consumers the casualty in between. There is no minister wholly responsible for social media, which sits unloved among a pile of portfolios, nor any momentum building for creating one. Facebook takes the profits from selling scam ads, while banks – and ultimately New Zealanders – hold the losses. I asked McGrath why they continued to show up on Facebook at all. Whether their presence there – for customer service, for content, for advertising – both funds and legitimises a platform which has shown by its actions an indifference to banks, by being paid to run ads for criminal activity targeting bank customers. “I think it is worth contemplating”, says McGrath, of whether the bank should consider leaving Facebook. “If, as an industry, we don’t think they’re stepping up, then one of the ways to help your customers not get fooled is to say we won’t put any of our stuff on it. So if you see anything with a big red W on it, it’s definitely not us…. I think there’s an interesting principles-versus-pragmatism debate that is definitely worth exploring and thinking about.” This is not without precedent. Media giant Stuff made the decision to cease posting to Facebook entirely in 2020, while beauty giant Lush did the same in 2021, with its accounts now sitting dormant under a header reading “be somewhere else”. Jurkovich said Kiwibank had not considered the idea, but would not rule it out. Both CEOs are stunned at the way the level of scrutiny and expectation from the government towards banks is not matched by any significant effort from the social giant. Speaking to people in government, there is a sense of impotence. That New Zealand is too small to get the attention of Facebook, and that the best way to achieve change is by joining other countries in multilateral approaches. It’s true in theory, but Facebook is approaching its 21st birthday, and only speeding up. It’s to the company’s distinct advantage for legislators to hold back, and to focus their attention on companies it can control. In the meantime, Facebook will keep running whatever ads it’s paid to, and only grow larger, stronger and harder to control.

Recommendations from Wall Street can help them make informed decisions on stocks and seek solid long-term returns. Top-rated analysts pay attention to multiple aspects when selecting stocks of companies with solid fundamentals and strong execution. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start this week with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). The company impressed investors with third-quarter beats on the top and bottom lines, fueled by strength in its cloud and advertising businesses. In reaction to the solid Q3 print, Monness analyst Brian White reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock and boosted the price target to $245 from $225. While the analyst acknowledged regulatory pressures, he remains bullish on AMZN as he thinks it will continue to "capitalize on the cloud, expand its digital ad business, innovate with AI, realize efficiencies from a regional fulfillment network, and leverage a leaner cost structure." White highlighted that Amazon's revenue growth accelerated to 17%, with significant profit upside. Notably, Q3 operating profit exceeded his estimates, driving record operating margin at 11%. He also noted the sharp sequential rise in operating margins at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and International business. Based on the solid results, the analyst raised his revenue and earnings per share estimates for 2024 and 2025. White also pointed out Amazon's focus on reducing costs via improved efficiencies and new initiatives such as regionalizing its U.S. fulfillment network. The company now aims to regionalize its U.S. inbound network and leverage advanced robotic innovations across its fulfillment network. Overall, White sees lucrative growth potential for Amazon across e-commerce, AWS, digital media, advertising, Alexa, robotics, artificial intelligence and other avenues. White ranks No. 38 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.4%. See Amazon Stock Charts on TipRanks. We now move to this week's second pick, ride-sharing platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company recently delivered better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings. However, it missed Wall Street's expectations for Q3 gross bookings. Nonetheless, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney remains bullish on UBER stock. He reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $120, following a series of investor meetings with management. Mahaney thinks UBER will gain from autonomous vehicle rollouts, given its position as the largest ride-sharing demand aggregator. He added that better availability of robotaxis on the Uber platform will drive improved customer service through shorter wait times, broader ride selection and possibly lower prices. "UBER believes that the economics it can offer AV owners can be compelling, allowing them to generate very high margins and better fleet utilization than they can develop on their own," said Mahaney. Based on his discussions with management, Mahaney explained that the deceleration reflecting in Uber's Mobility bookings growth in Q3 and the estimate for Q4 is due to the negative demand elasticity caused by the surge in insurance costs and a slowdown in "party hour" bookings, or those that take place during evenings and weekends. He thinks this deceleration will moderate, given the slowdown in the rate of insurance cost increases, growth prospects of new products such as Uber for Teens and Uber for Business as well as potential improvement in consumer discretionary demand. Finally, Mahaney remains confident about Uber's ability to consistently boost its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow margins over the next three to five years, supported by multiple measures to drive cost efficiencies. Mahaney ranks No. 34 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 28.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Options on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at fintech giant Block (SQ). The company, formerly known as Square, narrowly beat analysts' earnings expectations but missed revenue estimates for the third quarter. Following the results, BTIG analyst Andrew Harte discussed the positives and negatives of Block's Q3 performance. He noted that the company's initial FY25 gross profit growth guidance of at least 15% almost met the consensus estimate at 14.9%. However, Q4 gross profit outlook of 14% fell short of expectations due to the shift in the timing of certain expected benefits from Q4 to next year. The analyst thinks CEO Jack Dorsey did a good job in highlighting the company's lending products and explaining how they are fueling the growth of Block's ecosystem. Despite the soft Q4 guidance and management's commentary indicating that investors will have to wait until the second half of 2025 for growth acceleration, SQ stock continues to be a top pick for BTIG. Harte cited several reasons for his bullish stance, including Block's track record of surpassing guidance and the stock's attractive valuation at 12-times FY25 EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA. He added that the company is in the early days of fueling increased product adoption in both its Cash and Square ecosystems, indicating continued growth potential ahead. "Block is just beginning to integrate its Cash App and Square ecosystems, which could create meaningful flywheel effects over time," said Harte while reiterating a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $90. Harte ranks No. 152 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 75% of the time, delivering an average return of 63.8%.

Title: Trump’s Election Is Also a Win for Tech’s Right-Wing “Warrior Class”

Time Published: 2024-11-17T11:00:00Z

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Silicon Valley has successfully rebranded military contracting as a proud national duty for the industry. Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known. During his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools. These men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race. Trump’s election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta’s recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the “Big Five” American tech firms — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta — not engaged in military or intelligence contracting. Elon Musk has drawn the lion’s share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world’s richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use. But Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump’s ear on policy matters. After election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” Musk wrote. Anduril’s rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024. Big Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump’s first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as “bad ass” and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a “decisive victory.” Zuckerberg added that he is “looking forward to working with you and your administration.” To some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley’s origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that “it’s wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally” and urged lawmakers to “secure our borders so this never happens again.” The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn’t meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration’s eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden. What has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud. A year after Luckey’s ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud’s chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,” she wrote. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.” It’s an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country’s talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. “Societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company’s contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. “You need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.” This “warrior class” mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. “Everything that we’re doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,” Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump’s first major backer in tech, rejected the “ethical framing” of the question of whether to build weapons.” When it’s a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,” he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it’s particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been “infiltrated by Chinese intelligence” and two years later suggested that bitcoin is “a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.” Thiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on “faraway wars” while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos — though Thiel has remained silent on Trump’s large expansion of the Obama administration’s drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, “I defer to Israel.” Thiel’s gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech’s realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel’s investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel’s main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest. An earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release. The ripple effect of Palantir’s success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel’s Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a “thin pagan religion” of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup. “Trump has surrounded himself with ‘techno-optimists’ — people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,” Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. “Key members of his inner circle — leading tech executives — describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.” The worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it’s rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling. Stephens’s 2022 admonition that “the business of war is the business of deterrence” argues that “peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems” — an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military’s overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that “it’s important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I’ll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.” William Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. “Peter Thiel’s whole thing is to privatize the state,” Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. “This alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,” he said. “We won’t lose the men over there because we’ll have these drones.” In this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn’t so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever. The new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley’s most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump’s reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.” The firm knows full well what it’s evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society’s greatest virtue: Listed among the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism” is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto. The venture capitalists’ document offers a clear rebuttal of employees’ moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of “ethics,” “safety,” and “social responsibility” as a “demoralization campaign” of “zombie ideas, many derived from Communism” pushed by “the enemy.” This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers. “There’s a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‘woke culture,’” said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. “It’s just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn’t be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.” Despite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that’s melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely “woke.” A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning “military Zyndustrial complex” commonly known as “the Gundo,” described the city as “California’s freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.” It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build “nuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China” beneath “an American flag the size of a dumpster” and “a life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.” The American right’s hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. “I gotta hand it to the VCs, they’re really good at comms,” said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company’s involvement in Project Maven. “They’re really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It’s been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.” A wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. “The workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.” This rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund’s “American Dynamism” portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund’s American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump. Even the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what’s trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to “pattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.” The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital. There’s every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to “Make America First in AI” by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he’ll reverse the Biden administration’s executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump’s transition team on policy matters. “‘Make America First in AI’ means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,” Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. “That translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.” The mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign’s terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country’s next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. “We did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,” he said of Anduril. “I think we will do even better now.” Matt Sledge Pam Bondi has replaced Matt Gaetz in Trump's attorney general slot. Her lobbying clients include the GEO Group, among many others. The Intercept Briefing The Intercept Briefing Rep.
