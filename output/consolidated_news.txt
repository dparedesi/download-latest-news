JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the Wall Street lender plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC) to its customers in a stark shift from his historical stance toward the digital asset. During JPMorgan’s Investor Day, Dimon reiterated that he is “not a fan” of Bitcoin, but acknowledged that clients will continue to demand access to it. He said: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” He also clarified that the bank does not plan on offering custody services. Dimon’s criticism of crypto is consistent with past remarks. In a January interview, he called Bitcoin “worthless.” He tied it to criminal activity, repeating concerns raised in his 2023 Senate testimony, in which he advocated for shutting down the industry altogether. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, he referred to Bitcoin as a “pet rock,” while in April of the same year, Dimon called crypto a “Ponzi Scheme.” In his May 19 remarks, he also stated that “blockchain doesn’t matter as much” as people think. However, JPMorgan has continued to build infrastructure around blockchain technology for institutional use. Earlier this month, Kinexys completed a test transaction that bridged its private network to a public layer-1 blockchain, using tokenized short-term Treasury assets and real-time settlement protocols. Chainlink and Ondo Finance participated in this pilot. Additionally, Kinexys processes over $2 billion in transactions daily and plans to scale up dollar-euro settlements using JPM Coin, JPMorgan’s proprietary token. Amid the remarks on Bitcoin offering, JPMorgan’s 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the first quarter of 2025 showed a dramatic increase in crypto exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of March 31, the firm reported $16.3 million in crypto-related holdings, up from $1 million at the end of 2024. The lender’s crypto exposure is primarily via Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked instruments. As of March 31, JPMorgan held a little over 263,000 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and around 3000 shares of Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB). The lender also held shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Mini Trust ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and new allocations to Bitwise and Franklin Templeton Ethereum products. The firm’s crypto-related holdings are just a tiny fraction of its $4.4 trillion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter. It’s unclear how much of the portfolio reflects proprietary positioning versus facilitation of client demand. The bank has previously clarified that holding some ETF allocations could be a part of its market-making services.

Title: Market Expert Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $220,000 By Year End If This Happens

Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to show strength following a resilient recovery from its April lows. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $104,921. Notably, after dipping below $80,000 amid heightened U.S.-China tariff tensions, Bitcoin rebounded strongly, gaining approximately 25% in April alone before a further surge this month. Renewed institutional interest has bolstered this upward momentum, including significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. That said, in this bullish environment, market analyst “apsk32” has projected that Bitcoin could reach $220,000 by the end of 2025 if its historical correlation with gold remains intact. In a recent tweet, the pundit argued that Bitcoin’s price movements continue to reflect long-term patterns tied to gold, not fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which he claims distorts BTC’s real value due to inflation. “The peg to fiat hides the truth,” he stated, citing a valuation model that prices Bitcoin in ounces of gold rather than dollars. The model uses a power-law function, a mathematical formula that accounts for Bitcoin’s cyclical nature. According to the analyst, Bitcoin currently represents over 643 million ounces of gold in market capitalization. This relationship, he suggested, puts the digital asset on track to match or exceed $220,000 in the coming months, assuming gold’s rally continues and Bitcoin maintains its historical pattern of lagging gold’s movements by a few months. Notably, Gold recently reached a record price of $3,500 per ounce, forming what the analyst describes as a “very bright” backdrop for Bitcoin. Although a theoretical top of $444,000 is possible based on this model, the analyst noted he believes $220,000 is a more realistic ceiling for 2025. But the journey to that target is not without obstacles. Market data shows a significant liquidity barrier between $105,000 and $110,000, where large sell orders could suppress upward momentum. Key support is seen at around $98,000 to $100,000, a level some analysts call “critical” for sustaining the uptrend. Elsewhere, Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto trader and founder of MN Trading, echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin needs to hold above $98,000 to continue its bullish momentum. “It’s the last major consolidation before the breakout,” he said. Meanwhile, other prominent voices have weighed in with similar bullish predictions. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, doubled down on his support for Bitcoin, calling it a hedge against a collapsing central banking system. “I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250K this year. Buy more. Do not sell,” he urged his followers on Saturday However, not all indicators point to a smooth ride. According to crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s short-term correlation to gold has recently dropped to -0.54, its lowest since February, implying that in the short run, BTC and gold are currently moving in opposite directions. Still, long-term correlations remain intact, with 90-day and 365-day values at 0.39 and 0.60, respectively.

Title: 'Deeply painful': Nvidia CEO says a new chip ban has cost it $15 billion

President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war has cost Nvidia (NVDA) $15 billion in business, the company’s CEO said Monday. Jensen Huang made the comments during an interview with tech analyst Ben Thompson at the Computex trade show in Taipei. He said that America’s restrictions against exporting its H20 chips in China has had an unprecedented impact on the firm. “We’ve written off — I think it’s $5.5 billion. No company in history has ever written off that much inventory, so this additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said. He continued: It’s “enormously costly. Not only am I losing $5.5 billion, we wrote off $5.5 billion, we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably — what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes.” Nvidia designed the H20 chip to comply with the Biden administration’s export rules. But those rules became even stricter under Trump and barred Nvidia from selling the chips in China, even after the company pared down their capabilities. While this is the first time Huang has cited a dollar amount publicly, it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. Wall Street analysts had estimated that Nvidia would suffer a hit of between $10 and $16 billion as a result of the ban. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $3.3 trillion. But its stock is down 2.1% so far this year amid the ongoing trade war. Meanwhile, while the U.S. limits its tech exports to the country, Chinese tech firms have put renewed focus on manufacturing chips in-house. Xiaomi said Monday thatit will invest at least $6.9 billion over the next decade to develop its own chips. In April, Huawei announced that it was getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia. Beijing has slammed the U.S. approach and Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: AI and Work (Some Predictions)
URL: https://calnewport.com/ai-and-work-some-predictions/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T17:41:52Z
Full Content:
One of the main topics of this newsletter is the quest to cultivate sustainable and meaningful work in a digital age. Given this objective, it’s hard to avoid confronting the furiously disruptive potentials of AI. I’ve been spending a lot time in recent years, in my roles as a digital theorist and technology journalist, researching and writing about this topic, so it occurred to me that it might be useful to capture in one place all of my current thoughts about the intersection of AI and work. The obvious caveat applies: these predictions will shift — perhaps even substantially — as this inherently unpredictable sector continues to evolve. But here’s my current best stab at what’s going on now, what’s coming soon, and what’s likely just hype. Let’s get to it… When generative AI made its show-stopping debut a few years ago, the smart money was on text production becoming the first killer app. For example, business users, it was thought, would soon outsource much of the tedious communication that makes up their day — meeting summaries, email, reports — into AI tools. A fair amount of this is happening, especially when it comes to lengthy utilitarian communication where the quality doesn’t matter much. I recently attended a men’s retreat, for example, and it was clear that the organizer had used ChatGPT to create the final email summarizing the weekend schedule. And why not? It got the job done and saved some time. It’s becoming increasingly clear, however, that for most people the act of writing in their daily lives isn’t a major problem that needs to be solved, which is capping the predicted ubiquity of this use case. (A survey of internet users found that only around 5.4% had used ChatGPT to help write emails and letters. And this includes the many who maybe experimented with this capability once or twice before moving on.) The application that has instead leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability, even if it’s not as sexy as creating AGI or automating all of knowledge work (more on these applications later). The other major success story for generative AI at the moment is computer programming. Individuals with only rudimentary knowledge of programming languages can now produce usable prototypes of simple applications using tools like ChatGPT, and somewhat more advanced projects with AI-enhanced agent-style helpers like Roo Code. This can be really useful for quickly creating tools for personal use or seeking to create a proof-of-concept for a future product. The tech incubator Y Combinator, for example, made waves when they reported that a quarter of the start-ups in their Winter 2025 batch generated 95% or more of their product’s codebases using AI. How far can this automated coding take us? An academic computer scientist named Judah Diament recently went viral for noting that the ability for novice users to create simple applications isn’t new. There have been systems dedicated to this purpose for over four decades, from HyperCard to VisualBasic to Flash. As he elaborates: “And, of course, they all broke down when anything slightly complicated or unusual needs to be done (as required by every real, financially viable software product or service).” This observation created major backlash — as does most expressions of AI skepticism these days — but Diament isn’t wrong. Despite recent hyperbolic statements by tech leaders, many professional programmers aren’t particularly worried that their jobs can be replicated by language model queries, as so much of what they do is experience-based architecture design and debugging, which are unrelated skills for which we currently have no viable AI solution. Software developers do, however, use AI heavily: not to produce their code from scratch, but instead as helper utilities. Tools like GitHub’s Copilot are integrated directly into the environments in which these developers already work, and make it much simpler to look up obscure library or AI calls, or spit out tedious boilerplate code. The productivity gains here are notable. Programming without help from AI is rapidly becoming increasingly rare. Language model-based AI systems can respond to prompts in pretty amazing ways. But if we focus only on outputs, we underestimate another major source of these models’ value: their ability to understand human language. This so-called natural language processing ability is poised to transform how we use software. There is a push at the moment, for example, led by Microsoft and its Copilot product (not to be confused with GitHub Copilot), to use AI models to provide natural language interfaces to popular software. Instead of learning complicated sequences of clicks and settings to accomplish a task in these programs, you’ll be able to simply ask for what you need; e.g., “Hey Copilot, can you remove all rows from this spreadsheet where the dollar amount in column C is less than $10 dollars then sort everything that remains by the names in Column A? Also, the font is too small, make it somewhat larger.” Enabling novice users to access to expert-level features in existing software will aggregate into huge productivity gains. As a bonus, the models required to understand these commands don’t have to be nearly as massive and complicated as the current cutting-edge models that the big AI companies use to show off their technology. Indeed, they might be small enough to run locally on devices, making them vastly cheaper and more efficient to operate. Don’t sleep on this use case. Like smart search, it’s also not as sexy as AGI or full automation, but I’m increasingly convinced that within the next half-decade or so, informally-articulated commands are going to emerge as one of the dominate interfaces to the world of computation. One of the more attention-catching storylines surrounding AI at the moment is the imminent arrival of so-called agents which will automate more and more of our daily work, especially in the knowledge sectors once believed to be immune from machine encroachment. Recent reports imply that agents are a major part of OpenAI’s revenue strategy for the near future. The company imagines business customers paying up to $20,000 a month for access to specialized bots that can perform key professional tasks. It’s the projection of this trend that led Elon Musk to recently quip: “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job. But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.” But progress in creating these agents has recently slowed. To understand why requires a brief snapshot of the current state of generative AI technology… Not long ago, there was a belief in so-called scaling laws that argued, roughly speaking, that as you continued to increase the size of language models, their abilities would continue to rapidly increase. For a while this proved true: GPT-2 was much better than the original GPT, GPT-3 was much better than GPT-2, and GPT-4 was a big improvement on GPT-3. The hope was that by continuing to scale these models, you’d eventually get to a system so smart and capable that it would achieve something like AGI, and could be used as the foundation for software agents to automate basically any conceivable task. More recently, however, these scaling laws have begun to falter. Companies continue to invest massive amounts of capital in building bigger models, trained on ever-more GPUs crunching ever-larger data sets, but the performance of these models stopped leaping forward as much as they had in the past. This is why the long-anticipated GPT-5 has not yet been released, and why, just last week, Meta announced they were delaying the release of their newest, biggest model, as its capabilities were deemed insufficiently better than its predecessor. In response to the collapse of the scaling laws, the industry has increasingly turned its attention in another direction: tuning existing models using reinforcement learning. Say, for example, you want to make a model that is particularly good at math. You pay a bunch of math PhDs $100 an hour to come up with a lot of math problems with step-by-step solutions. You then take an existing model, like GPT-4, and feed it these problems one-by-one, using reinforcement learning techniques to tell it exactly where it’s getting certain steps in its answers right or wrong. Over time, this tuned model will get better at solving this specific type of problem. This technique is why OpenAI is now releasing multiple, confusingly-named models, each seemingly optimized for different specialties. These are the result of distinct tunings. They would have preferred, of course, to simply produce a GPT-5 model that could do well on all of these tasks, but that hasn’t worked out as they hoped. This tuning approach will continue to develop interesting tools, but it will be much more piecemeal and hit-or-miss than what was anticipated when we still believed in scaling laws. Part of the difficulty is that this approach depends on finding the right data for each task you want to tackle. Certain problems, like math, computer programming, and logical reasoning, are well-suited for tuning as they can be described by pairs of prompts and correct answers. But this is not the case for many other business activities, which can be esoteric and bespoke to a given context. This means many useful activities will remain un-automatable by language model agents into the foreseeable future. I once said that the real Turing Test for our current age is an AI system that can successfully empty my email inbox, a goal that requires the mastery of any number of complicated tasks. Unfortunately for all of us, this is not a test we’re poised to see passed any time soon. The Free Press recently published an article titled “AI Will Change What it Means to Be Human. Are We Ready?”. It summarized a common sentiment that has been feverishly promoted by Silicon Valley in recent years: that AI is on the cusp of changing everything in unfathomably disruptive ways. As the article argues: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asserted in a recent talk that GPT-5 will be smarter than all of us. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei described the powerful AI systems to come as “a country of geniuses in a data center.” These are not radical predictions. They are nearly here. But here’s the thing: these are radical predictions. Many companies tried to build the equivalent of the proposed GPT-5 and found that continuing to scale up the size of their models isn’t yielding the desired results. As described above, they’re left tuning the models they already have for specific tasks that are well-described by synthetic data sets. This can produce cool demos and products, but it’s not a route to a singular “genius” system that’s smarter than humans in some general sense. Indeed, if you look closer at the rhetoric of the AI prophets in recent months, you’ll see a creeping awareness that, in a post-scaling law world, they no longer have a convincing story for how their predictions will manifest. A recent Nick Bostrom video, for example, which (true to character) predicts Superintelligence might happen in less than two years (!), adds the caveat that this outcome will require key “unlocks” from the industry, which is code for we don’t know how to build systems that achieve this goal, but, hey, maybe someone will figure it out! (The AI centrist Gary Marcus subsequently mocked Bostrom by tweeting: “for all we know, we could be just one unlock and 3-6 weeks away from levitation, interstellar travel, immortality, or room temperature superconductors, or perhaps even all four!”) Similarly, if you look closer at AI 2027, the splashy new doomsday manifesto which argues that AI might eliminate humanity as early as 2030, you won’t find a specific account of what type of system might be capable of such feats of tyrannical brilliance. The authors instead sidestep the issue by claiming that within the next year or so, the language models we’re tuning to solve computer programming tasks will somehow come up with, on their own, code that implements breakthrough new AI technology that mere humans cannot understand. This is an incredible claim. (What sort of synthetic data set do they imagine being able to train a language model to crack the secrets of human-level intelligence?) It’s the technological equivalent of looking at the Wright Brother’s Flyer in 1903 and thinking, “well, if they could figure this out so quickly, we should have space travel cracked by the end of the decade.” The current energized narratives around AGI and Superintelligence seem to be fueled by a convergence of three factors: (1) the fact that scaling laws did apply for the first few generations of language models, making it easy and logical to imagine them continuing to apply up the exponential curve of capabilities in the years ahead; (2) demos of models tuned to do well on specific written tests, which we tend to intuitively associate with intelligence; and (3) tech leaders pounding furiously on the drums of sensationalism, knowing they’re rarely held to account on their predictions. But here’s the reality: We are not currently on a trajectory to genius systems. We might figure this out in the future, but the “unlocks” required will be sufficiently numerous and slow to master that we’ll likely have plenty of clear signals and warning along the way. So, we’re not out of the woods on these issues, but at the same time, humanity is not going to be eliminated by the machines in 2030 either. In the meantime, the breakthroughs that are happening, especially in the world of work, should be both exciting and worrisome enough on their own for now. Let’s grapple with those first. #### For more of my thoughts on AI, check out my New Yorker archive and my podcast (in recent months, I often discuss AI in the third act of the show). For more on my thoughts on technology and work more generally, check out my recent books on the topic: Slow Productivity, A World Without Email, and Deep Work. I agree with natural language commands to be an awesome use-case that people are sleeping on! I have two examples of messing around with ai where I realized if they just got a little bit better at this, it would change everything. First, ai can already identify information in photos. I uploaded a picture of myself to ChatGPT and it started describing how I look. That was a neat trick. But once you can upload screenshots and it can read, transcribe, or act on every piece of information in the photo? Hey here is a screenshot of my spreadsheet, tell me how to fix it. Hey here is a screenshot of a web design that I like, please convert it into code for me. Second, using Cursor.ai IDE, I can ask the agents how to use the program and where things are in the program and of course it can write code, save files, delete files, make directories, prompt commands, and be a search engine all in one. I didn’t know where some of the stuff in the program was and it just told me where it was. I didn’t know how everything worked in the program and it just told me how it works. And then of course it also codes and makes commands for everything I ask. So imagine a future where in every single program you use on the computer, you can quickly screenshot it and ask how to do something or how to fix something and it tells you exactly how to do it, or just does it for you. Now I feel like all the talk about real agents is kind of hyped up? Like just because my IDE can do IDE tasks for me people seem to think agents are going to do my taxes for me and answer all my emails for me automatically. But I think that’s kind of just a dream. “Agent” seems to just be the new term for a long complicated process that had been automated. But I bet instead of the “agent” figuring all that out for itself, it’s going to happen the old fashioned way, where a bunch of engineers work very hard to automate a task. You know, like we’ve been doing for decades already. The photo analysis example is a great one. I think of that as part of the general idea of a super search, where now, the sources for its answer isn’t just the web, but also other things, like photos, or files on your local machine, etc. Sort of like a Google for everything which is, it seems to me, likely where the bulk of the money is actually waiting in the AI race. I agree that superintelligence in 2030 is very unlikely, and it’s good to communicate that. But I think superintelligence in 2040 is totally in the territory of “maybe, maybe not, who knows”, and by not emphasizing or mentioning that, you’re burying the lede. Anything that humans, and groups of humans, and societies of humans, can do, can also be done by code running on chips. After all, the human brain is a machine that runs an algorithm. No one knows the algorithm, but as soon as someone figures it out, they could run it on chips, like any other algorithm. Then we’d get AIs that can autonomously found and run billion-dollar companies, that can invent science and technology and language from scratch, and all the other crazy sci-fi-sounding stuff. And there could be hundreds of millions of such AIs, thinking much faster than humans, etc. Why do I say that “superintelligence by 2040” is in “maybe, maybe not, who knows” territory? Well, LLMs didn’t exist as recently as 2018. The entirety of deep learning was a backwater as recently as 2012. You can say that LLMs are not on the path to superintelligence, and as it happens, I’ll agree with you. But 15 years is evidently more than enough time for the AI research community to have pivoted to something entirely different and poured billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of person-years, into polishing and optimizing it. As an analogy, suppose a giant fleet of alien ships were definitely due to arrive on Earth at some point, but we didn’t know when, and 15-40 years seemed like a reasonable guess. But some people were going around saying the aliens would definitely arrive in <5 years. Then it would be good to correct those people! But it would be bad to imply that therefore we shouldn’t be thinking about and preparing for the alien invasion right now. The death of Moore’s Law (measuring transistors) was the birth of LLM scaling / virtual quantity (measuring virtual parameters). The death of LLM scaling / virtual quantity will be virtual quality. The manifestation of the thing that is manifesting has been going on for 70+ years and there have been dozens of barriers that were said to be impassible, but the manifestation has always found a new thing. Now that the manifestation has manifested the ability to create PhD’s out of thin air to work for its manifestation, now is when you are going to doubt it ?? Humanity is a small thing, and the physical universe is a shallow one. Now some wave from a bigger pond is washing into ours.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We asked experts about the best foods to stock up on to save money and trips to the supermarket. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. A recent survey by CNET confirms that rising food costs remain the top source of sticker shock—and I can relate. Over time, we've explored various strategies to stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brands versus store brands, and even asking whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk. Stocking up on everyday staples at warehouse stores like Costco can lead to significant savings. In fact, after crunching the numbers, I found that the average person could potentially save around $1,000 a year by buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't always simple. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

ByExpert Panel® ByExpert Panel®, Forbes Councils Member. To a layperson, technology and biological life may seem like opposite poles. However, the tech industry regularly draws lessons from living organisms, striving to build tools and systems that not only learn, adapt and evolve—like artificial intelligence—but can also make decisions and take action in real time, as humans do. From neural networks to swarm robotics, many of today’s most sophisticated technologies are inspired by the natural functions and collective behavior of living organisms. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share compelling real-world examples of “living intelligence” technologies, as well as natural creatures and phenomena that are inspiring adaptive tech systems and tools. Read on to learn what the convergence of nature and technology signals for the future of humanity. As a cancer scientist, I use digital AI technology to analyze cancer tissue slides. I am impressed that this innovative technology can predict immune cell types with spatial context. It can derive thousands of features that human eyes can’t see. I can see a gold mine in front of us—some of these features can be groundbreaking in detecting cancer and predicting the outcomes of therapies. - Rachel Tam, Bristol Myers Squibb Starlings exemplify one of nature’s most mesmerizing displays of swarm intelligence in action. Their behavior demonstrates how simple sets of localized rules can give rise to complex collective phenomena. This natural model has applications in modeling complex systems through simple interaction rules, giving rise to emergent properties and behaviors that are otherwise difficult to simulate holistically. - Anuradha Weeraman, Verdentra Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? Neuralink’s brain-computer interface, which enables a person with quadriplegia to control devices with their thoughts, is stunning. It’s living intelligence merging AI and biotech to restore personal autonomy. Implications include revolutionizing healthcare and enhancing human capabilities—but it also raises ethical questions about privacy and cognitive augmentation. - Lori Schafer, Digital Wave Technology Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot, which can autonomously navigate complex terrains, is a powerful example of living intelligence in action. Its ability to adapt in real time mirrors biological instinct. The broader implication? AI and robotics are evolving from scripted automation to embodied cognition, unlocking transformative potential in defense, disaster response and industry. - Srinivasa Rao Bittla, Adobe Inc. One real-world example of living intelligence that impressed me is DeepMind’s AlphaFold. It accurately predicted protein structures, solving a 50-year-old challenge in biology. This breakthrough accelerates drug discovery and disease understanding—a glimpse into AI’s potential to revolutionize science and healthcare. - Akhilesh Sharma, A3Logics Inc. AI-powered satellite imagery analysis for deforestation monitoring has impressed me. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the Global Forest Watch project has improved accuracy and speed in detecting forest loss. This highlights the potential for AI to drive environmental sustainability and inform policy decisions, ultimately contributing to more effective conservation efforts. - Pooja Jain, Meta (Facebook) A compelling example of living intelligence in cloud and DevOps is Netflix’s Chaos Engineering platform, which simulates real-world failures to proactively test system resilience. This intelligent, self-healing infrastructure ensures uptime and performance at scale, highlighting how AI-driven automation and observability can revolutionize system reliability and DevOps maturity. - Hrushikesh Deshmukh, Fannie Mae One of the most interesting cases is one developed by Alibaba Cloud. “ET City Brain” monitors the entire traffic flow of the city of Hangzhou, China, in real time, analyzing cameras, sensors, GPS and traffic lights in order to optimize circulation and reduce traffic jams. Additionally, it responds instantly to any accident or special incident. - David Barberá Costarrosa, Beeping Fulfilment The distributed decision-making of honeybees is a strong example of biological intelligence. Through decentralized communication, bees make complex collective decisions, such as choosing their new hive. AI and robotics algorithms draw inspiration from nature’s teamwork, demonstrated by swarm intelligence, which provides efficient solutions to real-world problems. - Roshan Mahant, LaunchIT Corp. Ants build cities, farm aphids and coordinate like tiny logistics pros—all without a boss. That decentralized brilliance inspired algorithms behind things like traffic flow and delivery routing. Turns out, a little chaos with clear rules scales beautifully. Nature’s “dumb” systems often outsmart centralized control—sometimes the smartest move is letting go (strategically). - Joel Frenette, TravelFun.Biz Mycorrhizal networks—the “wood-wide web”—fascinate me. Through fungal connections, trees share resources and warnings, showing a form of collective intelligence. This challenges brain-centered definitions of intelligence and reveals the deep interdependence in ecosystems—an insight vital for sustainability. - Mohit Menghnani, Twilio Tesla’s self-driving cars are a powerful example of living intelligence, learning and evolving with real-time data. Their neural network adapts continuously, making decisions that improve over time. This dynamic AI system is transforming transportation and holds broad implications for industries like healthcare, manufacturing and logistics, offering new potential for automation and efficiency. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The human brain’s ability to recognize patterns and make decisions is a prime example of living intelligence that has deeply influenced the field of artificial intelligence. The brain’s ability to process complex data through interconnected neurons, for instance, has inspired the development of neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition and natural language processing. - Udit Mehrotra, Amazon Urban crows in Japan drop nuts onto crosswalks, timing traffic to crack shells and safely retrieve food—an elegant display of living intelligence improvising and adapting to an urban environment. Crows offer inspiration for AI and robotics: context-aware, adaptive and seamlessly integrated with human infrastructure. - Amy Gu, Dynamsoft Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology stands out as a prime example of living intelligence within the e-commerce field. The system enables customers to purchase items without waiting in lines by integrating AI technology with sensors and computer vision. The retail industry is being transformed through this seamless shopping experience toward fully autonomous and personalized, frictionless retail commerce. - Amit Ojha One real-world example of living intelligence is autonomous threat detection in financial networks using AI and behavioral analytics. I have seen systems flag and isolate anomalies in real time, without human intervention. The broader impact is clear: It proves that living intelligence can adapt, learn continuously and defend complex environments with speed and precision. - Srikanth Bellamkonda Over 10 years ago, Zappos impressed me with a smart checkout prompt: After I ordered shoes, its system suggested rubber boots because of the rain forecast around my delivery date. It blended personal context with weather data—a great early example of living intelligence, long before the likes of ChatGPT normalized the use of AI. - Agur Jõgi, Pipedrive A standout example of living intelligence is Costa Group’s use of computer-vision-powered robotic pollinators in tomato greenhouses. In place of bees, these AI-driven robots improved yield by up to 15%. This showcases how smart automation can solve ecological and regulatory challenges, opening doors for sustainable, tech-enabled agriculture worldwide. - Tarun Eldho Alias, Neem Inc. Humans are being inspired by slime mold's strategic mastery. Physarum polycephalum is a brainless single-celled organism that can solve mazes and optimize nutrient pathways, challenging our notions of intelligence. Its ability to make decisions and adapt to complex environments suggests cognition may be more distributed than we think. It’s inspiring developments in decentralized computing, robotics and urban planning. - Cristian Randieri, Intellisystem Technologies An AI tool that analyzes credit risk adapts to real-time life events like layoffs or health bills. Analyzing nontraditional signals can redefine lending fairness. This living intelligence bridges empathy and economics, hinting at a future where automated finance tools react with humanlike instinct. - Jitender Jain

Title: Big Tech's next AI bet is a 'watershed moment,' analyst says — and a $1 trillion opportunity

The Middle East could rapidly become the next major frontier for artificial intelligence, and U.S. tech giants are lining up to cash in. In what Wedbush analysts are calling a “watershed moment” for Big Tech, recent developments in the region mean the AI boom might be rapidly shifting its center of gravity. A wave of investment in AI infrastructure across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is signaling an acceleration in U.S. tech companies’ expansion abroad. According to a Monday note from analysts led by Dan Ives, the region is poised to become one of the most important global markets for AI over the next decade, potentially adding over $1 trillion. “We believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years,” the note said, “and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view.” Wedbush wrote that it is becoming “crystal clear” that the “AI Revolution has found its next major area of penetration...the Middle East.” This inflection point comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s recent high-profile visit to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which focused heavily on U.S. involvement in the region’s ambitious AI infrastructure plans. Among the standout deals: Humain, a Saudi-backed AI startup, announced it will deploy 18,000 of Nvidia’s (NVDA) cutting-edge AI chips to power a 500-megawatt data center — one of the largest of its kind. “[That announcement] is the start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,” the note said. “Riyadh and UAE will be a major buyer of AI chips, software, autonomous/robotics, and datacenters over the next decade.” For decades, the Gulf region has leveraged its oil wealth to diversify into new markets: finance, tourism, and energy-transition technologies. But this focus on AI might mark its most ambitious pivot yet. Governments in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi aren’t just buying chips — they’re buying a future in which the Middle East becomes a global AI hub. At the core of this strategy is a growing alliance between Gulf governments and U.S. technology companies. Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Palantir (PLTR), and Tesla (TSLA) are all positioning themselves in the region to be key players in what could be full-throttle AI buildout. The sharp pivot to the Middle East comes amid tensions between the U.S. and China. While Saudi Arabia is rolling out the red carpet for Nvidia’s latest-generation chips, China is seeing growing restrictions even on underpowered GPUs such as the H20, as the U.S. attempts to restrain the country’s domestic AI ambitions. This divergence is shaping up to be a central theme in the larger AI race. Wedbush characterized the Trump administration’s positioning as a “global game of high-stakes poker” to isolate China while turbocharging U.S. influence in the Gulf through technology. “China is clearly taking notice and this adds to the drama of the broader US/China tariff/trade talks over the coming months,” Wedbush said. The note said these developments are a “bullish indicator that further shows the US tech’s lead in this 4th Industrial Revolution.” And at the center of it all is Nvidia — and the “Godfather of AI,” as Wedbush calls CEO Jensen Huang — cementing its position not just as a hardware company, but as a geopolitical force shaping the future of artificial intelligence.

Title: Despite Backlash From Trump, DEI Hasn’t Disappeared at US Companies

Walmart Inc. stunned civil-rights activists in November by saying it was pulling back on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The world’s largest retailer said it would stop using the term “DEI” in official communications, remove some LGBTQ products from its website and no longer consider race and gender to boost diversity when granting supplier contracts, among other changes. Six months later, the company’s moves seem less like a reversal and more like modest changes. “Belonging” has replaced most mentions of DEI— a semantic transition that began two years ago— but jobs posted on the company website still call for applicants who will support its policy of “diversity, equity & inclusion.” A landing page boasts about goods from “LGBTQIA+ founded brands,” accompanied by the tagline “Pride always.” And Walmart offers similar pages for Hispanic-, Black- and women-owned brands, noting that some have been categorized in collaboration with external groups that offer diversity certifications. Walmart is hardly alone. Many programs at large US companies that have fallen under the diversity, equity and inclusion banner haven’t disappeared, according to interviews with more than two dozen senior staffers from large US companies and corporate advisors. Even businesses that have made announcements purporting to curtail their DEI initiatives have, in most cases, made mostly minor adjustments, while promising investors and employees that nothing meaningful has changed. A Walmart spokesman said the company is addressing outdated references in job postings. “Our goal is to foster a sense of belonging, create opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers, and be a Walmart for everyone. We want to make Walmart the best place to work and shop,” a Walmart spokesperson said. Executive orders targeting what President Donald Trump has termed “illegal DEI” have rattled general counsels across the country’s largest companies— especially a directive that federal agencies compile lists of organizations to target for investigation by May 21. The administration argues that rather than reducing bias and encouraging managers to hire and promote based on merit, DEI policies have been “deeply demeaning,” and have increased hostility between different groups. But the orders haven’t fundamentally changed employment law, no matter how sweeping they may sound, said Jonathan Segal, a partner at law firm Duane Morris. And in many cases, familiar DEI efforts remainbecause those programs weren’t discriminating against employees. “You can do almost everything you were doing before with modest changes,” Segal said. Nor have the orders persuaded executives that all the programs that came to be known as DEI were a bad idea. Many admit that some elements of DEI went too far. However, by and large they continue to believe that efforts to recruit, promote and retain candidates from underrepresented groups are key to making sure they have the most capable and talented staff. They are loathe to eliminate policies that help workers feel welcomed and supported. They continue to fear discrimination lawsuits from workers of color, women, LGBTQ people and those with disabilities— not to mention the wrath of investors and the press. With guidance from lawyers, many companies have focused on a handful of changes. Gone are specific targets for demographic representation across their workforces, though companies are still required to collect data on the race and gender of their employees. Some people who once had titles like “diversity officer” are now called something else and run newly renamed initiatives. Employee resource groups — affinity organizations that cater to a characteristic like race, gender, sexual orientation, disability status and more — face new scrutiny and limits on their spending, but most continue to exist. Health benefits for trans employees and employees’ trans family members have hardly budged. Internship and mentorship programs developed to elevate traditionally marginalized groups mostly remain, with the new caveat that anyone can apply. Recruiting programs, especially at historically Black colleges and universities, haven’t changed. Molson Coors Beverage Co., Ford Motor Co., Deloitte LLP, McDonald’s Corp. and Boeing Co. are among those who’ve sought applicants in recent weeks through partnerships with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a non-profit group that helps some of the country’s largest companies orchestrate internship and scholarship programs for students at HBCUs, primarily Black institutions and historically Black community colleges. In one example of how companies are trying to send one message to DEI critics and another to investors, last summer Lowe’s Cos. announced a rollback that would restructure its employee resource groups, curtail external sponsorships and limit participation in external workplace surveys. But in December, a top executive promised the scale of changes were limited: “These are the only changes that we have made,” Janice Dupré, executive vice president of human resources stressed at the company’s investor day, before touting the senior leadership team as “one of the most diverse in the Fortune 500.” “Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is embedded in our values and core to who we are as a company,” a Lowe’s spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re proud of our accomplishments, and we will continue to strive to cultivate a workplace that reflects the customers and communities where we operate and where everyone feels welcomed, valued and respected.” Subha Barry, once the chief diversity officer at Merrill Lynch, now runs Seramount, a company that provides workplace training and inclusive leadership plans for large companies. Because she stays away from more controversial discussions about social justice, she said she’s seen little impact on demand for her company’s services. “There’s a return to a new sense of normalcy where companies are adapting, adjusting,” she said. “Ninety percent of our companies are saying they don’t see any major disruptions happening in the long term.” DEI is the latest term used to describe corporate policies that developed in response to the Civil Rights Act. In the 1980s, as companies prepared for rising shares of women and people of color in the workforce, executives began developing programs to better recruit, develop and integrate talent. These efforts ultimately evolved into the myriad initiatives often called DEI. While initially centered on race, the acronym came to also embody programs that would benefit a variety of minority groups, including women, people who identify as LGBTQ, those with disabilities and veterans. Such recruitment and training programs were slow to produce results, and often developed only after an investigation found evidence of rampant discrimination. Then came the 2020 murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by a White police officer in Minneapolis, setting off waves of protests about racial justice. Corporate executives responded by adopting sweeping, transformative language to spur their workforces into action, and setting ambitious goals for boosting diversity in their ranks. But just as today’s rhetoric about DEI rollback run into the reality of corporate inertia, the loud calls for boosting DEI after Floyd’s death often amounted to merely incremental changes. Many companies poured money into expanding DEI efforts based on programs they already had, hoping increased attention to race would help them transform their workforces. Such efforts met resistance almost immediately, with critics arguing that diversity programs amounted to discrimination against White (and sometimes Asian) people. They argued that bias training blamed employees for the sins of their ancestors, amplifying rather than diminishing racial angst. The pushback gained steam with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, a landmark case that overturned affirmative action in college admissions in 2023. While not directly implicated in that ruling, corporate America quickly began to question whether its own programs — especially those open to people only on the basis of race or gender — might run afoul of the course set by the court. Meanwhile, Trump’s return to the presidency has elevated DEI’s most ardent critics. His administration has argued that “corporations and universities use DEI as an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices and illegal admissions preferences.” He’s intensified the pressure on federal contractors, who must pledge that they’re not engaging in “illegal DEI,” while providing little detail on what exactly that is. “President Trump’s executive order mandates recommendations to strengthen enforcement of federal civil rights laws against unlawful discrimination, including DEI initiatives, and he anticipates further actions to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. Meanwhile, critics like influencer Robby Starbuck and activist group Alliance Defending Freedom have pushed companies to stamp out even elements of DEI that don’t violate the law, arguing that employers shouldn’t be making statements or instituting policies that express “woke” beliefs, especially about gender or race. Starbuck has said he intends to go after companies who pledged to abandon DEI but whose commitment was only “surface level.” Companies “don’t want to end up on a list, don’t want to be a target,” said Craig Leen, a partner at law firm K&L Gates and the former director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs during Trump’s first term. Trump has ordered each federal agency to identify up to nine large companies, associations and nonprofit groups that should be investigated over DEI policies. But while the administration’s signaled a new enforcement priority, the president’s actions haven’t meaningfully changed anti-discrimination law. “A lot of what companies are doing in the DEI area they’re still able to do,” Leen said, though he suggests they consider re-branding. In response, many large employers have pulled back on any initiative that might inhabit a legal gray area. DEI critics have argued that numeric goals for workforce demographics, even when only aspirational, effectively amount to illegal quotas; such metrics were on the chopping block at almost half of companies who announced changes to their DEI plans, according to a Gravity Research study. Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. are among financial firms who said they’d no longer require hiring managers to interview a diverse slate of job candidates. Segal, the employment law specialist, also tells clients to go a step further, revisiting the underlying messaging behind their DEI plans. For example, companies that say they want a workforce that “reflects the diversity of the community” might draw scrutiny, because it could be seen as suggesting a company employ a certain number of people from each demographic group. But seeking a workforce that “reflects the talent in our community” likely mitigates the risk. Surely all companies have a responsibility to shareholders to seek out the best talent, taking care to look for people with backgrounds that might historically have been overlooked. “It sounds a little bit like semantics, but the words matter,” Segal said. He estimates that three quarters of firms he’s worked with “have made changes to their communications” about diversity initiatives to ensure that they can’t be interpreted as discriminatory, but by and large the underlying programs remain intact. Companies are also saying less. The director of a nonprofit group focused on Latino entrepreneurship said it had scrapped a planned press release about financial backing from corporate philanthropy. The donor didn’t want publicity, even though they’d sought such recognition in the past. Similarly, a banker said his employer balked at adding its name to an event championing Latinos in tech, but still sponsored the event for its client-building potential. In a survey of C-suite executives published in February, law firm Littler Mendelson PC found 55% were more concerned about the risk of lawsuits related to DEI after Trump’s inauguration than they were before. Even so, 49% of respondents said they were not considering any new or further rollbacks of their programs after Trump’s executive orders, while 27% said they were considering them only “to a small extent.” In the short term, they’re simply desperate to avoid government scrutiny. Johnny Taylor, the CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, said leaders of large public companies mostly want to maintain diversity and inclusion programming that keeps workers happy. Executives don’t want to find their companies’ names on a government list of “woke” companies, he said. But they’re also worried that top law firms who’ve struck deals with the Trump administration — like Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and Latham & Watkins LLP — will fulfill their pledges to provide pro bono legal services by representing aggrieved former employees claiming reverse discrimination. What Taylor hears from CEOs is a version of: “Tell us what we can do that will affirm our commitment to this work but is not going to get us sued and get us into a protracted legal battle,” he explained. One way executives are solving that puzzle is by keeping battles quiet. A few companies, including Costco Wholesale Corp. and Apple Inc., have publicly defended their diversity efforts in the face of proposals from conservative groups to curtail those initiatives. But Deere & Co., McDonald’s and IBM — all companies that have made statements to employees or the public signaling retrenchment on DEI — have kept a much lower profile while asking shareholders to reject similar proposals. The government’s next steps remain a crucial unknown for corporate America, and the uncertainty has left lawyers at top firms guessing — and their phone lines busy. Employment “law used to be more about looking at the different court cases and giving your advice about what a court is likely to do,” said Leen, the K&L Gates lawyer and former government official. “When you have a very active administration, companies are more interested in what the administration might do than what a court might rule down the line.” Photo: A protest at Harvard University in 2023.

Title: Nvidia isn’t just building AI chips — it’s building an AI-powered world

If you missed Nvidia’s (NVDA) keynote at Computex 2025, here’s the short version: AI is no longer just a tool — it’s the infrastructure of the future. Robots, desktops, smart cities, physics engines, and even national computing grids — all of it, Nvidia says, will be built on artificial intelligence. Speaking in Taipei at Asia’s largest electronics expo, CEO Jensen Huang laid out a sweeping vision of the company’s future — one where Nvidia isn’t just enabling AI, it’s helping build a world run by it. Leading the announcements was the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer built for individual developers, researchers, and students. Think of it as a desktop-sized version of Nvidia’s massive Blackwell-based systems, with enough power to train and fine-tune large AI models locally — no cloud access required. It’s the plug-and-play engine for what Huang called “AI-native” users — those who want high-performance AI development at their fingertips. Major OEMs such as Dell (DELL), ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, and Gigabyte are already lined up to offer Spark systems tailored for different segments of the market. That’s just one node in Nvidia’s broader push toward what Huang calls “AI factories” — purpose-built computing environments where massive amounts of data are processed and AI-based systems are created, refined, and deployed. To support this expansive vision, Nvidia launched something Huang said was “very special” and “one incredible ingredient” that has been missing: NVLink Fusion, an initiative that allows its GPUs to work seamlessly with third-party CPUs and custom AI chips. That means companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Fujitsu, Marvell (MRVL), and Alchip Technologies can plug into Nvidia’s ecosystem — a notable shift for a company long known for its tightly integrated stacks. “I’ll let all of our partners price it for themselves, but one thing’s for sure: Everybody can have one for Christmas,” Huang said. But this wasn’t just a cloud-computing conversation. It was one about bringing AI into the physical world. Nvidia doubled down on “physical AI” — the idea that machines should understand and interact with the laws of the real world. Huang talked about Isaac Groot N1 (announced in March), which is a foundational model for robotics that gives humanoid robots the ability to reason, plan, and perceive their surroundings. “The age of generalist robotics has arrived with breakthroughs in mechatronics, physical AI, and embedded computing — just in time as labor shortages limit worldwide industrial growth,” Huang said. One challenge in robotics today is data scarcity, especially high-quality, physical interaction data. Nvidia hopes to answer this problem with Cosmos, a photorealistic simulator that creates synthetic data by observing human behavior in virtual environments. Isaac Groot N1, combined with Cosmos, means developers could now create massive amounts of training data in virtual worlds before rolling out systems in the real one. Developers can now use Groot Dreams — a tool built on Cosmos — to create “future world states,” Huang said, by prompting the model with new tasks and images. This makes it possible to simulate millions of training scenarios before deploying robots in the real world. To help ground those dreams in physical reality, Nvidia will use the recently announced Newton, an open-source physics engine built in collaboration with Google DeepMind (GOOGL) and Disney Research (DIS) that will be open sourced in July. It’s designed to help AI systems understand real-world dynamics such as gravity, collisions, and torque — bridging the gap between code and physical context. “It’s incredible what it can do,” Huang said. “It’s completely GPU accelerated. It’s differentiable, so you could learn from experience. It is incredibly high fidelity.” Meanwhile, Nvidia is planting deeper roots in Asia with Nvidia Constellation, a new AI-focused hub in Taipei’s Beitou Shilin Science Park. It’s a strategic play — tapping into Taiwan’s world-class semiconductor ecosystem while deepening Nvidia’s presence in the global AI supply chain. Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, attended Huang’s keynote and later told reporters that the city fully supports Nvidia’s plans and is ready to offer whatever help is needed. One of the most strategically significant announcements came near the close of Huang’s keynote: a joint effort to build a national AI supercomputer in Taiwan. Nvidia will partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) (TSMC), Foxconn, and the Taiwanese government to create a cutting-edge AI system for the island. This project aims to integrate AI deeply into urban infrastructure, transforming cities such as Taipei into smart ecosystems powered by advanced computing. The initiative underscores Nvidia’s goal of embedding AI — and thus, its products — into the fabric of daily life, from autonomous vehicles to intelligent public services. Huang’s overall message was unmistakable: AI is no longer just software. It’s infrastructure. It’s automation. It’s everywhere. And Nvidia wants to not only build just the silicon — it wants to build but the systems, the software, and the global footprint to power it all. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Crypto ETPs see $785M in weekly inflows, AUM nears record high
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-etps-see-785m-in-weekly-inflows-aum-nears-record-high/

Digital asset investment products managed by firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares drew in $785 million of net inflows globally last week, marking the fifth consecutive week of gains, according to data from CoinShares. The latest inflows have pushed year-to-date figures to $7.5 billion, surpassing the previous high of $7.2 billion set in early February. “It also fully recovers the near $7 billion of outflows experienced during the February-March price correction,” CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote in a report published Monday. Source: CoinShares While Bitcoin-related products continued to attract the most capital, with $557 million in inflows, Ethereum-based funds saw a notable rebound. Ethereum products registered $205 million in inflows last week, bringing the year-to-date total to $575 million. Butterfill described Ethereum as the “standout performer” for the week, citing renewed investor confidence following the Pectra upgrade and the appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as co-executive director. However, only $41.8 million of those Ethereum inflows came from US-listed spot ETFs, highlighting mixed sentiment across markets. Bitcoin traded in a narrow range between $102,000 and $105,000 during the week, while Ether declined about 3%. Total assets under management across crypto investment products stood at $172.9 billion, close to record highs. Despite the strong weekly inflow, Bitcoin products saw a decline from the $887 million recorded in the previous week. Butterfill attributed the slowdown to ongoing hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million in inflows, marking their fourth straight week of gains. US-based crypto investment products led inflows with $681 million, followed by Germany at $86.3 million and Hong Kong at $24.2 million — the latter’s highest since November 2024. In contrast, Sweden, Canada, and Brazil registered outflows of $16.3 million, $13.5 million, and $3.9 million, respectively. Among altcoins, XRP and Sui recorded inflows of $5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink saw smaller positive movements. Solana-based funds were the only segment to report net outflows last week, with $0.9 million withdrawn.

Title: China's Xiaomi will spend $7 billion on homegrown chips amid the trade war

China’s Xiaomi will invest at least $6.9 billion over the next decade to develop its own semiconductor chips, the company announced Monday. CEO Lei Jun made the announcement in a post on the Chinese social media site Weibo. He said the tech giant is “well aware of the difficulty of chip manufacturing,” but it has “formulated a long-term and continuous investment plan: at least ten years of investment, at least 50 billion yuan, steady and steady, step by step.” The first chip, the Xring 01, will be unveiled at a company event on May 22. Xiaomi previously started making its own chips beginning in 2014, unveiling them three years later, but the project was eventually scrapped due to a number of setbacks. The new chip initiative began in 2021, Lei wrote Monday. “Xiaomi has always had a ‘chip dream’ because, in order to become a great hard-core technology company, chips are a peak that must be climbed and a tough battle that cannot be avoided,” he said. The company will manufacture integrated chips for use with its own smartphones. Apple (AAPL) popularized the so-called system-on-a-chip (SoC) process, which combines essential functions on a single circuit to save space and power. Apple’s in-house chip designs have helped it remain dominant in the tech space. Xiaomi has relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm (QCOM) and Taiwan’s MediaTek for chips, according to Business Insider. Qualcomm will reportedly continue to do so, yet stock was down about 1% Monday morning. The move makes Xiaomi the latest Chinese tech firm to focus on developing its own chips amid the U.S.-China trade war. In April, Huawei announced that it was getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA). In addition to the tariffs placed on China by President Trump last month, the U.S. has been restricting chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms for years in an effort to curb the country’s advancements with AI chip technology. The approach has hurt business for U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, which previously sold components to many Chinese firms.

BounceBit, a crypto infrastructure provider using features from both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), has executed a bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trading strategy using BlackRock's yield-generating tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to enhance returns. The strategy, to be rolled out to institutions and retail users, consisted of two main components: a bitcoin basis trade, involving a long position in the spot market while shorting futures, and a short position in BTC put options, both collateralized by BUIDL tokens. The basis trade, also known as cash and carry arbitrage, alone generated an annualized yield of 4.7%, with put option writing contributing an additional 15%. Combined with the 4.25% return from BUIDL used as collateral, the total yield exceeded 24%. Integrating BUIDL as collateral helped generate a higher return than strategies collateralized by stablecoins, which do not generate any return. "This strategy allows investors to capture both Treasury Bill yields and funding rate arbitrage returns," Jack Lu, founder and CEO of BounceBit said in a press release exclusively shared with CoinDesk. "BounceBit bridges the gap between Western real-world asset issuers and Asian crypto trading infrastructure, providing new options for yield generation," Lu said. BounceBit is the native BTC restaking chain secured by staking both bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. The network allows BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem and a CeFi-like mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital. As of writing, cryptocurrencies worth over $500 million were locked on BounceBit. BounceBit plans to roll out the BUIDL-collateralised strategy to institutional and retail users soon. "The successful pilot is a proof of concept to our new product line BB Prime, which will be available to both retail and institutional users," BounceBit's spokesperson told CoinDesk. "This strategy underpins BB Prime as a new class of CeDeFi applications built on top of RWAs which are traditionally troubled by a lack of utilities beyond just holding for t-bill yield, hindering mass adoption," the spokesperson added. BUIDL, launched in March 2024 by Securitize and BlackRock, is a tokenized investment fund operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos and Polygon. The token, currently boasting a market cap of $2.88 billion, is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds, boasting a stable value pegged at one dollar per token. Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

May 19, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Big Tech's great flattening is happening because it's out of options

Welcome back! In case you missed it, our new newsletter, Tech Memo, written by the great Alistair Barr, launched on Friday. Check out the first edition here. And if you aren't already, subscribe here. In today's big story, we're looking at Big Tech's obsession with cutting out middle managers and flattening their orgs. What's on deck Markets: When companies like Facebook and Zillow IPO, they turn to this man Tech: How one of the hottest coding startups almost died. Business: Gen Z is turning to blue-collar jobs. But first, no longer stuck in the middle. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Technology can quickly become outdated, but it's a job title in tech that's an endangered species: the middle manager. Big Tech is flattening its ranks to thin out layers of management in a bid to reduce bureaucracy, writes Emma Cosgrove, Tim Paradis, Eugene Kim, and Ashley Stewart. Middle managers have had to keep their heads on a swivel for a while. At the end of last year, BI's workplace expert Aki Ito detailed Corporate America falling out of love with the role. But the tech industry has taken the trend into overdrive, as is often the case. From Microsoft to Intel and Amazon, companies are shedding managers to make themselves as quick and lean as possible. The biggest immediate impact of flattening orgs is managers overseeing more workers. Some argue that will limit micromanagement. Others say you'll burn out the managers who are left behind. Big Tech is willing to take its chances, though. As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last fall: "I hate bureaucracy." "The goal again is to allow us to have higher ownership and to move more quickly," Jassy added. Big Tech's middle-management purge speaks to a larger trend: Let the stars shine and get rid of anyone else. Part of tech companies' efficiency push is to identify top performers and weed out underachievers. With that approach, you could argue there is less of a need for managers. No weak links in the chain means managers don't have to do as much hand-holding. Get out of the way and let your top performers do what they do best. This isn't a foolproof strategy, though. Someone being extremely capable at their job doesn't always correlate with them being an easy employee to manage. In fact, sometimes the opposite can be true. But what other options do these tech giants have? The pressure from startups like OpenAI and Anthropic is undeniable. Their smaller size also gives them a massive leg up to move quickly. And when it comes to AI, speed is the name of the game. Meanwhile, middle managers seem to only be slowing companies down. 1. Trump's "Big, beautiful bill" could cause some big chaos. Market pros say the president's tax bill would add $4 trillion to the US deficit, stoking mayhem in the bond market. That means another Trump vs. bond market showdown could be headed our way. 2. Bankers tell startups wanting to go public: "Go, go, go." Startups like Hinge Health put their IPO plans on hold when Trump introduced sweeping tariffs. Now that the stock market has recovered, bankers are telling companies to go public while they still can. 3. This "hick from Ohio" is a big deal for IPOs. Pat Healy could be the forefather of getting stock exchanges to compete for the right to get a company to list with them. From free Davos advertising to NFL star appearances, here's how Healy lands companies major marketing perks. 1. "Appstinence" is a virtue. Raised in the age of the smartphone, a growing cohort of people, mostly millennials and Gen Zers, are opting for dumb tech instead. As the evidence of our collective phone addiction adds up, even tech lovers are embracing the digital detox movement. 2. How Silicon Valley's favorite startup came back from the edge of disaster. StackBlitz was at death's door when Anthropic released its AI model Sonnet 3.5 in 2024. That led StackBlitz to create Bolt.new, a product that could write code based on prompts written in English — and the company's gold mine. BI's Alistair Barr has the full story. 3. Is AI coming for teachers? Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn thinks so. On a recent podcast appearance, he told venture capitalist Sarah Guo that schools will still be necessary in an AI-driven future — but mostly just for childcare. He thinks AI will do the actual teaching. 1. Gen Z is dyeing white collars blue. The cost of college is skyrocketing, and the white-collar job market is unstable. That's led many young people to turn to trades instead, which can offer six-figure salaries and have a high demand for workers. 2. Selling a merger to Trump? MAGA-ify it. Cable giant Charter is merging with Cox, posing a bigger rival for Comcast. The merger still needs the green light from the Trump administration, and it seems like Charter is leaning into pro-American rhetoric to get it, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 3. LA investor Jessica Mah is in a legal battle with DGV investor Justin Caldbeck and two ex-employees. In a lawsuit, Mah has accused Caldbeck of sexually harassing her, which he denies. The lawsuits against Mah, meanwhile, accuse her of misusing company funds, harassment, and age discrimination, BI's Rob Price reports.

Title: US-Sino AI Rivalry Enters ‘Competitive Coexistence’ After Tariff Truce

ByVivian Toh ByVivian Toh, Contributor. The U.S. and China strike a 90-day tariff agreement. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty ... More Images) Wall Street and Shanghai markets may have cheered the U.S.-China tariff détente, but beneath the surface optimism lies a profound strategic recalibration of the world’s most consequential technological rivalry. The May 12 agreement, a 90-day suspension of escalating tariffs, has seen U.S. duties on Chinese imports plummet dramatically, from an aggressive 145% down to a more moderate 30%, while China reciprocated by reducing tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%. This temporary peace, however, signals not an end to hostilities but a new phase defined by careful maneuvering and intense strategic rivalry, aptly termed "competitive coexistence." Influential Chinese commentator Ren Yi, widely known as Chairman Rabbit, encapsulated Beijing’s view by describing the tariff truce as a "beautiful counterattack." In a widely circulated WeChat post, Ren portrayed the agreement as a pragmatic victory against the Trump administration’s "impulsive paper-tiger tactics," underscoring China's long-term strategic acumen and disciplined approach in contrast to America's more reactive stance. His narrative resonated deeply with domestic Chinese audiences, reflecting Beijing’s confidence in its strategic positioning amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Yet, beyond political narratives, global financial markets have demonstrated notable resilience. After the initial tariff announcement on April 9 triggered widespread anxiety, markets had already begun to recalibrate expectations by the time the two nations officially announced the truce. From April 9 to May 12, technology stocks notably benefited from investor confidence in the resilience and adaptability of major firms. Alibaba led the charge with a remarkable 25.5% rise in its share price, followed closely by Tencent with a 17.3% increase and Baidu’s 13.3% gain. U.S. tech giants also shared in the relief rally: Meta’s shares surged by 9.2% and Apple’s by 6%, although Alphabet’s stock experienced a modest decline, reflecting lingering investor concerns about its international regulatory exposure and vulnerabilities in key global markets. Share price of U.S. and China tech giants before and after the tariff truce. This market adjustment represents more than mere optimism — it highlights a deeper shift in investor psychology. Geopolitical tensions are no longer seen as isolated threats but strategic inflection points demanding corporate agility and adaptability. Investors increasingly expect firms to navigate geopolitical uncertainties effectively, turning potential disruptions into opportunities for strategic recalibration. Central to this recalibration is the intense race for artificial intelligence dominance. American companies like Meta and Microsoft are vigorously expanding AI capabilities through advanced cloud services, partnerships and product innovations. Meta's strong growth reflects increasing demand for its AI-powered ad tools and content creation services, which have significantly enhanced user targeting and engagement. Microsoft, meanwhile, continues to integrate OpenAI’s cutting-edge technologies into its Azure cloud platform, seeking to set global standards in enterprise AI solutions. Chinese tech giants are equally aggressive, accelerating development of self-contained AI ecosystems in response to tightening U.S. restrictions, including export controls on advanced AI chips and critical technologies. Tencent, for instance, reported robust financial results in Q1 2025, with revenues climbing 13% year-on-year to RMB 180 billion ($25.1 billion). This growth was fueled primarily by its Value-Added Services segment, including blockbuster games such as Honour of Kings and Delta Force, as well as AI-driven marketing enhancements on platforms like Weixin Search. Despite substantial investments in AI, Tencent managed an 18% rise in operating profits to RMB 69.3 billion ($9.7 billion), underlining its capacity to balance strategic investments with profitability. Meanwhile, China’s strategic pivot toward domestic technological innovation has been particularly evident in AI infrastructure development. Initiatives like Baidu’s PaddlePaddle and Alibaba’s ModelScope illustrate a determined push to build sovereign technological stacks capable of competing independently of foreign technologies. The broader geopolitical context, especially U.S. export controls and the rescinding of the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule — replaced with targeted restrictions — has galvanized China’s resolve to innovate autonomously. The strategic realignment also underscores broader shifts in global supply chains, with U.S. companies actively diversifying manufacturing and production away from China to hedge against future geopolitical shocks. Apple epitomizes this approach through its accelerated expansion in alternative manufacturing hubs like India and Vietnam — a strategy known as “China+1.” However, despite these tactical shifts, China’s entrenched role in global manufacturing, bolstered by its extensive supplier networks, skilled workforce and manufacturing efficiencies, renders complete decoupling unrealistic and economically disruptive. Capital and talent flows have similarly been reshaped by geopolitical tensions. Chinese firms now face increasing obstacles when attempting to access foreign investment or public markets. Heightened scrutiny of researchers’ visas and the politicization of academic collaborations have further complicated talent acquisition. Nevertheless, both China and the U.S. continue to significantly ramp up domestic investments. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act channels substantial federal funds into semiconductor and AI research, aiming to safeguard technological leadership. China mirrors these efforts with extensive initiatives bolstering technology zones, intensifying public-private partnerships and prioritizing STEM education nationwide. The resulting environment is one of strategic caution combined with sustained competitive aggression — a delicate equilibrium captured by the term "competitive coexistence." Companies must adeptly navigate a dual reality of collaboration and competition, reflecting a fragmented yet interconnected global technology landscape. In this new paradigm, the defining contest between the U.S. and China transcends tariff skirmishes. Instead, the battlefield extends to innovation, scalability and influence over international technological standards. This truce thus provides not only temporary economic relief but also a moment of clarity, spotlighting the relentless drive of both superpowers toward long-term technological supremacy. The markets, now more accustomed to such dynamics, perceive geopolitical frictions as persistent realities that demand continuous strategic foresight and adaptability.

Title: Why META Stock Is A Prime Choice In The AI Boom

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/18: In this photo illustration, the Meta AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why pay a premium of 35 times earnings for Microsoft stock when Meta stock is available at 25 times earnings? This seems particularly questionable when considering the following three key factors: Meta isn't exactly a safe haven investment. To illustrate this, consider how Meta's stock has reacted during past market shocks: it experienced a significant 77% decline during the 2022 inflation shock, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of only 25% for the S&P 500. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Meta’s stock fell by 35%, while the S&P 500 saw a comparable decline of 34%. These instances suggest that Meta is not a particularly "safe" stock. Also, see Buy or Sell Meta Stock. Furthermore, it has already seen substantial gains this year, rising 7%, and a remarkable 32% in just one month, climbing from around $485 on April 21st to $640 currently. On the other hand, for a more balanced perspective, consider the Trefis High Quality strategy, which has outperformed the market with over 91% returns since its inception, as demonstrated in the HQ performance metrics. Confident in the long-term potential of the AI revolution? Meta Platforms presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its unique position. Unlike companies solely focused on AI development, Meta integrates AI across its massive and growing user base. The daily active people (DAP) across Meta's family of apps have grown by an impressive 16%, from 2.95 billion in 2022 to 3.43 billion currently. This vast engagement provides a distinct advantage in monetizing AI advancements through enhanced advertising, content recommendations, and overall user experience. A substantial portion of the company's revenue is directly generated from ad sales on its key platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, making AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and delivery particularly impactful. Supported by significant investments in AI research and development, and leveraging this unparalleled global social media network, Meta is strategically positioned to capitalize on AI growth, regardless of the dominant technologies that emerge. Despite its compelling advantages, investing in Meta is not without risks. A key concern is the potential for earnings to fall short of expectations or for sales growth to decelerate from 22% in the past year to a possible 15% in the near future. This slowdown could be driven by broader economic headwinds, where businesses might reduce advertising expenditures to preserve capital, particularly in the event of slowing economic growth or a recession. Furthermore, unforeseen or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock’s performance. Consequently, investors should be prepared for the possibility of significant declines, potentially reaching 50% or more. Selling during such downturns could be detrimental to long-term returns. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider consulting a financial advisor with experience navigating multiple bear markets. They can provide insights into strategies like the Trefis HQ strategy and other prudent approaches to potentially capitalize on market downturns. Remember, substantial wealth can be generated in such environments by maintaining a rational perspective. Considering these factors, if you are a long-term investor with a 3-to-5-year horizon and a buy-and-hold strategy, Meta could present an interesting entry point at its current valuation, even after its recent price increase.

Speaking at the Computex trade show, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that Nvidia will work with Taiwan’s government and Foxconn’s Big Innovation Group to construct the new system, which will house over 10,000 of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell GPUs. The supercomputer will be deployed at the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC) and support Taiwan’s leading academic institutions and Nvidia’s key chip partner, TSMC, as per a company statement on Monday. “We are growing beyond the limits of our current office [in Taiwan],” Huang said, debuting concept footage of the company’s upcoming “Constellation” HQ, designed to resemble a spacecraft landed in Taipei’s Beitou district. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes tech firms to onshore manufacturing, rolling back Biden-era export restrictions while cracking down on AI chip sales to China. Nvidia has pledged to invest $500 billion in U.S. infrastructure, but Monday’s announcements show the company’s deep dependence on Taiwan’s supply chain and scientific institutions. According to Nvidia, the new system will deliver more than eight times the AI performance of the existing Taiwania 2. It will feature HGX H200 nodes, Blackwell Ultra-based B300 systems, and GB200 NVL72 racks, all connected via Nvidia’s Quantum InfiniBand networking. “The new NCHC supercomputer will drive breakthroughs in sovereign AI, quantum computing, and advanced scientific computation,” said NCHC Director General Chau-Lyan Chang. Among the projects it will power TAIDE, a national effort to build large language models tuned to Taiwanese culture and language; a generative AI development platform called Taiwan AI RAP; and simulations in climate modeling, quantum chemistry, and epidemic prevention. Nvidia’s CUDA-Q platform has already enabled researchers to run a record-breaking 784-qubit quantum simulation, according to the statement. A new hybrid quantum-classical computing system is also in development. The Taiwan rollout follows Huang’s recent trip through the Gulf with President Trump, where Saudi Arabia committed to a $600 billion investment package spanning AI, energy, and infrastructure. As part of that initiative, Nvidia agreed to supply at least 18,000 Blackwell GPUs to power “Humain,” a state-backed Saudi AI firm developing a 500-megawatt data center. The company also unveiled NVLink Fusion, a new effort to let rival AI chips connect directly to Nvidia’s platform, aimed at locking its GPUs into the backbone of next-gen AI systems. “Nothing gives me more joy than when you buy everything from Nvidia ... but it gives me tremendous joy if you just buy something from Nvidia,” he said. Nvidia (NVDA) is currently trading at $135.40, up 0.42% on the day, per Google Finance data.

Title: Hired-Hand Billionaires 2025: These 48 Executives Got Rich Working For Others

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. Most billionaires got rich by building businesses or inheriting big bucks from someone who did. Yet a small but growing group of current and former American executives have managed to amass three-comma fortunes as very well-paid employees. Altogether, Forbes found a record 48 of these hired-hand billionaires in 2025, up from 29 a year ago. And that count is sure to keep climbing thanks to soaring share prices and sky-high executive pay packages. The average annual compensation of the ten highest-paid CEOs in America shot up more than sevenfold from $46 million per year in 2010 to a peak of $330 million per year in 2021, according to data firm Equilar. Most Americans build their wealth through a salary or hourly wage, but top execs are often paid in stock options and other share awards that vest over several years and are often tied to performance. And that’s increasingly the case, with the average equity component of CEO pay packages growing from 54% in 2012 to 66% in 2023, per executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. That’s helped the best-paid CEOs in the U.S. keep getting richer, even as the average pay of the top ten chief executives has actually fallen post-Covid, to a still-enviable $125 million per year in 2023, the most recent year for which full data is available. Because the stock market has continued to climb, with the S&P 500 up nearly 370% since 2010 and nearly 25% since 2021, the value of the shares many of these executives were awarded in the past has skyrocketed, helping the rich get richer and making more companies big enough to birth non-founder billionaires than ever before. Back in 2010, only seven of America’s 403 billionaires were hired-hands, accounting for just 2% of the country’s richest people. That included six former executives who are also on this year’s list: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, the two richest hired-hands by far today, as well as Jeff Skoll and Meg Whitman of eBay, John Brown of medical equipment maker Stryker and Hamilton “Tony” James of Blackstone. (The seventh, former Cisco CEO John Morgridge, has since fallen from the billionaire ranks.) Fifteen years later, hired-hand billionaires are still relatively rare, but their numbers have increased at a rate that outpaces the incredible growth of America’s three-comma club overall, suggesting that the ten-figure fortunes minted by these current and former non-founder executives aren’t just the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. Today, 5% of America’s nearly 900 billionaires are hired-hands, up from 4% when Forbes last counted them in February 2024, when there were nearly 760 U.S. billionaires. There are 18 newcomers in this year’s group, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, FICO CEO William Lansing, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell, former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, longtime Nvidia director Harvey Jones and Howard Lutnick, who left his role as chairman and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to become President Trump’s secretary of commerce in February. AMD CEO Lisa Su is the only hired-hand on last year’s list who failed to make the cut this year, as shares of the chipmaker she runs have cratered by nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, early Uber employee Ryan Graves and Bob Muglia, the former CEO of cloud-based database software firm Snowflake, have regained their billionaire status and returned to this year’s ranking after failing to make the 2024 list of hired-hands. Here are a few of the most notable newcomers on this year’s hired-hands list (net worths are as of May 13, 2025): Born and raised in Russia, Shikin joined marketing software and mobile game maker AppLovin as vice president of engineering when the company was founded in 2012. He was promoted to chief technology officer in 2020 and helped take the company public a year later. Shikin owes a big chunk of his fortune to a performance-based share award he was granted in 2023 that could only be fully unlocked if AppLovin’s stock price soared sixfold in five years. The company hit that once unfathomable goal by the third quarter of 2024, and the company’s market capitalization has skyrocketed by another 370% since to $125 billion, amid a frenzy for anything remotely AI-adjacent. Shikin owns a nearly 1% stake in AppLovin between his stock and options that is worth $1.6 billion. He is one of eight AppLovin billionaires, including fellow hired-hand Herald Chen. Winkelried joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 and rose to president and co-chief operating officer in 2006, alongside President Trump’s future chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn. When Winkelried retired three years later, he walked away with 1.5 million Goldman shares that would be worth nearly $900 million today with the bank’s shares soaring nearly sixfold since the end of March 2009, plus options to acquire another 1.1 million shares (though Forbes assumes that Winkelried likely diversified his holdings along the way, and a spokesperson declined to comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2015 to become co-CEO of TPG alongside the private equity giant’s billionaire cofounder Jim Coulter. Winkelried was promoted to sole CEO in 2021, when Coulter stepped back into his current role as executive chair, and the pair helped take TPG public in 2022 with the firm’s other billionaire cofounder David Bonderman (d. December 2024). TPG’s stock has soared by more than 50% since the IPO, and the 5% stake Winkelried has earned so far for his 10 years of service to the firm is now worth more than $950 million. Culp joined Danaher, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire brothers Mitchell and Steven Rales, in 1990 and rose to president and CEO in 2001. By the time he retired 14 years later, Culp had helped boost the company’s stock price by more than 500% and netted nearly $230 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting stock along the way. That left him with 1.7 million split-adjusted shares that would be worth nearly $350 million today with Danaher’s stock up more than 200% since, plus options to acquire another 2.9 million split-adjusted shares (though Forbes assumes that Culp likely diversified his holdings along the way, and his spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2018 to lead the turnaround of troubled General Electric as chairman and CEO. He has broken up the bloated conglomerate into three separate public companies after spinning off its healthcare business as GE HealthCare in 2023 and its energy business as GE Vernova in 2024. Shares of the original company, now known as GE Aerospace, have nearly quadrupled since Culp took over as CEO, earning him shares of all three companies that are worth more than $400 million combined. After nearly a decade at Google, Arora left for Japanese investment giant Softbank in 2014, where he was promoted to president and chief operating officer a year later and touted as the likely successor to the firm’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son. Things didn’t go as planned, and Arora resigned from his executive roles in 2016, though he remained at the company as an advisor for another year. He ended up cashing out at least $360 million (before tax) during his short stint at Softbank between his lucrative pay package and resignation agreement. He spent a year angel investing, then joined cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks as chairman and CEO in 2018. The firm, which was founded by an Israeli-American entrepreneur named Nir Zuk, who now serves as chief technology officer, in 2005 has seen its stock price soar nearly sixfold since Arora took over, making both him and Zuk billionaires. Arora has netted nearly $800 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting shares over the past two and a half years, leaving him with stock and options worth another $340 million. Brown is the longest-serving CEO of Motorola after the firm’s cofounder Paul Galvin (d. 1959) and his son Bob Galvin (d. 2011). Brown joined Motorola in 2003 and was promoted to chief executive in 2008. He spun off the company’s struggling legacy smartphone business as a separate public company called Motorola Mobility in 2011, and the Razr maker was acquired by Google for $12.5 billion a year later. (It’s now part of Lenovo.) Then, through a series of more than 50 acquisitions, Brown has transformed the company now known as Motorola Solutions into a nearly $70 billion (market capitalization) behemoth in the market for mission-critical public safety communications, 911 command center solutions and video security. The firm’s stock has soared more than sixfold since Brown took over, and he’s netted more than $700 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling shares along the way. He still owns Motorola Solutions stock and options worth a further $600 million. Baratta and Chae are two of five hired-hand billionaires from Blackstone, the nearly $180 billion (market capitalization) alternative asset management giant cofounded by billionaires Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson (d. 2018). Baratta joined Blackstone in 1998 and moved to London in 2001 to help build the firm’s European private equity business. He has served as global head of private equity since 2012. Chae joined Blackstone in 1997 and ran its international private equity business before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2015 and vice chairman in January. Blackstone’s stock is up nearly 15% over the past year, and Baratta and Chae each own shares worth nearly $1 billion. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, the software giant’s chairman and CEO is a billionaire for the first time. Nadella joined the tech giant in 1992 and rose to CEO in 2014, when America’s richest hired-hand billionaire, Steve Ballmer, retired that year. Nadella was named chairman in 2021, replacing veteran tech exec and investor John Thompson, who had assumed the role from Microsoft’s billionaire cofounder Bill Gates in 2014. Nadella has made Microsoft a major player in the AI boom, investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and leading the development of Microsoft’s own suite of AI-powered tools called CoPilot. He owns just 0.01% of the $3.4 trillion (market capitalization) company’s stock, but that’s just enough to make him a billionaire—when combined with his more than $600 million in (pretax) share sales.

May 19, 2025 05:20 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that the Elevance Health class action lawsuit – captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., No. 25-cv-00923 (S.D. Ind.) – seeks to represent purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock and charges Elevance Health as well as certain of Elevance Health’s executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-elevance-health-inc-class-action-lawsuit-elv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Elevance Health class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 11, 2025. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Elevance Health operates as a health benefits company. Among other things, the cost of providing health benefits to members is driven by the level of care a patient requires, often referred to as “acuity,” and the members’ utilization of the health benefits, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Medicaid redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance Health’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs; and (ii) this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance Health’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 17, 2024, Elevance Health revealed that it was now “expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint. Then, on October 17, 2024, the Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that Elevance Health announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that Elevance Health had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance Health further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 11%. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Elevance Health common stock during the class period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit.

Title: How President Trump is sparking a crypto revolution in America

By Rafael Nam President Trump addresses the Bitcoin 2024 conference at Music City Center in Nashville, Tenn., when he was still a candidate. Jon Cherry/Getty Images hide caption For years, crypto was viewed by many as a weird and fringe investment, hyped up by a bunch of math geeks and used widely by all kinds of unsavory characters, from drug dealers to hackers. It was known for spectacular returns — and spectacular crashes: Top crypto exchange FTX collapsed just two years ago, landing its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, in prison. Now, a radical shift is taking place under President Trump. From financial regulators to the halls of Congress and all the way to the Oval Office, the U.S. is fully embracing — and even promoting — crypto. It is a remarkable turnaround from the Biden administration. And crypto companies are emerging as big winners. On Monday, one of the top exchanges in the sector, Coinbase, is joining the S&P 500, the stock market index that tracks the biggest traded companies in the U.S. "I think it's a historic moment for the industry and it's a really special moment for Coinbase," says Faryar Shirzad, the company's chief policy officer. "Having Coinbase be the first crypto company that's on the S&P 500 and (to be) be in a position where more and more people are beginning to watch how we operate (and) what we do is really exciting for us." President Trump himself also stands to benefit financially. Shortly before his inauguration, he even launched his meme coin — a crypto asset known more for being tied to internet memes and jokes. And his family is getting into the action too with financial interests in crypto companies. Advocates of cryptocurrencies welcome the developments, believing the U.S. is finally embracing — and taking a global leadership role in promoting — an area they say will help define the future of the financial sector. But critics are aghast, warning that the U.S. is promoting an investment with a history of incredible volatility that will end up hurting scores of average Americans, potentially setting up a financial crisis like the one the world experienced in 2008. "History is going to show this will be a disaster courting a catastrophe for the rest of the country and especially for Main Street Americans, who are going to get stuck with the bill cleaning up after the next financial crash," says Dennis Kelleher, a prominent crypto critic at advocacy group Better Markets. Whatever anyone believes, however, one thing's clear: Trump has ushered in a new golden era for crypto. From Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 to the deep regulatory shifts, here are three ways to understand what's taking place in the crypto sector. Perhaps the most sweeping changes have taken place at the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mission is to police the financial sector and protect investors. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC aggressively went after the crypto sector, with lawsuits and enforcement including against top crypto companies such as Coinbase. Gensler, who stepped down early this year, called crypto "the Wild West." and sought to rein in the industry, comparing it to the period before the Great Crash of 1929 when the financial sector was dominated by "hucksters" and "fraudsters" before federal laws on securities were put in place. His approach set him up as an enemy for the sector as he sought to get companies such as Coinbase to register with the agency and comply with its regulations, despite protests from crypto companies that they shouldn't be considered part of traditional Wall Street. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler took a much more aggressive approach against crypto companies when he headed the agency. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption No longer. The agency has staged a remarkable turnaround starting even before the new SEC head Paul Atkins was sworn in last month. In one of the agency's biggest decisions, it dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase that accused the company of trying to operate outside of its purview. It reassigned its chief litigation counsel to a new role managing IT systems. (The SEC did not reply to a request for comment from NPR.) Crypto companies have welcomed the changes, calling them a needed readjustment from what they saw as excessive heavy-handedness under the Biden administration. And regulators such as the SEC and the country's law enforcement are not necessarily giving up on overseeing crypto altogether. Just this month the former founder and CEO of a crypto company called Celsius Network was sentenced to 12 years for fraud and market manipulation. Yet for consumer advocates, the changes are devastating. Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection at Consumer Federation of America says it's akin to letting "crypto run wild." It's also personal for Frayer, who was at the SEC for more than three years. "It is very frustrating to see three years of, you know, 65, 70-hour weeks that me and my team worked to try and protect investors and get this industry compliant with the law, be erased in essentially three months," Frayer says. "And it is surprising to see, given the risks that it creates for the traditional financial system." When crypto exchange FTX collapsed, many analysts thought at the time that it would permanently tarnish crypto, validating warnings by critics about the dangers of the industry. Instead, something remarkable happened: Crypto has gone legit. By early 2024, BlackRock, one of the biggest financial firms in Wall Street, was the first to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, offering investors — including mom and pop ones — an easier way to invest in the cryptocurrencies. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried arrives for a bail hearing at Manhattan Federal Court in New York City on Aug. 11, 2023. When the crypto exchange collapsed, many thought it would permanently tarnish the crypto sector. It's done anything but. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption Super PACs representing crypto companies spent over $100 million in the 2024 election cycle, helping elect lawmakers they view as friendlier to the crypto industry to Congress. And now, Coinbase is set to become part of the S&P 500 starting at the open of trade on Monday, replacing Discover Financial Services, which is being acquired by Capital One Financial. "Coinbase joining the S&P 500 means crypto is here to stay. It's going to be in everybody's 401(k), everybody is going to have crypto exposure at least indirectly through Coinbase," said Brian Armstrong, the company's CEO, in an interview with Yahoo Finance. As crypto goes increasingly mainstream, another person stands to benefit directly: President Trump himself. Trump's launch of his meme coin sparked controversy even within the crypto industry, which sees it as a distraction that could undermine the credibility of the industry. Although $TRUMP lost a substantial part of its value since launching, President Trump sent the price of the coin soaring for a while when he announced he would hold a special dinner this Thursday for the top 220 holders of the meme coin as measured during a three-week period that ended earlier this month. That has sparked accusations that investors, including from abroad, rushed to buy Trump's currency as a way to influence the president. And it goes beyond meme coins. Members of the Trump family are also in. His sons are involved in crypto ventures that are reportedly exploring financial deals with major crypto companies as well as foreign-backed entities. President Trump's son, Eric Trump, who's an executive at the Trump Organization, participates in the Token 2049 crypto conference in Dubai on May 1. Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Ultimately, all the changes that are taking place under President Trump have consumer advocates concerned that it will end in a crisis similar in scope to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. There are similarities, according to crypto critics. Back then, financial firms peddled complex financial investments with elaborate names like credit default swaps or collateralized debt obligations — investments that few understood and turned out to be a house of cards that collapsed and dragged the global financial system down with them. "You have these predatory instruments that come into the marketplace. They're advertised as innovations. They're advertised as serving low-income communities or middle-class Americans. And at the end of the day, they blow up," consumer advocate Frayer says. "The companies that foisted them upon Americans get bailed out or do fine, and everyone else is left holding the bag. So I am afraid this is like 2008 all over again." An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that President Trump has invited the top 220 holders of his namesake memecoin for dinner this Wednesday. The dinner is on Thursday.

Title: CE 100 Index Jumps 5% as Shopify Gets a Post-Earnings Bump; Payment Brands Rally

A rally across all market indices, as China-focused tariffs were reduced, helped lift the CE 100 Index 5% higher in a week that saw almost all pillars advance, with the exception of the “Be Well” segment. In the Shop vertical, up 7%, Shopify surged 20.3% to take the lead among gainers for the week. Shopify’s first-quarter earnings results showed double-digit growth in gross merchandise volumes (GMV) and a continued movement toward streamlined checkout online and further inroads made in offline commerce. “It’s still early to assess the full impact of the current trade environment,” Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said on the conference call with analysts. He added that “We’re, of course, monitoring for potential slowdowns, but our data through April shows little evidence of that.” The company’s earnings results noted that revenues were up 27% to $2.4 billion; GMV surged 22% to $74.8 billion. Offline GMV increased 23% and B2B GMV delivered triple-digit growth, up 109% from the year-ago first quarter, Finkelstein said. Tencent took the Pay and Be Paid segment up 6.9%. In its own quarterly report, Tencent’s CEO noted that its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities had “contributed tangibly” to its gaming and advertising businesses. Revenue was up 13% year over year to 180 billion yuan ($25 billion). “We also stepped up our spending on new AI opportunities, such as the Yuanbao application and AI in Weixin,” CEO Ma Huateng said, referring to the company’s super app. Domestic Games revenues were 42.9 billion yuan, representing a 24% year-over-year increase from last year. Tencent shares were 18% higher. Also within the payments sphere, Affirm’s stock gained 13.2%. Affirm is partnering with Costco to offer online shoppers the option to pay over time for transactions. Customers, if approved, will be able to select monthly Affirm payment plans when shopping on Costco’s website. Also within the payments pantheon, PayPal’s stock was up 2.7%. The company’s shares rose in the wake of news that AI search company Perplexity has launched a partnership with PayPal. The collaboration will see Perplexity use PayPal to power agentic commerce on its Perplexity Pro platform. Beginning this summer, U.S. consumers can check out instantly using PayPal or Venmo when they ask Perplexity to look for products, book travel or purchase tickets, per the announcement. As for the payment networks themselves, Visa and Mastercard gained a respective 3.6% and 2.6%. As detailed by PYMNTS, a group of trade associations representing European retailers reportedly asked the European Commission to take action against Mastercard and Visa under European Union antitrust rules, alleging that the companies charge high fees and don’t provide transparency on those fees. In a letter, the associations also called for price controls on interchange fees, transparency and nondiscriminatory obligations for International Card Schemes, and a tool for regulators to scrutinize ICSs’ actions. A Visa spokesperson told PYMNTS the firm’s fees reflect the value of its services, adding: “This includes extremely high levels of security and fraud prevention, near-perfect operational resilience and reliability, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality, innovative products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs.” The Be Well segment was the only decliner, slipping 1.1% as United Healthcare plunged 23%. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth Group for possible criminal Medicare fraud related to its Medicare Advantage business.

The company’s shares rose in the wake of news that AI search company Perplexity has launched a partnership with PayPal. The collaboration will see Perplexity use PayPal to power agentic commerce on its Perplexity Pro platform. Beginning this summer, U.S. consumers can check out instantly using PayPal or Venmo when they ask Perplexity to look for products, book travel or purchase tickets, per the announcement. As for the payment networks themselves, Visa and Mastercard gained a respective 3.6% and 2.6%. As detailed by PYMNTS, a group of trade associations representing European retailers reportedly asked the European Commission to take action against Mastercard and Visa under European Union antitrust rules, alleging that the companies charge high fees and don’t provide transparency on those fees. In a letter, the associations also called for price controls on interchange fees, transparency and nondiscriminatory obligations for International Card Schemes, and a tool for regulators to scrutinize ICSs’ actions. A Visa spokesperson told PYMNTS the firm’s fees reflect the value of its services, adding: “This includes extremely high levels of security and fraud prevention, near-perfect operational resilience and reliability, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality, innovative products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs.” The Be Well segment was the only decliner, slipping 1.1% as United Healthcare plunged 23%.

Title: Legendary investor Ron Baron shares the early contrarian lesson that's helped him return 1,843% over 22 years

It's hard to imagine Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital, knowing little about investing. Baron is one of the most successful investors of his time, amassing more than $41 billion in assets under management since 1982. His Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) is up 1,843% since launching in May 2003, trouncing the S&P 500's 536% return and beating 99% of similar funds over the last 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar data. But like all of us, he was once a beginner, too. After studying chemistry and then attending law school, Baron finally decided he wanted to work in finance. With no job offer, he moved into a friend's basement in New Jersey until he could find work. His engineer parents weren't happy. But his uncle bought him a copy of Joseph E. Granville's "A Strategy Of Daily Stock Market Timing For Maximum Profit." Reading it, Baron learned his first major lesson about investing: taking a contrarian approach to prevailing market consensus can pay off. "What made sense in this book, which was not intuitive, was that when news was really bad, you're supposed to invest, you're supposed to buy things," Baron told the Economic Club of New York on May 13. "And when news was really good, you're supposed to sell things." Essentially, don't chase returns on the back end of rallies when all the good news is already priced in. It's time-tested advice that many investing legends espouse. Warren Buffett's famous mantra was to "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Sir John Templeton wrote: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." Investor sentiment has been all over the place in recent weeks. After President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement, investors became exceptionally bearish on stocks. A month ago, CNN's Fear and Greed Index was in "Extreme Fear" territory. But the outlook has improved as Trump has started to back off from his trade war. Right now, "Greed" is the dominant feeling among investors. Today, Baron is uber-bullish on Tesla, saying he believes its share price will grow 10x from current levels. The stock makes up 35% of his Baron Partners Fund. While Baron doesn't trade short-term macro developments, instead betting on companies he thinks will outperform over the long term, he still applies the lesson he learned early in his career by being ahead of the consensus on the stocks he buys and seeing future outcomes that no one else sees. "It's about being the opposite of what everyone else says," he said. And when things are going awry in markets and the economy, Baron stays cool and thinks about the big picture. "I just figure like John Lennon that in the long run, everything's going to work out. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end yet," he said. "Sooner or later, everything works out. Man causes problems and then fixes the problems." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to

Title: China remains committed to high-level opening up

Time Published: 2025-05-19T07:42:42Z
Full Content:

(Photo by Wu Wenjun/People's Daily Online) The recently concluded 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, saw the participation of 288,000 overseas buyers from 219 countries and regions. On-site intended export deals reached $25.44 billion, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent. Multiple indicators hit record highs, underscoring China's determination to share its development opportunities with the world through high-level opening up. At a time when globalization is facing headwinds and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, China is opening its door wider to the world, providing much-needed stability and certainty to the global economy. Opening up to the world is the fundamental national policy of China that has endured throughout more than four decades of reform and opening up. This long-standing commitment remains a vital pathway for China to pursue its own development while contributing to global prosperity. By promoting development through opening up, China has been widely recognized as an oasis of certainty and a hot spot for investment and entrepreneurship. China's high-level opening up is a continuous effort rather than a completed mission. Actively expanding imports is also a key part of this strategy. China does not deliberately pursue a trade surplus. It is working to foster more balanced trade by actively increasing imports. In 2024, the total value of China's imports reached 18.4 trillion yuan ($2.55 trillion), up 2.3 percent year on year, setting a new record. The country has maintained its position as the world's second-largest importer for 16 consecutive years. Photo taken on April 19, 2025 shows crowds of people visiting the 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair. (Photo by Huang Taiming/People's Daily Online) The China International Import Expo (CIIE) is the globe's first national-level exposition dedicated to imports, demonstrating China's commitment to opening its market and advancing trade liberalization and economic globalization. From hosting international cooperation platforms such as the CIIE, Canton Fair, China International Fair for Trade in Services, China International Consumer Products Expo, and China International Supply Chain Expo, to promoting the brand of "Invest in China" and launching the "Shopping in China" series, China is providing broad development opportunities for global companies with a spirit of openness. Meanwhile, it has given all the least developed countries with which it has diplomatic relations zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. With these ongoing efforts, the enormous Chinese market is turning into a shared global market, demonstrating China's sense of responsibility as a major country. China's determination to expand high-level opening up remains unwavering. This is not only a clear position but also evident in concrete actions. In the first quarter of this year, 12,603 new foreign-invested enterprises were established in China, representing a year-on-year growth of 4.3 percent. Meanwhile, China has removed all market access restrictions for foreign investors in the manufacturing sector. The items on its negative list, which specifies fields that are off-limits to foreign investors, have been further slashed to 29 in the national version and 27 for pilot free trade zones (FTZs). China has also released a guideline for improving its FTZs and approved a plan that aims to expand comprehensive pilot programs to accelerate the services industry's opening-up. These efforts reflect China's steady drive to expand institutional opening up, such as that of rules, regulations, management, and standards, and its commitment to deepening and broadening opening up. As Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, noted, China has a spirit of openness where businesses worldwide can connect, forge partnerships and contribute to a more prosperous and interconnected global economy. China's pursuit of high-level opening up has expanded the space for mutually beneficial China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation. In 2023, the U.S. set up 1,920 new enterprises in China, with an actual investment of $3.36 billion, up 52 percent from the previous year. At the same time, China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has generated substantial business opportunities and profits for American companies. For example, Tesla's electric vehicle sales in the Chinese mainland have hit a record high of 657,000 units in 2024, up 8.8 percent year on year. China's voluntary opening policies have benefited financial institutions from all countries including the United States. More than 10 American insurance companies have subsidiaries in China. American financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, American Express, Bank of America, and MetLife, have achieved substantial investment returns as strategic investors in Chinese financial institutions. Meanwhile, BlackRock, Fidelity, Neuberger Berman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Alliance Bernstein have been allowed to establish wholly foreign-owned fund management companies in China. Some U.S. politicians have called for greater opening up of China to American business for the good of both China and the United States. The fact, however, is that China has repeatedly affirmed its welcome to companies from all countries, including the U.S., to invest and thrive in China. China has developed sound regulations, policies and procedures for foreign investment, promoted trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and made active efforts to foster a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. It has been and will remain an ideal, safe, and promising destination for foreign investors. It is hoped that the U.S. will refrain from creating obstacles for American companies seeking to invest in China, and stop using national security and America First as catch-all pretexts for demanding openness from others while tightening its own trade restrictions. Such protectionist moves risk disrupting global industrial and supply chains and weakening the multilateral trading system. Only through mutually beneficial cooperation can China and the U.S. realize their respective development goals. This not only serves the common interests of both countries but also meets the expectations of the international community.

Title: Baxter & Bailey bring The Design Laundry to Barcelona

With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. Baxter & Bailey could've taken the safe route for their Friday evening talk at OFFF. They could've showcased slick work for the Royal Parks, the Royal Mail, or the London Soundtrack Festival. Instead, they pulled back the curtain on what really goes on behind the pristine curtain of the design industry, revealing a tangle of mistakes, mishaps and moments of pure chaos. "We live in a world where everything we see is finished, polished and presented, which can be quite a daunting prospect for young designers entering the industry," they explained. "It's a nice reminder that even the most experienced designers mess up sometimes." With that, Matt and Dom launched into an hour of confession, comedy, and collective therapy. It was an airing of creative dirty laundry, shared in the spirit of learning and laughter. Baxter & Bailey started with their own biggest fumbles, warming the crowd up for what was to come. Dom kicked things off with a tale from a night train journey in Russia en route to a crucial pitch for a telecoms giant. Sharing a cabin with a snoring stranger called Constantin from Moscow, he awoke to find his roommate enjoying breakfast in nothing but his pants. In the panic to flee, Dom left his carefully crafted presentation boards on the train. "What I learnt from that mistake was: even if you wake up and the first thing you see is an old Russian man's crotch, keep cool, don't panic and remember what you're doing," Dom told the crowd. Matt followed with a story from a concept presentation a decade ago. Just a few minutes in, the client's top boss entered the boardroom, watched in silence… then stood up, gave a thumbs down, and stuck out his tongue with a rude noise of disapproval. "I still cringe every time I hear that story," said Dom. The pair soon revealed they weren't alone in their confessions. Before the talk, they'd floated the idea to British design legend Rian Hughes, who not only approved but offered his own disaster story. On screen, Rian recalled his first job interview at a Camden agency. Lost, rain-soaked, and 45 minutes late, he finally arrived with his portfolio strapped to a trolley. As he lifted it onto the table, he noticed something brown on his sleeve and realised he'd rolled the trolley through dog poo. One side of his portfolio was covered, and so was the director's mahogany table (not to mention the stench). "Despite this auspicious beginning, I got the job," said Rian. "But I don't recommend it as an interview technique – and the job was shit anyway. I lasted three months." With proof of concept secured, Baxter & Bailey launched The Design Laundry, a growing archive of creative calamities submitted by designers across the industry. The idea is that people share their worst moments, get them out in the open, and maybe learn something in the process. Here are just a few they aired at OFFF. Jamie Ellul, founder of Supple Studio, joined in from the remote countryside to share his cautionary tale. Early in his solo career, he landed a job designing a brochure for an accountancy firm. "I think it might have actually looked worse than it did in the beginning when I was finished," Jamie admitted. He sent the final artwork to print, then forwarded the printer's quote to the client before hopping on a train. Following weeks of radio silence, the client finally replied: 'Hi Jamie, I've been wondering how to respond to your email, having seen your note to the printer below on the email chain'. That note read: 'Please don't judge me—this is the shittest thing I've ever designed'. Cue laughter from the crowd – and a lesson in double-checking email chains. As Matt and Dom pointed out, email fails were the most common type of submission. We've all been there. Next up: Francis Jackson, formerly of MetaDesign and OPX and now a psychotherapist, shared her story in a letter. Years ago, she worked with The King's Trust on a beautifully designed book promoting the value of art in the built environment, Art in the Public Environment. The problem was that a glaring typo was revealed by none other than the King of England himself after hundreds of printed copies went out across the country. What the front cover actually said was: 'Art in the Pubic Realm'. When the King was handed a copy while visiting the offices, he swiftly returned it, eyebrows raised. I'm sure Francis was hoping for the ground to open up beneath her at that moment! Daljit Singh, co-founder of pioneering digital agency Digit, appeared onscreen in sunglasses, mid-holiday, to recount a transatlantic disaster. After landing in the UK from New York in 2007, Daljit got a message: Gene Simmons (yes, from KISS) wanted to meet him. Being a huge fan, he turned around, caught the next flight back, and headed straight to the hotel. But as he flew, doubt crept in, and he asked himself: could it be a prank? He'd played an elaborate hoax on his friend Simon not too long ago, so when told to ask for "Simon Smith" at reception (apparently Gene's alias), his suspicions grew. Still, he went upstairs, knocked on the door, and shouted, "Simon, come out, you massive tosser." None other than Gene Simmons opened the door. "You English guys have got such strange senses of humour," he said, before ushering Daljit in. The meeting lasted three awkward minutes. They didn't get the job. After airing these disasters, Matt and Dom returned to each story to highlight the learning points. Jamie reminded us to treat every job (and every email) with care. Francis' typo showed that even major mistakes fade with time. Daljit's story offered a reminder not to let doubt derail bold decisions. The laundry pile grew with more stories, laughs, and stains, and the pair could've gone all night. Luckily, this won't be the last spin cycle for The Design Laundry. Dom and Matt are bringing the idea to future events and inviting more submissions through their website. Because if creativity is a messy process, there's no shame in airing a little dirty laundry.

Title: Texas Stock Exchange CEO Sees State Muscling In on NYC, Delaware

The head of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange said the state is making a serious play to reshape the US financial landscape, using new pro-business laws and a proposed ban on trading taxes to take on longtime power centers on the East Coast. Governor Greg Abbott signed legislation this week aimed at strengthening legal protections for companies and curbing shareholder challenges, part of a broader strategy to lure corporate registrations from Delaware. Meanwhile, a ballot measure in November would ban taxes on securities transactions just as a group of New York lawmakers is pushing to bring back a state levy on stock sales. “Texas is going in direct competition with Delaware and New York, Delaware for registrations and New York for listings and the exchange operators,” Jim Lee, founder of the Texas Stock Exchange, said in an interview a day after attending a signing ceremony with Abbott. The new measures show “the commitment that the state is making to building out capital markets here.” Lee’s Dallas-based bourse project is backed by the likes of BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and pipeline billionaire Kelcy Warren. But for all the progress Lee has made, he still has a long way to go to get the Texas Stock Exchange up and running. The exchange is still under review by US securities regulators. Lee said approval will potentially come by the end of the third quarter, keeping the schedule on track to begin trading early next year. The exchange will soon have about 60 employees working from a temporary office in Dallas. It’s still shopping for a permanent space, which it plans to announce in the summer. The industry’s powerful incumbents appear to be taking notice. The New York Stock Exchange announced it would reincorporate its Chicago operations in Dallas to start an equities exchange in Texas. Nasdaq Inc. unveiled a plan to open a regional headquarters in Dallas. Together, the two exchanges dominate US listings. “It’s flattering and we welcome them,” said Lee, chief executive officer of TXSE Group Inc., the parent company of the Texas exchange. “We’ve been driving this process for years now and we welcome them to the effort. They are formidable competitors.” The TXSE is trying to break through at a time when growing US businesses have been staying private for longer, tapping funding sources such as private equity firms that offer capital without the costs of operating a public company. Calling such expenses “a flaw in our public markets,” Lee is pledging to offer predictability to listing companies while holding down costs. He has national and global ambitions but says the initial focus will be on companies in the “southeastern quadrant” of the US from Texas to Florida and the Carolinas. Its primary trading platform will be in Secaucus, New Jersey. “The solution is, you have to have a lot more alignment and predictability for public companies, and we have to drive down cost,” he said. While the New York proposal to reinstate a tax on stock sales has little chance of becoming law for now, Lee said any future steps in that direction would benefit his state. Texas is also trying to entice companies to move their incorporation to the state as more executives question Delaware’s status as the gold standard for business litigation. Texas is developing a system of business courts. Elon Musk won shareholder approval last year to move Tesla Inc.’s incorporation to Texas after a Delaware judge voided his record-setting pay package. His Space Exploration Technologies Corp. also moved its incorporation to Texas from Delaware last year. Topics Texas

Humanoid and robotics developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Foxlink, Galbot, Mentee Robotics, NEURA Robotics, General Robotics, Skild AI and XPENG Robotics are adopting NVIDIA Isaac™ platform technologies to advance humanoid robot development and deployment. “Physical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “From AI brains for robots to simulated worlds to practice in or AI supercomputers for training foundation models, NVIDIA provides building blocks for every stage of the robotics development journey.” New Isaac GR00T Data Generation Blueprint Closes the Data Gap Showcased in Huang’s COMPUTEX keynote address, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams is a blueprint that helps generate vast amounts of synthetic motion data — aka neural trajectories — that physical AI developers can use to teach robots new behaviors, including how to adapt to changing environments. Developers can first post-train Cosmos Predict world foundation models (WFMs) for their robot. Then, using a single image as the input, GR00T-Dreams generates videos of the robot performing new tasks in new environments. The blueprint then extracts action tokens — compressed, digestible pieces of data — that are used to teach robots how to perform these new tasks. The GR00T-Dreams blueprint complements the Isaac GR00T-Mimic blueprint, which was released at the NVIDIA GTC conference in March. While GR00T-Mimic uses the NVIDIA Omniverse™ and NVIDIA Cosmos™ platforms to augment existing data, GR00T-Dreams uses Cosmos to generate entirely new data. New Isaac GR00T Models Advance Humanoid Robot Development NVIDIA Research used the GR00T-Dreams blueprint to generate synthetic training data to develop GR00T N1.5 — an update to GR00T N1 — in just 36 hours, compared with what would have taken nearly three months of manual human data collection. GR00T N1.5 can better adapt to new environments and workspace configurations, as well as recognize objects through user instructions. This update significantly improves the model’s success rate for common material handling and manufacturing tasks like sorting or putting away objects. Early adopters of GR00T N models include AeiRobot, Foxlink, Lightwheel and NEURA Robotics. AeiRobot employs the models to enable ALICE4 to understand natural language instructions and execute complex pick-and-place workflows in industrial settings. Foxlink Group is using them to improve industrial robot manipulator flexibility and efficiency, while Lightwheel is harnessing them to validate synthetic data for faster humanoid robot deployment in factories. NEURA Robotics is evaluating the models to accelerate its development of household automation systems. New Robot Simulation and Data Generation Frameworks Accelerate Training Pipelines Developing highly skilled humanoid robots requires a massive amount of diverse data, which is costly to capture and process. Robots need to be tested in the physical world, which can present costs and risk. To help close the data and testing gap, NVIDIA unveiled the following simulation technologies: Foxconn and Foxlink are using the GR00T-Mimic blueprint for synthetic motion manipulation generation to accelerate their robotics training pipelines. Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Mentee Robotics, NEURA Robotics and XPENG Robotics are simulating and training their humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab. Skild AI is using the simulation frameworks to develop general robot intelligence, and General Robotics is integrating them into its robot intelligence platform. Universal Blackwell Systems for Robot Developers Global systems manufacturers are building NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 workstations and servers, offering a single architecture to easily run every robot development workload across training, synthetic data generation, robot learning and simulation. Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro announced NVIDIA RTX PRO-powered servers, and Dell Technologies, HPI and Lenovo announced NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell-powered workstations. When more compute is required to run large-scale training or data generation workloads, developers can tap into NVIDIA Blackwell systems like GB200 NVL72 — available with NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud on leading cloud providers and NVIDIA Cloud Partners — to achieve up to 18x greater performance for data processing. Developers can deploy their robot foundation models to the NVIDIA Jetson Thor platform, coming soon — enabling accelerated on-robot inference and runtime performance.

After securing a strong base of support in the 2024 election, Donald Trump is positioning himself for a renewed push in foreign policy — an area that his supporters argue has deteriorated under recent Democrat direction. With growing global instability and concerns about America’s waning influence abroad, many see Trump’s return as an opportunity to reassert U.S. strength on the world stage. Citing what they view as failures in diplomacy, deterrence, and global leadership under the Biden administration, Trump’s supporters anticipate a more forceful, deal-driven approach that prioritizes national interest and restores America’s negotiating power. The Deal with Ukraine One of the most significant early foreign policy moves of President Donald Trump's second term is the U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed on April 30, 2025. The agreement, seen as a strategic counter to Russian influence, was finalized after months of complex negotiations and is viewed by Trump’s supporters as a testament to his assertive and transactional approach to foreign policy, especially in contrast to the strategies of the previous Democrat administration. Almost immediately, Democrat lawmakers and affiliated media outlets began to raise red flags. They argue that the agreement reflects an overly transactional and politicized approach to foreign policy, questioning whether Trump bypassed traditional diplomatic protocols to bolster his political standing. Democrats expressed concerns over the agreement’s terms, with some advising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reject the deal, citing fears of compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty and the absence of explicit security guarantees. Notably, Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) met with Zelenskyy shortly before his Oval Office meeting with Trump, urging caution against a “fake peace agreement” lacking security arrangements for Ukraine. Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) likened Trump’s approach to a coercive real estate tactic, suggesting the deal resembled a demand for Ukraine to “pay rent” through mineral concessions. Furthermore, Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) characterized the agreement as “extortion” in a televised interview. Undercutting Democrats’ Political Narrative Many Democrats view major deals initiated by Donald Trump as potentially damaging to their own standing because these deals shift the narrative in Trump’s favor. When Trump achieves visible wins on the international stage, it challenges Democrat criticisms of his leadership and complicates their messaging. Such developments can resonate with voters who prioritize results over rhetoric, thereby posing a threat to Democrat poll numbers and weakening their leverage in debates over foreign policy direction and executive decision-making. The Democrat party has built a complex network of influence across key financial and institutional channels. Supporters see this as a strategic framework for implementing progressive policy goals and ensuring long-term institutional stability. Initiatives like Trump’s foreign economic deals — particularly those negotiated outside traditional diplomatic or bureaucratic structures — are viewed by some Democrats as threats to a financial and governance model they have helped shape over decades. A growing concern among Trump-aligned policymakers is that meaningful progress in reshaping U.S.-Ukraine relations may be stalled as long as key Ukrainian institutions remain heavily staffed or influenced by figures aligned with pro-Democrat frameworks. Any effort by Trump to establish a new kind of dialogue with Ukraine may be constrained until there is a shift in Ukraine’s internal political and administrative landscape — one that allows for greater openness to his administration’s more transactional and sovereignty-focused foreign policy approach. And a notable example is Tomáš Fiala, a key figure in Ukraine’s financial sector with deep ties to Western institutions and a consistent advocate of liberal democratic alignment. Ties with Soros and the Democrat Party Fiala is the CEO and founder of Dragon Capital, a leading Ukrainian investment firm. He has served as the elected President of the European Business Association (EBA) from 2010 to 2015 and again from 2016 to 2021, leading Ukraine’s top business organization comprising over 1,000 companies with more than a million employees. He was also elected to the Board of Transparency International Ukraine from 2016 to 2020, part of a leading global anti-corruption watchdog. In October 2020, Fiala was elected to the Board of Directors of the Kyiv School of Economics. He has been associated with George Soros through business partnerships and media ownership in Ukraine. In 2015, Soros became an anchor investor in a new Ukraine fund managed by Dragon Capital, marking a significant international investment in the country following its 2014 revolution. Additionally, Dragon Capital’s pro-Western stance and Soros’s involvement have been noted in discussions about media ownership and potential foreign influence channels in Ukraine. By the way, Soros Fund Management has held various investment positions across the financial sector, including bonds issued by major firms like BlackRock. Regarding connections to the Democrat party, the media outlets associated with Fiala have supported Democrat figures. For instance, reports indicate that a media group funded by the Open Society Foundation and managed by Fiala played an active role in the U.S. electoral process, supporting Democrat candidates. As Trump Sets the Narrative, Democrats Struggle to Respond Some Democrat strategists are reportedly growing concerned that the ideological momentum behind Trump-aligned populism could disrupt their longstanding influence over policy and financial frameworks - both domestically and in foreign relations. This includes not only narrative control but also influence over financial channels such as foreign aid, NGO funding, and institutional partnerships. With the 2026 Congressional elections approaching, many within the Democrat party see the stakes as increasingly high. For them, preventing a deeper shift in public sentiment — and preserving their grip on key institutions and funding networks — has become a political priority. But Democrat strategies to counter his influence have largely fallen flat. Rather than offering a compelling alternative vision, many within the party appear to be relying on the hope that Trump will eventually sabotage himself through legal missteps or controversial decisions. Despite internal calls for a bold rebranding, Democrats remain fragmented and overly reactive, often focused more on opposing Trump than defining their own agenda. This passive stance leaves them vulnerable, especially as Trump continues to dominate political discourse with a clear, sovereignty-focused message. Ultimately, waiting for him to stumble may prove to be a losing strategy as the 2026 congressional elections approach. Ensuring Loyalty and Effectiveness As Donald Trump pushes forward with a series of high-profile foreign policy initiatives — ranging from negotiations with Ukraine on resource development to renewed diplomatic overtures in the Middle East — the Democrats are increasingly focused on delaying or obstructing these efforts. In this view, the Democrat strategy is less about offering a clear foreign policy alternative and more about buying time to regroup and rebuild public support after electoral losses. To effectively carry out the policy agenda, the president must continue to go beyond reforming agencies like USAID and pursue broader leadership changes across the federal government because as it stands, certain agencies are remaining staffed with individuals whose ideological leanings conflict with Trump’s vision. If Trump leaves pro-Democrat officials in key government and diplomatic positions, the Republicans risk enabling internal opposition that could undermine their foreign policy goals. These individuals, aligned with previous administrations’ multilateral and progressive agendas, may reinterpret or redirect the implementation of Trump-initiated deals to align with Democrat priorities.

The Deal with Ukraine One of the most significant early foreign policy moves of President Donald Trump's second term is the U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed on April 30, 2025. The agreement, seen as a strategic counter to Russian influence, was finalized after months of complex negotiations and is viewed by Trump’s supporters as a testament to his assertive and transactional approach to foreign policy, especially in contrast to the strategies of the previous Democrat administration. Almost immediately, Democrat lawmakers and affiliated media outlets began to raise red flags. They argue that the agreement reflects an overly transactional and politicized approach to foreign policy, questioning whether Trump bypassed traditional diplomatic protocols to bolster his political standing. Democrats expressed concerns over the agreement’s terms, with some advising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reject the deal, citing fears of compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty and the absence of explicit security guarantees. Notably, Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) met with Zelenskyy shortly before his Oval Office meeting with Trump, urging caution against a “fake peace agreement” lacking security arrangements for Ukraine. Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) likened Trump’s approach to a coercive real estate tactic, suggesting the deal resembled a demand for Ukraine to “pay rent” through mineral concessions. Furthermore, Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) characterized the agreement as “extortion” in a televised interview. Undercutting Democrats’ Political Narrative Many Democrats view major deals initiated by Donald Trump as potentially damaging to their own standing because these deals shift the narrative in Trump’s favor. When Trump achieves visible wins on the international stage, it challenges Democrat criticisms of his leadership and complicates their messaging. Such developments can resonate with voters who prioritize results over rhetoric, thereby posing a threat to Democrat poll numbers and weakening their leverage in debates over foreign policy direction and executive decision-making. The Democrat party has built a complex network of influence across key financial and institutional channels. Supporters see this as a strategic framework for implementing progressive policy goals and ensuring long-term institutional stability. Initiatives like Trump’s foreign economic deals — particularly those negotiated outside traditional diplomatic or bureaucratic structures — are viewed by some Democrats as threats to a financial and governance model they have helped shape over decades. A growing concern among Trump-aligned policymakers is that meaningful progress in reshaping U.S.-Ukraine relations may be stalled as long as key Ukrainian institutions remain heavily staffed or influenced by figures aligned with pro-Democrat frameworks. Any effort by Trump to establish a new kind of dialogue with Ukraine may be constrained until there is a shift in Ukraine’s internal political and administrative landscape — one that allows for greater openness to his administration’s more transactional and sovereignty-focused foreign policy approach. And a notable example is Tomáš Fiala, a key figure in Ukraine’s financial sector with deep ties to Western institutions and a consistent advocate of liberal democratic alignment. Ties with Soros and the Democrat Party Fiala is the CEO and founder of Dragon Capital, a leading Ukrainian investment firm. He has served as the elected President of the European Business Association (EBA) from 2010 to 2015 and again from 2016 to 2021, leading Ukraine’s top business organization comprising over 1,000 companies with more than a million employees. He was also elected to the Board of Transparency International Ukraine from 2016 to 2020, part of a leading global anti-corruption watchdog. In October 2020, Fiala was elected to the Board of Directors of the Kyiv School of Economics. He has been associated with George Soros through business partnerships and media ownership in Ukraine. In 2015, Soros became an anchor investor in a new Ukraine fund managed by Dragon Capital, marking a significant international investment in the country following its 2014 revolution. Additionally, Dragon Capital’s pro-Western stance and Soros’s involvement have been noted in discussions about media ownership and potential foreign influence channels in Ukraine. By the way, Soros Fund Management has held various investment positions across the financial sector, including bonds issued by major firms like BlackRock. Regarding connections to the Democrat party, the media outlets associated with Fiala have supported Democrat figures. For instance, reports indicate that a media group funded by the Open Society Foundation and managed by Fiala played an active role in the U.S. electoral process, supporting Democrat candidates. As Trump Sets the Narrative, Democrats Struggle to Respond Some Democrat strategists are reportedly growing concerned that the ideological momentum behind Trump-aligned populism could disrupt their longstanding influence over policy and financial frameworks - both domestically and in foreign relations. This includes not only narrative control but also influence over financial channels such as foreign aid, NGO funding, and institutional partnerships. With the 2026 Congressional elections approaching, many within the Democrat party see the stakes as increasingly high. For them, preventing a deeper shift in public sentiment — and preserving their grip on key institutions and funding networks — has become a political priority. But Democrat strategies to counter his influence have largely fallen flat. Rather than offering a compelling alternative vision, many within the party appear to be relying on the hope that Trump will eventually sabotage himself through legal missteps or controversial decisions. Despite internal calls for a bold rebranding, Democrats remain fragmented and overly reactive, often focused more on opposing Trump than defining their own agenda. This passive stance leaves them vulnerable, especially as Trump continues to dominate political discourse with a clear, sovereignty-focused message. Ultimately, waiting for him to stumble may prove to be a losing strategy as the 2026 congressional elections approach. Ensuring Loyalty and Effectiveness As Donald Trump pushes forward with a series of high-profile foreign policy initiatives — ranging from negotiations with Ukraine on resource development to renewed diplomatic overtures in the Middle East — the Democrats are increasingly focused on delaying or obstructing these efforts. In this view, the Democrat strategy is less about offering a clear foreign policy alternative and more about buying time to regroup and rebuild public support after electoral losses. To effectively carry out the policy agenda, the president must continue to go beyond reforming agencies like USAID and pursue broader leadership changes across the federal government because as it stands, certain agencies are remaining staffed with individuals whose ideological leanings conflict with Trump’s vision. If Trump leaves pro-Democrat officials in key government and diplomatic positions, the Republicans risk enabling internal opposition that could undermine their foreign policy goals. These individuals, aligned with previous administrations’ multilateral and progressive agendas, may reinterpret or redirect the implementation of Trump-initiated deals to align with Democrat priorities.

The company is working with the governments in Australia and the United States to build two quantum computers in the coming years - one in Brisbane and the other in Chicago.

Title: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’ Review: Benicio Del Toro Hilariously Dominates Wes Anderson’s Latest All-Star Wes Anderson Movie – Cannes Film Festival
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/05/the-phoenician-scheme-review-wes-anderson-benicio-del-toro-cannes-1236401800/
Time Published: 2025-05-18T17:45:00Z
Full Content:
By Pete Hammond Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic Like Jacques Tati, Woody Allen and Luis Buñuel, there can be no mistaking a movie directed and written by Wes Anderson. An auteur in the truest sense of the word, he is as much a painter with words and visuals that put us unquestionably into part of a brain that sees the world the way he wants to see it. There’s his Oscar-winning masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel; animated gems Isle of Dogs and my favorite Wes movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox; and a string of beloved film comedies including The Royal Tannenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom and so many more including his 2024 Oscar-winning short The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. It is good to report that the filmmaker is back in style with his latest, The Phoenician Scheme, after stumbling a bit through the overly narrated and artificial (even for Anderson) Asteroid City, the most recent of his films to debut in Cannes, just as his latest world builder, The Phoenician Scheme, did Sunday night in Competition. This one is particularly refreshing in that, instead of focusing on a number of characters, here it is Benicio Del Toro‘s Zsa-Zsa Korda, a shady, uber-wealthy industrialist who dominates the proceedings much the way we saw in other Anderson riffs like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Sure, there are the usual starry cameos running through the story, but it is all in the service of Zsa-zsa, a man who dominated the business world and global economy in Europe in the early 1950s in much the same way we see Elon Musk now, an equally shady rich guy whose track record is spotty at best. In fact, there also are sly comparisons we could make even to Donald Trump with this man, whose enemies are doing everything to bring down his empire where he is accused of swindling banks, skipping tariffs, filing frivolous lawsuits — you name it, he’s done it. But is it all bad? Watch on Deadline RELATED: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’s Benicio Del Toro, Michael Cera & Mia Threapleton On Wes Anderson’s Comedic Timing – Cannes Studio Zsa-zsa, who has survived six airplane crashes including the latest one that opens the film on a note of excitement, is even starting to see God, or at least a group of religious leaders who act as therapists in a way in fantasy sequences where he thinks he has died. Somehow he never does, even with a price on his head by any number of would-be assassins. His latest plan, with the lofty name of the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme, has him enlisting his 20-year-old daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton), who is in training to become a nun but whom he thinks could be better suited to ultimately take over his company and complicated financial dealings. Why not his nine — count ’em — nine sons (another Musk comparison)? He wants to give Liesl a shot. The idea is to create an infrastructure scheme for an unused area of Earth that can be mined for a potentially rich region that doesn’t exist yet. In return, his business takes in 5% of the newfound riches in perpetuity. To do this he also has to enlist a number of wealthy donors from the worlds of shipping, mining, railroad, banking, real estate and the black market. Their identities all are contained in a set of shoeboxes, each with a particular specialty. RELATED: Cannes Film Festival 2025: Read All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews First up is a visit to Prince Farouk (Riz Ahmed), who has proven savvy with his kingdom’s natural wealth, then to an underground tunnel for a meeting with railroad barons Leland (Tom Hanks) and Reagan (Bryan Cranston). Another box introduces us to Marseilles Bob (Mathieu Amalric), a gangster and nightclub owner who wants terrorists to stop shooting up his place. There alsois the shipping magnate (Jeffrey Wright) who could be crucial; a second cousin named Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, in briefly) who could be new wife material; and finally leading up to his brother, the conniving Uncle Nubar (a very amusing Benedict Cumberbatch), who is big trouble in the family. With Liesl just as interested in trying to solve her mother’s murder (could it be Nubar?) as in closing the gap of Zsa-zsa’s vast finances, they are on dueling paths, joined by the other major character to complete this triangle, that of Norwegian tutor Bjorn (Michael Cera), who also studies insects. Of course he does! As Anderson explains the mindset of Zsa-zsa, “he is a certain type of businessman who can always pivot. He has no obligation to the truth.” The director cites all sorts of real-life figures from the past as inspirations for this man, people only a Jeopardy! contestant might be able to reel off instantly, but you can certainly see the Trump/Musk influence creeping in, even though this was written long before their partnership got into the picture. At least that is what I sniff here, proving Anderson’s wholly fictional creation has some odd relation to our current reality. Can you imagine Zsa-zsa living in these times? RELATED: Full List Of Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery As with all Anderson films, the production values are spectacular. This one was shot almost exclusively on soundstages at Studio Babelsberg in Germany. Bruno Delbonnel’s lush cinematography (first time working on a feature with Anderson, who usually goes back to the same well of artisans) and Adam Stockhausen’s production design are exquisite as are Milena Canonero’s costumes and Alexandre Desplat’s score. The film belongs lock, stock and barrel to Del Toro, playing this Onassis-style billionaire who proves again to be so adept to the rhythms of Anderson’s dialogue and delivers flawlessly here. So do newcomer Threapleton as Liesl and Cera, a first-timer in Anderson’s stock company who undoubtedly will be asked back. Ahmed and Cumberbatch also are welcome additions, as is regular Richard Ayoade as a terrorist leader. Look for Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham as pop-ups along the way, with Hanks, Cranston, Johansson and others in for a fun day’s work. Anderson, Jeremy Dawson, John Peet and Steven Rales are producers.

They blew Cork away by 16 points this afternoon to leave their home support in a joyous mood in the May sunshine. Qualification from Munster has been assured and Limerick’s status as favourites to land a seventh provincial title on the bounce has hardened after the scale of victory they delivered here. Cork were left chastened after this beating and know they must now get a positive result at home to Waterford next Sunday to prolong their season. The cold truth was that this game was settled by the interval, Limerick retreating to the dressing room with the comfort of a commanding 2-18 to 0-9 advantage. Goals from Aaron Gillane and Adam English underlined their utter dominance in that period. After Tom Morrissey had snapped over a brace of points, Gillane set the tone in the third minute when he gathered the ball in the left corner and took advantage of a slip by Niall O’Leary. The Patrickswell man galloped in along the endline, sidestepped Ciarán Joyce, and drilled home his shot. Cork’s Alan Connolly and Diarmaid Byrnes of Limerick James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Cork did notch the next three points of the game to cut the deficit to two but they were chasing in Limerick’s slipstream for the remainder of the afternoon. By the time Limerick raised a green flag again in the 27th minute through English, released by the outstanding Cian Lynch for the strike, they were 2-12 to 0-6 clear. The signs were ominous for Cork and they could have shipped further goals but Barry Nash’s effort went wide under pressure from a swarm of Cork defenders, Shane O’Brien was hooked on another occasion, and in the same passage of play, Tom Morrissey’s effort was blocked on the line by Mark Coleman. The pressure on the Cork defence was intense. Limerick, driven on by the power of their half-back line where Kyle Hayes excelled, were in control and Cork couldn’t get their attacking game going to bag the boost of a goal at the other end. Nickie Quaid was equal to a Patrick Horgan strike in the 21st minute after Brian Hayes fashioned an opportunity, and Cork were left staring at a 15-point deficit at the break. Advertisement Cork’s Shane Barrett and Tom Morrissey of Limerick. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO The second half had a lower-key feel to it. Cork sprung Séamus Harnedy from the bench and he landed two points during his time on the pitch, while Horgan finished with 1-9 to his credit, but his overall display also featured some poor shooting as he chalked up four wides from frees and dropped another short. Cork landed seven of the first 10 points in the second half, substitute Cormac O’Brien impressing, but it was damage limitation stuff such was the majesty of hurling that Limerick had produced in that opening period. Cork’s goal arrived ten minutes from full time, Horgan smashing home a 20-yard free after Brian Hayes had been fouled. The outburst of celebration in the Cork support was soon quelled as Limerick grabbed their third goal, Gillane firing home a penalty after he was fouled by Eoin Downey. Substitutes Cathal O’Neill and Peter Casey kept the Limerick scoring tally ticking over, and the champions are now in the driving seat to return to another provincial decider. Scorers for Limerick: Aaron Gillane 2-7 (1-6 frees, 1-0 pen), Adam English 1-2, Tom Morrissey 0-5, Gearóid Hegarty 0-3, Peter Casey 0-2, Cathal O’Neill 0-2, Michael Casey 0-1, Diarmaid Byrnes 0-1, Cian Lynch 0-1, Shane O’Brien 0-1, David Reidy 0-1.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 05/18 update below. This post was originally published on May 17 Bitcoin has been thrust back into the spotlight by extreme price swings this year, with U.S. president Donald Trump’s assault on the global trade order resulting in wild predictions of total U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has reclaimed $100,000 per bitcoin, topping the closely-watched level even as BlackRock quietly issues a stark bitcoin warning. Now, as crypto traders brace for a perfect storm to hit the bitcoin price, JPMorgan analysts have flipped from gold to bitcoin, predicting the bitcoin price will outperform gold over the rest of 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon remains skeptical of bitcoin and crypto despite the bitcoin ... More price boom over the last few years. "Between mid-February and mid-April gold was rising at the expense of bitcoin, while of the past three weeks we have been observing the opposite, i.e. bitcoin rising at the expense of gold," JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note seen by Decrypt. "In all, we expect the year-to-date zero sum game between gold and bitcoin to extend to the remainder of the year, but are biased towards crypto-specific catalysts creating more upside for bitcoin over gold into the second half of the year." Those "crypto-specific catalysts" include the passage of pro-crypto laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as Trump’s support of the technology. Elsewhere, Wall Street and tech giants are quietly gearing up to blow up the crypto market. 05/18 update: A U.S. bill that would regulate stablecoin issuers, formerly introducing crypto into the established financial system, will be debated by Congress this coming week, with some claiming it’s poised to pass the Senate. The bitcoin price surged to $106,000 per bitcoin on Sunday, climbing to a level not seen since early February and putting it in touching distance of its all-time high of almost $110,000. “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins,” Republican senator Bill Hagerty from Tennessee, who sponsored the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act, said in a statement. After Democrats raised eleventh hour concerns over the bill earlier this month that stemmed from U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration’s links to the crypto world, the bill has been redrafted to satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements, according to a copy seen by Coindesk. “Let’s get this home, we are ready for adoption and to revolutionise the way this financial market works,” Bo Hines, executive director of the president’s council of advisors for digital assets, said during the Consensus crypto conference this week. “We’re actually having these conversations in real-time—I’m extremely confident in the fact that they will get it pushed through, we’d love to see it on the president’s desk. We’re well on our way to achieving the presidents’ goal. We are moving extremely quickly and effectively.” Crypto companies have long been calling for regulation, with Congress under president Joe Biden trying and failing to get rules for stablecoins and issuers passed into law. "The industry wants regulation," investor Ira Auerbach from Offchain Labs said in emailed comments. “The message from those I engage with is clear: Give us the rules of the game and watch innovation flourish.” In April, the JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin’s burgeoning reputation as “digital gold" was under pressure as the bitcoin price failed to hold up in the face extreme market volatility triggered by Trump’s global trade war. The bitcoin price plummeted to around $75,000 per bitcoin, dropping over 30% from its all-time high of almost $110,000, as traders panicked over Trump’s tariffs but has since bounced back to over $100,000. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... More predictions. Bitcoin price bulls have remained upbeat, however, with Miller Value Partners chief investment officer and chairman, Bill Miller IV, telling CNBC the bitcoin price will keep climbing until it eclipses gold’s $20 trillion market capitalization. “Bitcoin’s back in the six-figures with a lot of room to go. If you compare its primary functional use case, a check and a balance on the lack of accountability in fiat unit creation, we still have a long way to go,” Miller said, predicting bitcoin’s “functional superiority” will push it to a price of $1 million per bitcoin. The gold price has hit its own record high this year as investors flee to the traditional safe haven, though it has dipped in recent weeks as the global trade war looks increasingly close to being resolved. With bitcoin’s market capitalization “back above $2 trillion and gold trading north of $3,200/oz, the two now stand side-by-side—as hedges against geopolitical turmoil and, increasingly, as high-conviction stores of value for the future,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

Register | Sign in Latest News Current Drivers Current Teams Current Circuits Latest Galleries Gallery Categories NEWS STORY18/05/2025 Today's race - probably the last at this iconic track, unless, God (and the WEF, Bill Gates, Blackrock etc.) willing, there is another pandemic - can go one of several ways. It could be decided at the first corner, or certainly on the opening lap, and then become one long DRS train, or it could be a genuine thriller. The Weather Gods are not going to be playing a part, which leaves it down to tyres, pit stop strategy and good old grit and determination. We know from experience that neither Oscar nor Max is prepared to give an inch, so the opening lap will be vital, however with the likes of Russell, Norris, Alonso Sainz, Albon and Hadjar in close proximity there should be added drama from the outset. Then we have the frustrated Ferraris, not to mention an equally fired-up Antonelli. A one-stop is the most viable choice, in part because there is only one DRS zone and also because this is the longest pit lane of the season in terms of time lost during a pit stop. The combination of medium and hard, with a stop between laps 17 and 23, is the most likely. However, as an alternative, some drivers might prefer to go for a longer first stint, starting on the hard, in the hope of an eventual Safety Car, in which case the switch to medium would be between laps 37 and 43. A two-stop strategy is not out of the question in terms of total race time, but the factors just mentioned mean it is at a disadvantage. For anyone attempting this, the best combinations would be medium-hard-hard." Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen and Antonelli all have one set of fresh mediums available, while, of those mentioned, Norris has one set of fresh hards while the rest have two. As for the soft - the infamous C6s - we are not going to see them again today, indeed the drivers would be happy never to see them again such were the issues they had with them yesterday. Despite the drama of Q2 and Q3, Aston Martin insists that its qualifying positions are not purely down to tyre choice but also the raft of upgrades brought here. Hopefully, Alonso and Stroll can use their positions, and the limitations of the Imola track, to convert their grid spots into a decent points haul. The Spaniard is always 'up for it', consequently it has been disappointing to see his frustration this season. Yesterday proved he still has fire in his belly, and given the equipment can still do the business. The Williams pair have looked strong all weekend, and it is good to see Sainz finding his feet, and while the Grove outfit should be in for some decent points there is still a long, long way to go before we can start thinking podiums. Having looked so strong on Friday, Gasly fell away somewhat yesterday, but he should give a good account of himself today, though Hadjar and Stroll will be keen to thwart him. The drama of the front rows aside, the real drama this afternoon should come from behind what with the Ferraris, Hamilton, Colapinto and Tsunoda. Having harangued Jack Doohan since before the season even began, Colapinto's 'fans' have now turned their attention elsewhere, giving poor old Tsunoda grief after the Red Bull driver gesticulated after being impeded by the Alpine. The Argentine has spoken out at the abuse levelled at Tsunoda - much of it racist - but sadly that appears to be the sort of demographic the sport is attracting these days. Despite his excellent debut last year Colapinto was subsequently involved in far too many crashes - costing Williams a small fortune - however this appears to have been overlooked amidst the anticipation of taking Doohan's seat. Yesterday he picked up where he left off, consequently the doubts over his potential remain. Already condemned to the back of the grid, a complete new engine change means that poor old Yuki will start from the pitlane. Colap;into drops one place after he entered the fast lane in the pit lane before the re-start time was confirmed. Talking of qualifying, Haas is still arguing over the fact that Bearman's final Q1 lap was disallowed, though it is unlikely that the stewards will change their mind, and even if they do, what can be done about it? With only one stop looking likely, not to mention the sole DRS zone and the fact that overtaking is nigh impossible, other than tyre choice it is the pit stop strategy that could be a decider today, so it is going to be fascinating to watch for the undercuts and overcuts. In the minutes before the pitlane opens, there is drama in the Williams garage where a leak has been detected on Albon's car. It's unclear what sort of leak it is so the car is being stripped down. The pitlane opens and Verstappen is first out, followed by Hulkenberg, Hadjar, Sainz and Lawson. Air temperature is 24 degrees C, while the track temperature is 46 degrees. It is bright and sunny. That said, Race Control says there is a 20% chance of rain. While Albon's car is sorted and the Thai driver takes his place on the grid, there is activity at the rear of Russell's Mercedes. All are starting on mediums bar Hamilton, Antonelli, Hulkenberg, Bearman and Tsunoda. Fresh rubber for all bar Russell, Alonso and Stroll. They head off on the formation lap, all getting away cleanly. The grid forms. They're away! Piastri gets away well, as does Russell right behind, but Verstappen is slow off the line and as they take the kink that is Turn 1 the Red Bull and Mercedes are side-by-side. However, heading into Tamburello Verstappen starts to brake early and having left Russell for dead clearly catches Piastri on the hop and is through to take the lead. A brilliant move by the world champion. "Piastri, what is he doing," asks a frustrated Russell who is boxed in behind the McLaren as Verstappen forges ahead. At the end of Lap 1, it's: Verstappen, Piastri, Russell, Norris, Alonso, Sainz, Albon, Stroll, Gasly and Leclerc. Hamilton is down to thirteenth and Antonelli up to twelfth. Ocon pits for hard tyres. Hamilton and Antonelli are side-by-side as they battle for 12th, while Gasly goes off and into the gravel at Turn 10 as he battles Leclerc. The Frenchman drops to 14th. After 3 laps Verstappen is 1.4s clear of Piastri as Leclerc closes on Stroll. As Russell remains 2.4s down on Piastri a DRS train consisting of nine cars forms behind the Mercedes. Sainz is harrying countryman Alonso as Hamilton is all over Antonelli further back. At the start of Lap 9, Norris tries a Verstappen on Russell, but is unable to pull it off. "I'm not sure how I'm going to make it to the target lap, pushing like this," admits Russell. In his determination to pass the Mercedes, Norris has two wheels on the grass. "He just drove on the grass," says a surprised Russell. As the pair continue to battle, Alonso and Sainz close in. Finally, following a little mistake by Russell, Norris passes the Mercedes as they head into Variante Villeneuve. Russell and Sainz both pit at the end of Lap 11, rejoining in 15th (Russell) and 16th. A two-stopper? Leclerc also pits, rejoining in 15th. "Plan A is very ambitious at the moment," says Piastri. Check out our Sunday gallery from Imola here. {pb] Alonso and Bortoleto pit at the end of Lap 12, as Leclerc posts a new fastest lap (20.505). The undercut has seen Leclerc pass Russell and Alonso. Replay shows flames from the front-left wheel on Alonso's car as he headed down the pitlane following his stop. Piastri pits at the end of Lap 13. An issue with the front-right sees the Australian rejoin in 12th, 4.9s ahead of Leclerc. Stroll pits at the end of Lap 14, as Hamilton is up to 6th. It's a slow stop for Stroll who rejoins in 17th. After 15 laps, it's: Verstappen, Norris, Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Hulkenberg, Colapinto and Bearman, though all have yet to stop. The leading car yet to stop is Tsunoda, who is 0.599s ahead of Piastri. The Japanese driver is told to do his best to hold him up. He tried, but to no avail, Piastri is through and seeks to make up the 32s gap to Verstappen. Having made short work of Bearman Piastri sets off after Colapinto. Out front, Verstappen leads Norris by 9.6s. As Piastri passes Colapinto, Tsunoda is battling a charging Leclerc. "The key for us is clean air and going long," Norris is told. "Albon 21.8, 21.8," Sainz is told as Leclerc passes Tsunoda for 11th. "There is no gap right now," Hamilton is told, "we are not ruling out Plan C." "Understood," he replies. Despite earlier fears the medium appears to be coming back. "It's like the rear track-rod or something is broken, the rears are moving," complains Russell. Colapinto pits at the end of Lap 22 and rejoins in 20tgh, as Piastri passes Hulkenberg for seventh. As Hamilton continues to harry Antonelli, Piastri closes on the pair. On Lap 26, Piastri passes Hamilton in Tamburello, the Briton offering no resistance. The Australian subsequently repeats the move on Antonelli, as he sets off after Hadjar, who can do Verstappen some good if he can hold off the McLaren. Piastri passes the RB to claim fourth, leaving him 32s down on Verstappen. Norris pits at the end of Lap 28, rejoining in seventh ahead of Leclerc. The VSC is deployed as Ocon has stopped on track. Verstappen pits as do Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton and a whole load of others. "Unbelievable, unbelievable," complains Leclerc at the turn of events. While a one-stopped played to his advantage, this has wrecked his race. As the dust settles, Verstappen leads Norris, Albon, Piastri, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Alonso, Stroll and Leclerc. Russell is down to twelfth. The VSC is withdrawn and as Leclerc tries to catch Stroll napping, Verstappen leads Norris by 19.9s. Replay shows a possible unsafe release for Antonelli. Norris post a new fastest lap (19.816), as Piastri hunts down Albon. Unseen, Leclerc has passes both Aston Martins, while Sainz has passed Tsunoda for 13th. Hamilton finally passes Antonelli in Tamburello to claim 6th, as the stewards have noted Tsunoda for causing a potential collision with Sainz. Russell passes Stroll and immediately closes on the other Aston Martin as Hamilton posts a new fastest lap (19.473). The crowd roars as Hamilton sweeps by Hadjar to claim fifth, the VSC having played out perfectly for the seven-time world champion. Now 18.7s ahead of Norris, Verstappen is leaving the opposition for dead. In fifth, Hamilton is the leading driver on the faster medium tyres. "I had to use a lot of tyres to get through those two," says Hamilton when told he is up to P5. Meanwhile, teammate Leclerc passes Antonelli for 7th. Hulkenberg passes Alonso for tenth as Tsunoda passes the other Aston Martin for 13th. Leclerc passes Hadjar to claim 6th, leaving him 2s down on his teammate. However, this raises the question of whether on hards, while his teammate is on mediums, will team orders come into play again? Sainz passes Hulkenberg for tenth as Tsunoda passes Alonso for 12th. "I'm the unluckiest ******* driver in the world," sighs Alonso. "It's going to be torture," he adds, knowing that he is destined to slip further down the order. "Swap the positions," Colapinto is told. He duly obliges, allowing Gasly through to take 15th. "I've got an issue," says Antonelli as he pulls to the side of the track on Lap 46. The Safety Car is deployed. Verstappen pits, taking full advantage of the freebie, as Norris follows suit. "We need to stay out, we don't have a tyre to last until the end," Leclerc is told. Hamilton and Hadjar pit as Norris rejoins behind his McLaren teammate. Hamilton rejoins in 7th, as Alonso and Stroll pit, along with Colapinto and Bortoleto. Next time around Albon pits, the Thai driver rejoining in fifth. As Piastri closes to within 1.8s of Verstappen - on 18 lap old rubber - they are taking their time in removing Piastri's car. With Norris on fresher rubber, McLaren is going to have to make a tough decision over the course of the remaining laps. Behind the Safety Car it's: Verstappen, Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Albon, Russell, Hamilton, Sainz, Hadjar and Hulkenberg. "I see tyres are pretty dead," says Norris. "I'm not asking to be let by, I'm just saying." "These tyres are going to be incredibly difficult to restart," warns Leclerc. With 11 laps remaining, Bearman is told he can un-lap himself, which should take another lap or so. Piastri's tyres are 21 laps old, Leclerc and Russell's 22 laps. The Safety Car is withdrawn at the end of Lap 53. Verstappen lets loose, and as Piastri follows Leclerc tries to make a move on Norris. Having failed, the Ferrari driver comes under attack from Albon. Check out our Sunday gallery from Imola here.

Posted by kenji, 7 hours ago "@ED. I'm still here...smarting, hahaha. Imola results were partially expected give how pacy the Red Bull was. Oscar got done over by Verstappen and it was very much a catch me if you can exercise from there on. It peed me right off but that's racing. What were McLaren thinking pitting Piastri on lap 12. To my mind that was a disaster just waiting to be played out...as it certainly did. Must admit though that Oscar scything through the field was really great to watch.In the end Norris's plaintive pleading to be let by wasn't missed despite Norris claiming he was just making an observation!!! Fortunately the team were not about to risk it and he had to make a pass on merit, on newer rubber which was easier for the team to defend, The race exceeded expectations and Imola is a far nicer environment to hold a race. All I'm hoping for now is for Piastri to get a pole position in Monaco and do the business. That will make the run down to the first corner something to behold."

The Red Bull is every bit as fast (in clean air) as the McLaren: its performance in Qualifying attests this. As a side issue it seems that Max is still the only driver who can come to terms with his RBR car. If RBR want to win any Team gongs they need to address this problem. Even if Max were to win every race, McLaren, Mercedes or even Ferrari, who all have two drivers able to extract decent performance from their car, stand a chance of winning the Team Championship.

A portfolio manager, she spent more than a decade at BlackRock, where her duties included trading risk-off assets like government bonds. But, in 2021, Thornton’s career took a sharp turn—she left her post at the world’s largest asset manager and entered the world of Web3. "There's just a lot of opportunities here," Thornton said of the crypto industry. That's particularly true for women, she added, despite the fact that the space's ranks are overwhelmingly dominated by males. "It's exciting," Thornton said. "People [are] coming from other industries, bringing their knowledge, bringing their skills, and applying them in this new way on this new asset class." Now, she spends her days in the crypto trenches, trading tokens like Bitcoin and one-of-one monkey jpegs —two emerging asset classes that lie at the opposite end of the risk spectrum compared to the financial instruments she traded during her traditional finance days. “When I'm working from home, my kids will kind of walk by my desk, and then they'll stop in their tracks and ask, ‘Mom, what are you doing?’” Thornton told Decrypt. “I'm like, ‘Oh, well, these are the Pudgy Penguins, and these are the Lil Pudgys,’” she said, explaining that the people in her life often seem mystified by her work. Her mother, she added, “thinks I work for Bitcoin.” (She does not.) Thornton is a senior index fund portfolio manager at Bitwise, a crypto-focused asset manager founded in 2017 that offers its clients a variety of investment vehicles, from crypto index funds to ETFs and private funds. As part of her role at the company, Thornton is responsible for implementing investment strategies across a large swath of portfolios—much like she did in her TradFi days. But, she also contributes to managing such unconventional funds as the Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index Fund, which targets a decisively more crypto-native crowd. “Where I am, and like so much of what I do really, is at that intersection of the two spaces,” Thornton told Decrypt. Thornton is one of a growing number of traditional finance professionals who are flocking to the crypto industry as institutions increasingly embrace the asset class, and lawmakers clear a path toward reducing federal regulatory oversight of the industry, encouraging its growth in the U.S. Although current employment data on the crypto industry is scant, a report from digital assets-focused research firm K33 Research shows that 199,000 people held jobs in the industry as of 2023, with the majority of those employees working for exchanges and brokerages or crypto-focused financial firms. That tally is small compared to the more than 6 million people who were employed in the finance and insurance sectors that same year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But now, as a growing number of institutions, states, and public companies invests in the asset class, elevating the price of Bitcoin back near its all-time high above $108,000 set in January, some experts say the crypto industry is poised to attract even more talent from more traditional employment sectors. A recent report from the World Economic Forum shows that over 10% of global GDP could be stored on blockchain by the end of 2025—a marked increase in blockchain use that could spur cross-industry hiring into Web3, according to crypto-focused recruitment services firm RecruitBlock. As Web3 and traditional finance become increasingly enmeshed, it's people like Thornton who will continue to close the gap between those worlds. Thornton said the differences between the emerging tech and traditional finance worlds can, at times, be stark. Crypto markets, unlike regular markets, never close. And whereas TradFi systems “usually have maybe two decimal places on a share quantity,” cryptocurrencies can go out to eight or 12 decimal places. Those differences inform Thornton and her colleagues’ work to manage crypto-focused portfolios much in the same way they used to manage TradFi portfolios, with an aim to create balance, reduce slippage, and tighten market exposure. “When you trade an asset with a price as large as Bitcoin, it matters if you're trading 10.48 or 10.483527397—and you have to get that level of precision,” Thornton said. “They hired me at Bitwise to manage the funds with the same level of precision and rigor and professionalism that we did at BlackRock.” Asked if she feels the gap between the professionalism that guides interactions in the TradFi world and the somewhat cultish espirit de corps of the Crypto Twitter (aka X) trenches, Thornton said, “I'm more of a lurker, to tell you the truth.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

May 18, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, May 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Elevance Health class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ELV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: How Dell is riding the AI wave while serving its massive installed base

UPDATED 13:38 EDT / MAY 17 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Dell Technologies Inc.’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under-appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, founder Michael Dell (pictured) always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman who literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Dell Technologies World 2025 in Las Vegas, we examine the question of how will Dell capture the explosive artificial intelligence opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, storage arrays and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? We believe Dell’s ability to stay out in front hinges on three imperatives, including: 1) Doubling down on full-stack “AI factory” systems that collapse infrastructure silos and accelerate time-to-AI value; 2) Unlock the latent power of its massive global channel — treating 200,000-plus partners as an extension of the direct engine rather than a bolt-on; and 3) Modernizing the core — that is, redesigning servers, storage and networking for highly parallel, power-hungry workloads while relentlessly driving down cost per floating-point operation and attacking the energy footprint customers now scrutinize. Below we show a chart Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke unveiled at Dell’s 2023 Financial Analyst Meeting in October 2023. The image depicts a time-series line that surges through key milestones in tech. We see in the 1990s the direct-to-consumer PC model takes off, then accelerates again in the early internet era when e-commerce turbocharges that same motion. Around the early 2010s the curve flattens — then dips — illustrating Dell’s struggle to morph into an enterprise powerhouse, jettisoning its relationship with EMC and moving forward on its own with 30-plus acquisitions such as Compellent, EqualLogic, Boomi, Perot Systems and many more, including several software assets. This ultimately proved to be an expensive learning exercise. The line rebounds sharply post-2016 after the EMC deal, peaks with the VMware stake, and now turns upward again as Dell positions itself squarely in the AI wave. In our view the slide is more than a history lesson; it’s a roadmap. Dell’s strategic pivots — private-equity reset, EMC megamerger and VMware monetization — set the stage for the current AI cycle. The task now is to translate that hard-won enterprise footing into end-to-end AI factories, monetized via a revitalized channel and powered by infrastructure that balances performance with energy pragmatism and an enticing value proposition for enterprise customers, relative to hyperscalers. Dell’s equity story aligns with the market’s awakening to generative AI. The five-year stock chart shown below highlights January 2023 with the shares at around $40 — valued well under one times sales. Visually, the chart shows a long flat-to-slightly-down channel from 2020 through 2022, a sharp diagonal ascent beginning Q1 ’23, an acceleration post-Analyst Day, and a gentle step-down to the current level — essentially a classic hype-cycle “installed base” plateau. AI is only half the story, perhaps even less. Dell returns ~80 % of free cash flow to shareholders, Michael Dell included, through repurchases and dividends. That framework resonates with value-oriented funds that previously ignored the name. The flip side, of course, is that sizable buybacks imply management sees limited return on investment in incremental R&D or M&A. Whether that tradeoff is sustainable as AI factories scale will be a key watch-point in upcoming quarters. Dell’s strategy appears to be focus on keeping costs down, making structural changes internally, applying AI to improve efficiencies and driving EBITDA and cash flow through the roof. As we said, it’s not sexy, but it’s lucrative. The slide below from Dell’s financial reporting distills the company’s P&L into two main vectors comprising the bulk of its nearly $100 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2025. The business is split almost evenly between its two reporting segments. In our view, the elegance of this structure is strategic. By preserving the PC volume HP jettisoned after its split, Dell keeps purchase-order muscle that wrings pennies out of every component across the stack. That flywheel lowers unit costs for ISG. Moreover, it allows Dell to claim true “end-to-end” status while competitors assemble piecemeal. During the early phases of the pandemic, an unprecedented surge in remote-work and at-home learning catalyzed a sharp spike in PC demand. Unit shipments soared, propelling Dell’s top-line revenue to record levels. However, the mix leaned heavily toward lower-margin notebooks. Because these volumes carried thinner product margins and added supply chain costs, the very growth that buoyed revenue simultaneously compressed gross margin, underscoring how a skew toward less profitable products can dilute profitability even in boom times. Today, the center of gravity has shifted to AI-optimized servers within the Infrastructure Solutions Group. Enterprises and service providers racing to deploy large language model and inference workloads are prioritizing GPU-dense systems with far higher average selling prices and margins. This mix enrichment somewhat offsets Nvidia’s higher silicon vig in each configuration. Consequently, margin expansion is visible despite the absolute dollar outlay for GPUs, illustrating the leverage that premium configurations bring when demand is both urgent and price-insensitive. Storage mix further accentuates this benefit as Dell controls more of the IP. Looking ahead, we believe the next catalyst will come from a broad-based storage refresh cycle. All-flash arrays shipped in the 2018-2020 window are hitting warranty expiration just as new AI-centric storage architectures – featuring graphics processing unit-direct fabrics, parallel file systems, object stores and greater AI affinity, combined with ultra-low-latency networking embedded into servers — enter mainstream availability. As customers migrate to these higher-value, high-capacity systems, the shift promises a second-order margin tailwind. In our view, the combination of richer storage average selling prices and recurring software licensing tied to data-services will fortify gross margin even further, extending the profitability uplift that began with today’s AI-server boom. VMware hitting Dell’s P&L once addressed Dell’s software deficiency, but the Broadcom divestiture leaves a hardware-centric portfolio. Management chose liquidity and balance-sheet clarity over folding VMware in and inflating margin optics. The explicit bet Dell is making in our view is that its supply chain scale combined with AI factories will allow the company to compete on value against the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Amazon Web Services Inc. In our opinion, Dell’s ~$100 billion hardware flywheel is both its moat and its challenge. Though the company has unmatched procurement leverage on one hand, it faces constant pressure to innovate at wafer-thin PC margins while chasing higher-value enterprise workloads. As much as we would have loved to see a VMware “spin in,” the company appears comfortable with and well-suited to pursue its current model and navigate the challenge. Above we show a comparative table of five tech incumbents — Dell, HPE, IBM Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp. — arrayed left-to-right starting with Dell, then ascending by revenue multiple. The rows list trailing-12-month revenue, gross margin, operating margin, operating cash flow dollars, OCF as a percentage of revenue, approximate market cap as of yesterday, and the resulting revenue multiple. In our opinion, Dell’s capital-return story and AI server uptick have closed part of the valuation gap, but the table tells a clear story – i.e. hardware scale alone makes it difficult to crack the 1x sales valuation ceiling. To earn a software-style multiple, Dell must: 1) Embed higher-margin intellectual property deeper into its AI factory stack; 2) Find a software engine it can keep this time; or 3) Massively automate with AI, cutting internal costs and driving unprecedented productivity by applying agents to redesign processes. We believe the third option carries low risk and is well underway. This in and of itself should provide a mid-term valuation boost. It remains unclear whether Dell will tap either or both of the other two options to trade at a higher multiple relative to peers. The slide below pulls from Enterprise Technology Research’s quarterly TSIS survey and plots Net Score — the firm’s composite metric for spending velocity — across five Dell categories: Laptops, Cloud Computing (read: private-cloud spend), Storage, Servers and Desktops. Three data points appear for each line — April ’24, January ’25 and April ’25 — letting us track budget sentiment over the past year. How to read the graphic Key observations We believe the survey reinforces Dell’s mixed reality. That is to say, macro belt-tightening is tamping down momentum, yet the PC franchise still outperforms and the private-cloud narrative resonates with a smaller but meaningful subset of buyers. The net effect is muted, not collapsing, which sets the stage for an AI-driven refresh cycle to re-accelerate infrastructure spend when and if budgets loosen. The slide below takes the same ETR dataset but switches the y-axis from Net Score to Pervasion — the percentage of survey respondents that cite Dell as a current supplier in each category. A red box highlights the metric and the bars immediately show how deeply embedded Dell is across the enterprise landscape, with the exception of cloud. Visually, the bars for laptops and servers extend above the 50% line, storage and desktops cluster just below 40%, and cloud computing trails in the low teens. What the numbers tell us We believe these pervasion stats highlight Dell’s greatest strategic asset – that is, a vast, sticky installed base it can mine for AI-factory upgrades and cross-portfolio pull-through. The challenge — and opportunity — is converting that legacy footprint into next-gen infrastructure before subscription-heavy rivals poach the refresh cycles. The next slide below is a two-axis scatter plot drawn from the same ETR dataset: A dashed horizontal line at 40% highlights the “elevated-momentum” threshold; no hardware vendor breaches that bar in this cut, underscoring the budget drag we discussed earlier and the maturity of this market. Our research indicates that Dell’s commercial laptop line enjoys best-in-class velocity and the broadest footprint, a combination rarely achieved in mature categories. That leadership not only sustains the company’s supply-chain economy of scale but also gives Dell a privileged entry point to upsell edge AI workflows and back-end infrastructure as customers modernize their fleets. The data below is another ETR scatter plot — Shared Net Score on the vertical axis, Penetration (Overlap) on the horizontal — this time comparing server vendors. The dashed red line at 40% again marks the “high-momentum” threshold. The slide below shows the ETR storage scatter, again plotting Shared Net Score (spending momentum) on the vertical axis and Penetration (Overlap) on the horizontal. Remember, ETR lumps primary storage and data-protection arrays into one category, so the field mixes old-guard storage area network vendors with next-gen and legacy backup platforms. In our view, Dell’s strategy is clear: Leverage its unparalleled storage footprint to seed AI-ready infrastructure upgrades, continue to update the portfolio with AI optimized storage (parallel file systems, high performance, disaggregated systems); and then rely on tight partnerships and full-stack integration to reignite the momentum currently captured by more specialized rivals. Our research indicates AI is not merely an incremental workload; it is redefining the entire data-center stack. The graphic below is our April 2025 update to the long-range data-center infrastructure forecast covering facilities, power, cooling, servers, storage and networking. A key marker highlights total spend topping $1 trillion in the early 2030s. In our view, the takeaway is stark – that is, every dollar of traditional x86 spend that flatlines must be replaced, or exceeded, by GPU-dense architectures. Suppliers that master power, cooling and supply-chain economics for AI factories will ride this trillion-dollar wave; those clinging to CPU-only designs risk shrinking into the gray band that barely registers on the forecast by decade’s end. IBM’s Z will survive this transition and x86 will continue to have its place, but the days of dominance for general-purpose architectures are over. The chart below strips out non-AI workloads and isolates annual AI infrastructure outlays through 2035. Two stacked areas tell the story: Note: overall AI infrastructure surpassing the trillion-dollar mark early next decade. We believe Dell is engineering squarely for the AI crossover: In our opinion, hyperscalers will continue to set the early pace, but the battleground for the next decade is enterprise AI. Dell’s strategy — “modernize what you have while layering in what you need for AI” — positions the company to capture that second-wave demand when the forecast says on-prem AI spend overtakes legacy infrastructure. We expect Dell to emphasize heavy dose of AI PC messaging — hopefully some new adoption metrics, refreshed form factors and a deeper dive on the neural processing unit roadmap. Apple’s early M-series momentum has stoked plenty of chatter around on-device inference; Dell must now prove its AI-chip-plus-NPU strategy can deliver comparable battery life, latency and developer traction. Expect Dell to bombard attendees with server, storage, and “AI factory” SKUs — an options portfolio that illustrates its core value proposition: customer choice at global scale. We believe the headline themes will be: Dell’s cadence has become predictable: Announce a “Project” one spring, ship the SKU the next. Alpine, Frontier, Fort Knox, Fort Zero, Helix — each followed that pattern. Customers have learned they can scope budgets a year out, but history also shows some projects fade quietly. Caveat emptor: Watch which previous code names and which 2025 “projects” receive firm ship dates versus “tech preview” language. Dell services has taken on an expanded role in this AI era. Dell recognizes that many customers not only lack an on-prem AI stack but they lack the skills necessary to move fast. Dell Consulting acts as an important accelerant to help customers navigate data quality challenges and governance and privacy concerns; and build solutions that can fit into existing legacy infrastructure while at the same time helping firms lean into the AI opportunity. Expect services and consulting to be prominently on display at DTW 2025 from laptops to the top of the stack and into managed services. Our analysis flags four areas that could challenge Dell’s AI ambitions: In our view Dell’s differentiation will not come from boasting the fastest GPU node — everyone will hit spec-sheet parity within quarters. The real test is whether Dell can orchestrate an end-to-end AI factory that stitches racks, storage, fabrics, software and services into a turnkey outcome, then deliver it through a channel that already owns the loading-dock badge at most enterprises. If Dell executes, it can harvest the cash flows of its mature PC and server franchises while expanding wallet share with AI-ready systems for the next decade. The pivot hinges on the following key question: Can those AI factories leap from Tier-2 and Tier-3 service providers into mainstream enterprise halls before cloud vendors lock in the market? We’ll be on the ground with theCUBE all week to test that thesis—and will report back in Breaking Analysis as the story unfolds.

“Big Short” hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 collapse of the housing market, just initiated a major portfolio shakeup. New SEC filings from Burry’s Scion Asset Management show the firm has taken a substantial bearish stance against Nvidia (NVDA), opening a large position in put options against the chipmaker’s stock. Scion has also reversed its previously bullish outlook on Chinese equities. The fund acquired bearish put options on major Chinese companies, including Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU). And here’s the twist – Scion’s only remaining long position is in New York-based Estee Lauder (EL), a bet on the cosmetics giant’s potential recovery. This solitary bullish stance underscores Burry’s cautious approach on the market, with the makeup industry often believed to be resilient to recession. This is the second time in recent years that Burry has gutted Scion’s portfolio. In 2023, Burry drastically reduced Scion’s holdings, only to later admit he was wrong while placing new, targeted bets.

Title: Silicon Valley's era of open debate fades as companies clamp down on employee dissent

Through the looking glass: As the tech industry continues to tighten control over employee speech and activism, a culture once defined by open dialogue and political engagement gives way to one marked by silence and fear of reprisal. "It's different now; employers feel they can get away with stuff," said a former Google employee. In recent years, Silicon Valley has witnessed a sharp shift in how major technology companies respond to employee activism and internal dissent. Once known for a culture encouraging open debate and political engagement, the tech industry is now cracking down on workers who challenge company policies or voice concerns about controversial business practices. Last month, two employees who interrupted an event with founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella to protest Microsoft's involvement in the Israel-Gaza war were quickly fired. Five years ago, by contrast, Microsoft divested from an Israeli facial recognition startup suspected of surveilling Palestinian citizens, partly in response to internal pressure. Also read: Microsoft fires engineers over AI protest at 50th-anniversary event This incident is part of a larger trend in the industry. Across the tech sector, companies are increasingly rejecting worker petitions, terminating employees who organize protests, and deleting critical posts from internal forums. Internet platforms have also warned against leaking information to the media, and some workers have lost their jobs as a result. Other policies have been implemented to prevent employees from contacting regulators. Last year, some OpenAI employees filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that the company's restrictive agreements prevented staff from warning regulators about AI safety risks. At the same time, the tech labor market has undergone dramatic changes, as mass layoffs, once rare among tech giants, have become increasingly routine. Since 2023, more than half a million tech jobs have been cut, according to Layoffs.fyi. This month, Microsoft announced a 3 percent reduction in its global workforce, following similar moves by Meta and Intel. The crackdown on dissent has intensified during the presidency of Donald Trump. Executives at Google, Meta, and Amazon contributed millions to Trump's inauguration committee and have engaged with the White House in private meetings. Many companies have also introduced policies that align with the administration's agenda, such as eliminating diversity initiatives and reversing longstanding content moderation practices. These changes might once have sparked significant activism among Silicon Valley's traditionally liberal workforce. However, aggressive management tactics and a weak job market have dampened employees' willingness to speak out. "A decade ago, employees would discuss controversial political issues out in the open and on employee message boards and at all-hands meetings," said Nu Wexler, a communications consultant with experience at Google, Twitter, and Meta. Now, "the companies have either strongly discouraged that or banned it." These tactics are having their intended effect. After Google announced in February that it would no longer avoid using AI for weapons or surveillance, internal message boards remained largely silent, a stark contrast to seven years ago when thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to cancel a Pentagon contract for AI-powered drone analysis. Employees, though, have not gone completely silent. A group called No Azure for Apartheid was launched and is led by current and former Microsoft employees who are protesting the company's business dealings with the Israeli military and government. It is holding a protest this weekend. However, Microsoft has come down hard on employees participating in such protests during company time. Microsoft fired at least five employees who protested during a town hall with CEO Satya Nadella. The workers, wearing T-shirts that read "Does Our Code Kill Kids, Satya?" were part of No Azure for Apartheid. Google, too, fired more than 50 employees last year after protests against its cloud-computing deal with the Israeli government. CEO Sundar Pichai had previously warned employees not to use the company as a "personal platform" or to "fight over disruptive issues or debate politics."

Title: Solana’s Q1 was all gas – Can SOL’s price catch up in Q2?

Solana kicked off Q1 with aggressive on-chain momentum – but price action told a different story. Solana [SOL] kicked 2025 off like it had something to prove — and it did. Q1 was defined by relentless on-chain activity, driving sustained price strength for SOL. Transaction throughput surged, active address count climbed, and network engagement hit fresh highs. But what about price action? Did that operational velocity translate into meaningful market traction? Not quite. Despite the fundamentals, SOL closed Q1 down 34.7% from its $190 opening, mirroring broader market weakness as many peers chopped sideways. Now, as we head deeper into Q2, investors must ask: Can Solana deliver on both fronts — Robust fundamentals and a rebound in quarterly returns? Messari’s deep dive breaks down Solana’s Q1 blowout in key metrics. Chain GDP popped 20% QoQ to $1.2 billion, while stablecoin supply rocketed 145% to $12.5 billion – USDC alone up 148% to $9.7 billion. In fact, daily DEX volume hit $4.6 billion on average, spiking to a staggering $36 billion on the 18th of January — that’s more than 10% of Nasdaq’s daily trading. Source: Messari Big players like BlackRock and ApolloGlobal launched real-world assets (RWA). Plus, prediction markets like Polymarket added Solana support, showing the network is attracting serious capital and use cases. This hypergrowth over 90 days confirms Solana’s devs are methodically stacking bricks for the next big DeFi and Web3 wave, reinforcing AMBCrypto’s thesis that a spot Solana ETF could be closer than the market thinks. But let’s keep it real: Fundamentals are only half the battle. If SOL can’t turn this on-chain strength into price alpha and reward patient holders during the FUD grind, a pullback to the Q1 floor of $95 is on the table. And the early warning signs are flashing. Solana kicked off Q2 at $124.56 and has since ripped to $167.72 – a clean 34.4% leg up. Early dip buyers are comfortably in the green, with cost basis anchored near the $95 Q1 floor, now sitting 75% above spot. Unrealized gains are piling up, but with late longs crowding in, the setup’s looking ripe for exit liquidity. On the 14th of May, Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) spiked to a monthly high of 1.7 billion as SOL printed $176.65. Source: Glassnode For context, a spike in CDD suggests older, high-conviction holders are offloading into strength. Since that peak, SOL has shed nearly 6%, echoing past cycles where major CDD blowouts coincided with market tops. Therefore, for Q2 to stay bullish, Solana needs more than just usage metrics. Instead, it needs a sustained bid-side conviction and fresh capital inflows to convert its operational strength into actual quarterly returns. Otherwise, this rally risks turning into another round of distribution masked by high activity.

Title: Short Washington DC And Go Long Seattle: Three Stocks To Buy Now

ByRobert Daugherty ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Moody's lowered the sovereign credit rating of the US, joining S&P and Fitch in stripping America's AAA status. While this is historic and will attract media attention, it reveals what has long been the Federal government's poor governance and management. Spending more than it collects in taxes and lacking the courage to make difficult decisions and think long term. The current administration is admirably trying to right the financial ship. However, its on-again, off-again tariffs will never collect the intended revenue. Additionally, its proposed tax reductions come without corresponding serious spending cuts or addressing entitlement payments. While the Federal government operates under different constraints than states, a comparative fiscal analysis proves instructive. Washington State's prudent financial governance stands in stark contrast to Washington DC's struggle with fiscal discipline. The state maintains exemplary creditworthiness through constitutional balanced budget requirements and strategic reserve mechanisms that have earned it high ratings from credit agencies—precisely the credentials the federal government has now lost. Washington State's economic fundamentals further distinguish it: the state ranks among national leaders in both median household income and GDP per capita. As federal fiscal challenges mount under the weight of escalating debt, Washington State's diversified economy continues to thrive, powered by a formidable technology sector, robust job creation, and sustained investment in innovation that positions the region for continued long-term growth despite broader economic headwinds. Looking specifically at Washington state, one can imagine an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that would likely best the S&P 500 with names like Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Redfin (RDFN) and Weyerhaeuser (WY). For investors seeking above-average long-term equity returns, these value stocks are primed to deliver. There are three Seattle-based companies that are worth buying now: Nordstrom (ticker JWN), Starbucks (SBUX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK), all of which offer attractive long-term returns. Nordstrom represents one of Seattle's most iconic retail success stories. Founded in 1901, this luxury department store chain has built a reputation for exceptional customer service and premium merchandise. After facing headwinds in recent years from e-commerce competition and pandemic disruptions, Nordstrom is executing a compelling turnaround strategy focused on omnichannel integration and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division. The company's most recent quarterly earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, with stronger-than-anticipated same-store sales growth and improved margins. Nordstrom reports earnings on June 6th, so stay tuned to hear more about their turnaround plans. Despite the challenging retail environment created by the current administration's ADHD governance style which has whipsawed markets, Nordstrom remains on track to hit its 2025 guidance—no easy task in today's unpredictable economic landscape. The company's loyal, high-income customer base provides resilience during economic uncertainty. Nordstrom's digital investments are paying dividends with robust online growth, while its brick-and-mortar footprint remains strategically valuable in prime locations. The stock currently trades at attractive valuations compared to historical averages, suggesting significant upside potential as discretionary spending rebounds. Nordstrom's management team has demonstrated discipline in inventory management and cost controls while maintaining the premium shopping experience that differentiates the brand. Their focus on exclusive merchandise partnerships and personalized styling services creates competitive advantages that pure e-commerce players struggle to replicate. Seattle's global coffee empire is positioned for renewed growth after recent operational challenges. Starbucks' unmatched brand loyalty and extensive retail network of over 38,000 stores worldwide provide enormous competitive advantages. The company's strategic initiatives under new leadership are addressing operational inefficiencies while expanding digital capabilities and strengthening customer connections. Starbucks delivered a standout quarterly performance that surpassed analyst expectations across key metrics, including comparable store sales and operating margins. The company has projected $0.67 per share in the third quarter versus $0.41 per share in the second quarter. Despite navigating supply chain disruptions and consumer spending fluctuations caused by the administration's erratic policy shifts that have whipsawed markets, the company confidently reaffirmed its 2025 guidance—demonstrating remarkable operational discipline in an unpredictable environment. Starbucks continues to see strong international growth, particularly in China where the company is expanding its footprint despite near-term economic headwinds. The brand's ongoing menu innovation and premium positioning allow it to maintain pricing power even in inflationary environments. The company's rewards program boasts over 30 million active members in the U.S. alone, driving repeat business and higher average tickets. Recent stock price weakness presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, with the company's robust free cash flow supporting both dividend growth and share repurchases. Starbucks' dividend yield currently exceeds historical averages, providing income while investors wait for the growth initiatives to fully materialize.

ByRobert Daugherty ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Moody's lowered the sovereign credit rating of the US, joining S&P and Fitch in stripping America's AAA status. While this is historic and will attract media attention, it reveals what has long been the Federal government's poor governance and management. Spending more than it collects in taxes and lacking the courage to make difficult decisions and think long term. The current administration is admirably trying to right the financial ship. However, its on-again, off-again tariffs will never collect the intended revenue. Additionally, its proposed tax reductions come without corresponding serious spending cuts or addressing entitlement payments. While the Federal government operates under different constraints than states, a comparative fiscal analysis proves instructive. Washington State's prudent financial governance stands in stark contrast to Washington DC's struggle with fiscal discipline. The state maintains exemplary creditworthiness through constitutional balanced budget requirements and strategic reserve mechanisms that have earned it high ratings from credit agencies—precisely the credentials the federal government has now lost. Washington State's economic fundamentals further distinguish it: the state ranks among national leaders in both median household income and GDP per capita. As federal fiscal challenges mount under the weight of escalating debt, Washington State's diversified economy continues to thrive, powered by a formidable technology sector, robust job creation, and sustained investment in innovation that positions the region for continued long-term growth despite broader economic headwinds. Looking specifically at Washington state, one can imagine an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that would likely best the S&P 500 with names like Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Redfin (RDFN) and Weyerhaeuser (WY). For investors seeking above-average long-term equity returns, these value stocks are primed to deliver.

After facing headwinds in recent years from e-commerce competition and pandemic disruptions, Nordstrom is executing a compelling turnaround strategy focused on omnichannel integration and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 05/18 update below. This post was originally published on May 17 Bitcoin has been thrust back into the spotlight by extreme price swings this year, with U.S. president Donald Trump’s assault on the global trade order resulting in wild predictions of total U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has reclaimed $100,000 per bitcoin, topping the closely-watched level even as BlackRock quietly issues a stark bitcoin warning. Now, as crypto traders brace for a perfect storm to hit the bitcoin price, JPMorgan analysts have flipped from gold to bitcoin, predicting the bitcoin price will outperform gold over the rest of 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon remains skeptical of bitcoin and crypto despite the bitcoin ... More price boom over the last few years. "Between mid-February and mid-April gold was rising at the expense of bitcoin, while of the past three weeks we have been observing the opposite, i.e. bitcoin rising at the expense of gold," JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note seen by Decrypt. "In all, we expect the year-to-date zero sum game between gold and bitcoin to extend to the remainder of the year, but are biased towards crypto-specific catalysts creating more upside for bitcoin over gold into the second half of the year." Those "crypto-specific catalysts" include the passage of pro-crypto laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as Trump’s support of the technology. Elsewhere, Wall Street and tech giants are quietly gearing up to blow up the crypto market. 05/18 update: A U.S. bill that would regulate stablecoin issuers, formerly introducing crypto into the established financial system, will be debated by Congress this coming week, with some claiming it’s poised to pass the Senate. The bitcoin price surged to $106,000 per bitcoin on Sunday, climbing to a level not seen since early February and putting it in touching distance of its all-time high of almost $110,000. “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins,” Republican senator Bill Hagerty from Tennessee, who sponsored the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act, said in a statement. After Democrats raised eleventh hour concerns over the bill earlier this month that stemmed from U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration’s links to the crypto world, the bill has been redrafted to satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements, according to a copy seen by Coindesk. “Let’s get this home, we are ready for adoption and to revolutionise the way this financial market works,” Bo Hines, executive director of the president’s council of advisors for digital assets, said during the Consensus crypto conference this week. “We’re actually having these conversations in real-time—I’m extremely confident in the fact that they will get it pushed through, we’d love to see it on the president’s desk. We’re well on our way to achieving the presidents’ goal. We are moving extremely quickly and effectively.” Crypto companies have long been calling for regulation, with Congress under president Joe Biden trying and failing to get rules for stablecoins and issuers passed into law. "The industry wants regulation," investor Ira Auerbach from Offchain Labs said in emailed comments. “The message from those I engage with is clear: Give us the rules of the game and watch innovation flourish.” In April, the JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin’s burgeoning reputation as “digital gold" was under pressure as the bitcoin price failed to hold up in the face extreme market volatility triggered by Trump’s global trade war. The bitcoin price plummeted to around $75,000 per bitcoin, dropping over 30% from its all-time high of almost $110,000, as traders panicked over Trump’s tariffs but has since bounced back to over $100,000. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... More predictions. Bitcoin price bulls have remained upbeat, however, with Miller Value Partners chief investment officer and chairman, Bill Miller IV, telling CNBC the bitcoin price will keep climbing until it eclipses gold’s $20 trillion market capitalization. “Bitcoin’s back in the six-figures with a lot of room to go. If you compare its primary functional use case, a check and a balance on the lack of accountability in fiat unit creation, we still have a long way to go,” Miller said, predicting bitcoin’s “functional superiority” will push it to a price of $1 million per bitcoin. The gold price has hit its own record high this year as investors flee to the traditional safe haven, though it has dipped in recent weeks as the global trade war looks increasingly close to being resolved. With bitcoin’s market capitalization “back above $2 trillion and gold trading north of $3,200/oz, the two now stand side-by-side—as hedges against geopolitical turmoil and, increasingly, as high-conviction stores of value for the future,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Bitcoin Is Headed To $1 Million Thanks To Increasingly Favorable Macro Tailwinds, Says Crypto Legend Hayes

Earlier this month, the price of Bitcoin smashed the $100,000 milestone for the first time since February as U.S. President Donald Trump teased a major trade deal. Now, Arthur Hayes is predicting that the apex crypto will rocket to $1 million in just three years, thanks to macro tailwinds. The former BitMEX CEO reiterated his uber-bullish forecast in his latest blog post. Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could surge to seven figures in a few years, owing to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury, suggesting that Bitcoin will become the preferred haven for investors everywhere. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of U.S. treasuries will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” the BitMEX founder said in his May 15 blog. Hayes timed his forecast to the next US presidential election when a less crypto-friendly president might assume office. “I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs, and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he wrote. “Maybe by some stroke of divine intervention, the American public is ready to accept the monetary hangover for the profligacy of the last century and extinguish the rotten credit destroying their society,” the crypto OG said. “Therefore, the time is now to make hay while the sun king takes a shine to Bitcoin.” Hayes, who was pardoned in late March by U.S. President Trump after having pleaded guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, went on to suggest that Trump will shift gears from tariffs to capital control. This will spook investors, who Hayes thinks will exit the United States with their capital. He reckons the US will print more money in a form similar to quantitative easing to make up for capital leaving the U.S. “It’s the same answer as always,” said Hayes. “If the foreigners won’t supply the dollars, the government will by using its printing press.” As a result, he believes President Trump is likely to shift policies, which will ultimately be a boon for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,” Hayes postulated. Hayes has often maintained that Bitcoin will end up taking off like a rocket due to the U.S.’s monetary policy of printing cash.

Billionaire Warren Buffett just sold about $3.23 billion of Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Citigroup, Bank of America and Capital One. After eliminating Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in recent years, new filings show Buffett continues to place US banks on the chopping block. Berkshire has now also completely exited Citigroup, unloading its remaining 14,639,502 shares worth about $1 billion in Q1 of this year. Meanwhile, the firm unloaded an additional 48.7 million Bank of America shares in Q1, worth about $2.19 billion. Berkshire Hathaway now holds 631,573,531 shares of the financial giant. And Berkshire also dropped about $46,489,000 in Capital One exposure, or 300,000 shares, with the firm now holding onto 7.15 million shares. Buffett’s firm further sold all shares of Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings. Beyond banking, Berkshire reduced positions in Charter Communications, DaVita, T-Mobile and Liberty Media’s Formula One stock. Meanwhile, Buffett boosted investments in Constellation Brands, doubling its stake to over 12 million shares, and added shares in Domino’s Pizza, Heico, VeriSign, Sirius XM, Pool Corp. and Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire’s Apple position remained unchanged. Berkshire’s cash holdings have now ballooned to $350 billion as of March 31st, up from $334 billion at the end of 2024.

Title: Bitcoin ETF allocations drop in Q1 – Is institutional confidence fading?

Will the sluggish Q2 basis trade affect ETF demand and cap BTC’s further rally? Several funds trimmed their Bitcoin [BTC] exposure in Q1 2025. Surprisingly, the state of Wisconsin exited its entire $321 million (100%, orange) in BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), according to recent 13-F filings with the SEC. Source: Fintel (IBIT Q1 2025 allocation) The average portfolio allocation in IBIT dropped by 15.6% in the past quarter, data from Fintel showed. Additionally, Millennium Management LLC slashed its IBIT position by 41% to 17.6 million shares and closed its position in the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). However, the fund added BTC-related exposure from Ark 21Shares and Grayscale Mini. Another hedge fund, Brevan Howard, reduced its IBIT holdings by 15.6%. The rebalancing and reduced exposure weren’t surprising given the market headwinds seen in Q1 2025 amid tariff wars. Over the same period, BTC dropped about 12% in the first three months of the year, up from $109K to $76K. Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan, told Reuters that the cautious approach may be due to reduced basis trade — the price difference (premium) funds get when they buy spot BTC ETF and short CME BTC Futures. He said, “But that premium collapsed and reached its lowest around the end of March. So I’m not surprised to see hedge funds trim their holdings.” Source: Velo (BTC annualized basis trade) The premium was lucrative and hit a whopping 15%-20% annualized returns in late 2024, added Hougan. However, the basis trade sharply dropped below 4% in March, and may partly explain the reduced interest in the products. In Q2 2025, the premium surged to 9% but has slightly eased below 8% at the time of writing. A similar picture was painted by the demand for spot BTC ETFs. In February and March, the products saw over $4B in outflows. Source: Soso Value However, in April and the first half of May, they have seen $5.2 billion in inflows, a renewed demand that lifted BTC above $100K for the first time since February. From a market snapshot, current BTC levels reflected a bull mode seen before the November massive run-up, according to the CryptoQuant Bull Score Index reading of 80. Source: CryptoQuant More inflows into U.S. spot BTC ETFs could rally BTC higher. However, any faltering in demand for the products could likely lead to a local top for the crypto asset. It traded at $103K at press time. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: President Trump in One Word

Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! President Trump’s first international trip was not to a NATO ally, but to the Middle East, because that is where the money is. His trip began in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudis rolled out the lavender carpet for Trump because lavender is the symbol for generosity and Trump was wearing a matching lavender tie. The lavender represents the lavender wild flower blossoming in their desserts. Jesse Watters said in Saudi Arabia, it’s like rapper Lil’ Kim stated, “It’s about money, power and respect.” Jesse says, “That’s Trump’s language.” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, broke protocol and met President Trump on the tarmac. President Trump gave a speech where he stated, A new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts, forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology, not terrorism, and where people of different nations, religions and creeds are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence. [snip] I will never hesitate to wield American power if it’s necessary to defend the United States or to help defend our allies [pointing at the Saudi prince]. And there will be no mercy for any foe who tries to do us or them harm. Trump continued, saying, We have the biggest business leaders in the world here today. They are going to walk away with a lot of checks, a lot of this you are going to provide [looking at the crown prince]. And in the United States, it’s probably about two million jobs we are talking about. Watters reported that “executives from Coca-Cola, Citigroup, IBM, Delta, United, BlackRock, Google and Amazon, all in the desert with Trump… Trump came on a mission to spread money and peace.” The goal of this trip is to secure $1 trillion in investment in the U.S. with $600 billion already secured. After the meetings, the crown prince stated that a phase two will raise the agreements to $1 trillion. Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! Next, Trump was off to visit the nation of Qatar, situated on the border of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar is a semi-constitutional monarchy, where Emir Tamin bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, reigning since 2013, stated, “Together the U.S. and Qatar are feeding and fueling the world. This energy partnership alone is also valued at $1.5 trillion dollars. So, we have been ‘drill baby drilling’ for the last four years.” Looking at President Trump, the Emir continued and said, “And we are glad to have you back on board.” Of the meeting Watters quipped: “Qatar’s pumping oil and sending us the money. $1.2 trillion? Not a bad thing for a day in Doha.” Also, Jesse stated as a result of President Trump’s visit, Qatar put in “the biggest order for Boeing aircraft ever: 210. That’s $100 billion dollars.” But this trip was far more than just a trip about making trillions and billions of dollars for America. Jesse stated, “Trump did something that no U.S. president has done in 25 years. He met with Syria’s president, who used to be a bad guy, but now he’s our bad guy.” Trump shocked the world and lifted sanctions on Syria stating that he was giving them “a chance at greatness.” Jesse stated, “We are trying to peel Syria away from Russia and have them play nice with Israel, and peel Syria away from Iran. The less friends Iran has in the neighborhood, the better chance they sign the nuke deal.” Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! At the Qatar dinner President Trump shook hands with about 400 people and in a speech stated, I hope you can help me with the Iran situation, because it is a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing. We want to do something that’s going to save, maybe millions of lives… We’re really helping the region. We are helping the world. We’re helping your country, and we are trying to get it done, if we can. We are trying to get it done. We have to move quickly, and I just hope Iran realizes what a great friend they have right here [Qatar]. Then Jesse stated, If we can sign a nuke deal with Iran, we can lower sanctions and bring their oil back on line. And when we get the Saudis to pump more oil, it will drive the price down, starve Russia’s war machine and force Putin to the negotiating table, and end the war in Ukraine. We are also selling these Arabs chips and weapons. And if Netanyahu settles the war in Gaza, the Gulf States will re-up the Abraham Accords and we can all do business with Israel. Everyone will be doing business together: Jews, Muslims, and the United States. Moscow will be pushed out of the region. China will be pushed out. And you will have a nice U.S.-sponsored trade alliance with an American security blanket, soft and cozy. Then we can pivot out of that desert back to the Western hemisphere and to the Far East, where the action is. His [Trump’s] main pitch this week is make money not war. Trade goods, not missiles. It’s a ‘Hail Mary,’ but it might work. Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! If all of this were not great enough, Trump then left for the United Arab Emirates, one of the richest countries of all, where he received a hero’s welcome in the palace at Abu Dhabi, UAE. Trump secured a $1.4 trillion business deal and they lit up their city in red, white, and blue to celebrate, but the best was yet to come. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan awarded President Trump with his nation’s highest honor, the Order of Zayed: This is the United Arab Emirates’ highest civil decoration named after the first president of the UAE, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The Order is a necklace made of pure gold, featuring an elaborate design that reflects luxury and appreciation. The main necklace bears the name ‘Zayed’, the founder of the United Arab Emirates, surrounded by decorative details that express the cultural and heritage character of the Emirates. What an honor for an American president. The world is watching in awe while this great free-world leader — leads — with unity, strong love and common-sense peace. How refreshing.

Title: Peter Thiel Shreds $100s and Mocks the Unwashed Masses at Crypto Conference
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/peter-thiel-shreds-100s-and-mocks-the-unwashed-masses-at-crypto-conference/
Time Published: 2025-05-16T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Crypto Gizmodo The billionaire used his Miami Bitcoin 2022 keynote to rip several hundred-dollar bills as an opening bit and lambast the anti-crypto “gerontocracy” of finance. Peter Thiel is a lot of things—a Republican megadonor, an avowed fan of monopolies, and the guy responsible for this website’s former parent company, Gawker Media, going bankrupt some years ago. And if his latest public appearance is any indicator, he’s ready for war. Specifically, war against the powerful old people at establishment financial institutions. At Miami’s Bitcoin 2022 conference on Thursday, Thiel, age 54, kicked off his keynote speech—which you can watch for yourself here—with a clip of himself in 1999 ruminating about the future of cellphones, banks, and digital infrastructure. Then, the real Thiel took the stage and said he’d start his talk the same way he’d start investor pitches in PayPal’s early days: ripping up several hundred dollars and negging onlookers for their naively shocked reactions at the guy who just ripped up several hundred dollars. “Would the gentleman in the front row like to have the money?” He asked, crumpling the bills and tossing the wad to the front row. “I thought you guys were supposed to be Bitcoin maximalists!” Speaking at Bitcoin Miami, Peter Thiel held up a hand full of hundred-dollar bills then threw them into the crowded auditorium, eliciting cheers. "I thought you guys were suppose to be bitcoin maximalists," he said, looking pleased at the commotion. Look, a few hundreds is pocket change to Peter Thiel. He’s a multi-billionaire, meaning $100 amounts to .00001% of his wealth by a conservative estimate. But if that example of absolute Fiscal Alpha Maleness wasn’t enough for you, don’t worry, because things only got more combative from there. After a brief and boring interlude of opining on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Thiel offered his thoughts on why crypto was lacking mainstream adoption. If you asked anyone else that same question, they’d likely offer opinions backed by tangible evidence: that the world’s already buckling technological infrastructure can’t support an energy-sucking Bitcoin wallet in every pocket, or that these currencies are too volatile to be useful for everyday transactions. But if you ask Peter Thiel, the lack of mainstream appreciation is the result of the utter failure, intentional ignorance, and desperate maneuvering of the world’s banks. “Bitcoin is the most honest market in the world. It’s the most efficient market,” Thiel said, “It is telling us that the central banks are bankrupt, that we are at the end of the fiat money regime.” According to Thiel, Bitcoin’s slow adoption is also due to the fact that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is too ungrateful to the gods of digital finance to see the opportunities it presents. “I think the central bankers—Mr. Powell, people like that—should be extremely grateful to Bitcoin,” Thiel went on, “Because it’s the last warning they’re going to get. They’ve chosen to ignore it, and they will have to pay the consequences for that in the years ahead.” Thiel himself isn’t known as an especial Bitcoin bull. He said in the very same Miami address that he wished he had bought into the cryptocurrency earlier. In the same vein, Powell has not made a particular enemy of Bitcoin. The regulator has expressed that he has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies and even agrees that they could very well make electronic payments cheaper and faster. Why Thiel is going after Powell now may have something to do with the Paypal founder’s preferred presidential candidate. After secretly bankrolling a lawsuit against Gizmodo’s former owner Gawker Media, resulting in the company’s bankruptcy, the tech investor was one of the only prominent members of Silicon Valley to publicly endorse Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign. Trump nominated Powell to his post but would go on to cultivate a bitter feud with him. Trump railed against Powell as “a fail” with “no guts, no sense, no vision” whom people were “VERY disappointed in” at every turn. The day before the keynote, The New York Times reported that Thiel had joined forces with Republican megadonor and alt-right funder Rebekah Mercer to finance political candidates who were more radically right-wing than the reigning Republican Party. Instead of breaking all that down though, Thiel cast Bitcoin in do-or-die, us-vs-them terms. Bitcoin, he said, “is a movement, and it’s a political question whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether the enemies of the movement will succeed in stopping us.” The last five minutes of his talk were, of course, dedicated to dunking on these enemies, which he called the “gerontocracy.” In order, the Old Men of Finance on Thiel’s shitlist are: Warren Buffett, who is “enemy number one” and “a sort of sociopathic grandpa from Omaha,” according to Thiel JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and the rest of the “New York City banker boys” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Judging by sympathetic attendees’ tweets, it seemed few were concerned about framing crypto’s growth as a cultural and political war. In fact, they welcomed it. Perhaps they knew what was coming. Eric Weinstein, a managing director at Thiel Capital, wrote of the address, “Peter Thiel making a clear declaration in Miami: the Financial Gerontocracy has declared war on Bitcoin as a revolutionary youth movement for good reason. It is thus time the revolutionary youth should understand their enemies & return fire.” Crypto Crypto Crypto Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: What To Buy Before Tariffs Raise The Price Of Everything

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, we have seen prices rise and the stock market fall. Then we saw tariff delays leading to stock market surges, even as a massive tariff was placed on Chinese imports. This was followed by framework trade deal agreements with assorted nations, dramatically lowered tariffs on China due to the beginning of bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and China, and a shipping container’s worth of general uncertainty and unease. Despite this, what is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise if they have not already, even if not so much as initially feared. That’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance experts to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Tariffs generally fall into two categories: Baseline and reciprocal. Each has a different strategic purpose for the levier, and impact on those levied. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government, though tentative deals with select nations (such as the United Kingdom) may soon bring those down for some global partners. Few elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. As for what goods are affected, Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business, says: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Shortly after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” To understand the impact of tariffs on consumer goods, it’s important to first define the broader context of trade in the United States. “The U.S. trades a lot and imports a lot,” says Sarada, Ph.D. and adjunct assistant professor of strategy at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. "Imports include raw building materials, electronics such as computers and phones, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, machinery and equipment, cars and car parts, clothing, footwear, fruit, tree nuts, coffee and so much more." Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, adds that because of this reliance on imports, plus the ways the tariffs have been imposed, he expects that "nearly everything will increase in price.” He goes on: “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. As the tariff landscape continues to fluctuate, so too will the retailers affected by this change, as will the timing of the impact on the larger consumer marketplace. For example, China was briefly levied with a formidable 145% tariff rate, which saw countless shipping containers full of thousands of dollars worth of goods simply stop their forward progress toward the American consumer. Lower-value shipments, such as those from Shein and Temu, also seemed poised to slow dramatically. That’s because the large volume of direct-to-consumer shipments from companies like these, worth less than $800, have, until now, been exempt from tariff fees. This was because of a rule known as the “de minimis exemption.” According to an official White House press release: “On average, CBP [Customs and Border Protection] processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.” As of May 2, 2025, that exemption is no more, and even these smaller shipments were expected to be assessed with import fees. Along with that initial 145% tariff, it looked like shipments could cost the consumer more than double the expense expected at the time of the order. Now, with American tariffs on Chinese imports lowered to 30% for at least most of the summer, prices may stay more manageable than expected, these low-cost retailers are likely to retain a decent share of the American market. All that said, reduced tariffs on China and framework trade deals with trading partners around the globe are likely not enough to head off price increases in the short term and the lingering chance of recession. As an example, Walmart, still the world’s largest retailer, is planning to raise prices soon. While many products Walmart sells are produced domestically in the United States—including much of the food and grocery items the retail giant offers—its assortment of toys, electronics and other major sellers for the company are overwhelmingly made in China. Even the temporary 30% increase on tariffs will impact the prices Americans pay. While we saw some price increases in anticipation of the tariffs and some shortly after they hit, the majority of the price jumps will take place months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the early summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. Given how interconnected the American economy is to the global world beyond, the impact of tariffs will undoubtedly be felt across industries and continents, from financial markets to factories and beyond. From a purely domestic perspective, Sarada explains it like this: “Tariffs, the production of goods and services, prices, portfolio values, employment and salaries are all intertwined. Once there is volatility or uncertainty [due to] tariffs, then we can expect uncertainties across these different aspects of the economy. When there is uncertainty, a small fraction of economic agents, like some types of traders and fund managers, wealthy individuals and some entrepreneurs can seize the opportunity to shift resources quickly into markets that are dropping and then cash out when they rise.” Further, some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Sarada adds: “Most people respond to uncertainty in the economy by pulling back." And as for how soon this might occur, exactly “when people will start pulling back depends on what they experience—whether they start losing jobs, see portfolios fall in value for a sustained period or stop receiving wage increases or bonuses.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

Title: Gerry Thornley: IRFU decision on Sevens reflects the cold, hard business of sport

Full Content:
Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley News that the IRFU are to cut the men’s Sevens programme at the end of this season doesn’t come as a surprise given their funding had already been reduced and that they had been very much a pet product of the previous Performance Director, David Nucifora. Even so, the bottom line is that it’s very sad news and even a little cold and cruel given distinguished and future Sevens careers have been stopped. Alas, the biggest problem on David Humphreys’ in-tray since succeeding Nucifora is the widening gap between Leinster and the other three provinces, and the new Performance Director has had his hands tied further by the Union’s losses of €18 million over the course of the 2023-24 season. Cutting the men’s Sevens programme is not necessarily a huge saving, although it could be around the €400,000 mark. It is estimated that the programme costs the IRFU in the region of €1.35m in total, but this is partially offset by the estimated €350,000 they received from World Rugby for playing in the world series, and Olympic funding from Sport Ireland of €300,000 as well as around €300,000 in sponsorship from Tritonlake, as title sponsors, and Blackrock as associate sponsors. In coming to this decision, the IRFU maintain that the Men’s Sevens programme does not, in essence, provide a pathway through to the national 15-a-side team. It’s true that it certainly doesn’t in the same way that the women’s Sevens programme is a vital lifeblood of the Ireland women’s 15-a-side team in the absence of the four provinces which supply the men’s 15-a-side team. Similarly, the men’s Sevens sides are a pathway for the likes of Argentina, Samoa and Kenya but also in the absence of four professional feeder provinces ala Ireland. Even so, while the debate will rage as to how much the Sevens programme helped or delayed the development of Hugo Keenan, Jimmy O’Brien, Nick Timoney and others, there’s little doubt that, for example, Cormac Izuchukwu would not have ended up playing for Ulster and Ireland without being brought into the Sevens fold. One wonders if this decision would have been made had Ireland won a medal at the Olympics, where they lost by four points to the back-to-back gold medallists. It remains to be seen if this relative drop in the ocean will help to improve Connacht, Munster and Leinster bridge that gap with Leinster, although in truth all four provinces never had much love for an Ireland Sevens team that took away some of their players. The former Ireland Sevens captain Billy Dardis has described the move as “short-sighted” and “hugely deflating”, while the Rugby Players of Ireland CEO Simon Keogh has highlighted the bad timing of this announcement and how challenging it will be for the players to find clubs in the 15s game. One imagines that Sport Ireland will not be enamoured or impressed by the IRFU’s decision and the thought occurs that there should be, perhaps, a two-year Olympic qualifying cycle which is at least partially separate from the World Series. The Ireland Men’s Sevens team are also a victim of the world series no linger having the reach it used to have when it was televised by Sky Sports, meaning in latter years it has had to be streamed online. True, England, Wales and Scotland only contribute to a combined Great Britain team and the Ireland Men’s Sevens team always portrayed a good image and were a good reflection of Irish rugby. Having risen to number two in the world, it seems a real shame that they have been cast adrift. Across every facet of business and life there are loss-makers which need to be supported but, ultimately, it feels like this cold, money-based decision reflects the world we live in.

Title: From Redmond to Bengaluru: How Microsoft’s India-first AI agenda exported America’s future
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2025/05/from-redmond-to-bengaluru-how-microsofts-india-first-ai-agenda-exported-americas-future/

By Amanda Bartolotta May 16, 2025 Microsoft has quietly filed notice with its home state of Washington that 2,000 jobs will be cut at its Redmond headquarters beginning July 13. The layoffs, according to the May 13 announcement, are part of a broader downsizing strategy to “reduce management layers.” There was no press conference. No apologies. Just a bureaucratic filing that confirmed what many American workers already suspected – that their jobs are no longer essential to the company they helped build. Yet lurking beneath the surface of this corporate downsizing is a sweeping corporate realignment with global and geopolitical implications. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! For while Microsoft is cutting thousands of jobs in the United States, the company is simultaneously executing its most aggressive expansion ever into a single foreign nation: India. From billion-dollar investments in AI infrastructure to skilling programs to government partnerships and cloud capacity, Microsoft is actively repositioning India, not the United States, as the centerpiece of its AI empire. How Microsoft is using AI to replace American labor and redirect investment overseas Globally, Microsoft is on pace to spend $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers to power its AI future. But that investment isn’t fueling jobs in America, it’s powering layoffs. Microsoft executives admitted at a recent JPMorgan conference that “AI is saving us hundreds of millions a year” by replacing human labor in customer support alone. But what the company won’t say publicly is this: The AI revolution they’re funding isn’t just about innovation, it’s about offshoring – about products and services being designed, deployed and expanded in India, funded by U.S. dollars and built using technologies born in America. The very business models pioneered in the United States are now being used to undercut the American workforce and hollow out the very economy that fuels Microsoft’s success and the bulk of its revenue. In 2024, Microsoft earned $124.70 billion from the United States, accounting for 50.87% of its total earnings. In contrast, India contributed just $2.74 billion, a mere 1.12%. Yet India is where the company is placing its biggest bets. How Microsoft turned its back on American workers This isn’t Microsoft’s first move in this direction. In 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees, nearly 5% of its global workforce, while quietly ramping up hiring overseas. In a company-wide email, CEO Satya Nadella tried to soften the blow: “While we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas.” Left unsaid was that these “strategic areas” were overwhelmingly outside the U.S. and largely excluded Americans. As U.S.-based engineers, project managers and customer service teams were handed pink slips, Microsoft expanded its international footprint with no such downsizing abroad. In fact, the company’s head of India and South Asia, Puneet Chandok, made it clear in a press interview that there would be no layoffs in India. AI empire: Made in India Just months earlier, Microsoft’s Nadella stood on stage in Bengaluru to announce the company’s largest-ever foreign investment, $3 billion to build out AI infrastructure in India. This includes expanding data centers, cloud capacity and an aggressive AI workforce training program that will “skill” 10 million people in India by 2030, 2.4 million of whom were already trained in the past year. The announcement, made with little fanfare in the United States, was the largest foreign investment Microsoft has made in more than a decade. “India is rapidly becoming a leader in AI innovation. … These investments in infrastructure and skilling … reaffirm our commitment to making India AI-first,” Nadella said during a press conference hosted by the Indian government. Microsoft’s president of India and South Asia, Puneet Chandok, added: “Today’s announcement strengthens our belief in India’s potential and our resolve to equip the country with the resources and future-ready skills needed to excel in the global marketplace.” Chandok extolled Microsoft’s “commitment to copiloting India on its journey to become an AI-first nation.” Microsoft’s partnership is with the IndiaAI Mission, the Indian government’s flagship program that explicitly aims to dominate global AI applications by attracting foreign capital, embedding Indian infrastructure into international systems and forging deep partnerships with U.S. tech giants like Microsoft. India: ‘the world’s leading nation’? India has made no secret of its ambition to become a global economic superpower by 2047, and Microsoft is helping make it happen. India’s strategy is straightforward: Attract foreign capital, embed Indian infrastructure into global systems and acquire leadership through international partnerships, not organic innovation. As scientist and international speaker Dr. Pratik Mungekar has plainly declared, “In the quest for global supremacy and recognition, India has set its sights on a momentous goal – to claim the mantle of the world’s leading nation by 2047.” While Microsoft openly fuels India’s ambitions abroad, in the U.S. the American-born company is selling a different narrative. In a January 2025 blog post titled “The Golden Opportunity for American AI,” Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith outlines what appears to be a patriotic call to action: Invest in U.S. infrastructure, protect American innovation and promote AI leadership on the world stage. Smith opens with praise for President Trump’s 2019 executive order on AI, which emphasized securing critical technologies and protecting America’s AI edge from strategic competitors like China. At first glance, the message appears aligned with U.S. interests and like a national strategy. In reality, it’s a veiled push for India. For while Smith invokes President Trump’s 2019 executive order emphasizing the importance of protecting America’s technological advantage in AI from “strategic competitors and adversarial nations,” just paragraphs later, the blog downplays these protections, calling instead for a race to “spread American AI to allies and friends” and urging U.S. policymakers to empower companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon to expand their global infrastructure with fewer regulatory constraints. While claiming to support American leadership, then, the real message is clear: Move fast, bypass red tape and expand overseas, especially to countries like India. What’s left out is the glaring contradiction. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others have already invested heavily in India, building cloud regions, establishing AI labs and embedding their technologies across India’s digital economy. These aren’t emerging opportunities, they’re established footholds. And now, under the guise of “exporting American AI,” Microsoft is lobbying Washington to support and accelerate that shift even further. Meanwhile, the supposed urgency of outpacing China is being used as a fear-based distraction. Smith’s “Golden Opportunity for American AI” blog warns that China is rapidly expanding its AI capabilities and building infrastructure in developing countries, using subsidies and strategic partnerships. But what it fails to acknowledge is that India has adopted a similar playbook, positioning itself not through organic innovation, but through foreign acquisition, talent funnels and massive foreign-backed infrastructure builds. India’s track record of intellectual property misuse, reverse engineering and tech transfer through partnerships has been well-documented. The U.S. Trade Representative has consistently placed India on its Priority Watch List, citing ongoing challenges in intellectual property enforcement and protection, highlighting in some reports issues like inadequate trade secret protection and the absence of specific civil or criminal laws addressing trade secret misappropriation in India. Indeed, in sectors like defense and aerospace, India has repeatedly used strategic partnerships to absorb, replicate and redeploy foreign technologies. These practices are not anomalies, they’re part of a documented pattern. Yet Microsoft, in its bid for global expansion, turns a blind eye, insists the U.S. must protect critical AI systems from “adversarial acquisition,” while doing exactly that. Conclusion: Act now, or America’s AI future will be ‘Made in India’ At a time when American workers are being laid off in record numbers and the very industries they built are slipping away, Microsoft has shown the world exactly where its loyalty lies – and it’s not with the country that gave it life. Behind polished blog posts and patriotic slogans lies a calculated shift: an offshoring blueprint disguised as innovation, fueled by U.S. dollars and aligned with a foreign nation that has openly vowed to outpace the West. This isn’t just a corporate betrayal, it’s a surrender of American leadership, a silent handover of the future to a geopolitical rival cloaked as an ally. Microsoft’s AI empire isn’t being built in Redmond, it’s being constructed in Bengaluru, brick by brick, as part of India’s grand strategy to dominate the global tech order by 2047. If Americans doesn’t recognize the cost of this betrayal soon, the “golden opportunity” won’t belong to them. It will have already been outsourced, packaged, exported and claimed by a country that was never meant to lead Americans’ future.

VANCOUVER, BC, May 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – AI is no longer just assisting healthcare — it's beginning to rewire it from the ground up. From streamlining diagnostics and automating clinical documentation to predicting disease and optimizing hospital operations, generative AI is now touching every layer of the care continuum. As policymakers in places like Connecticut debate how to regulate this growing influence, and initiatives like OpenAI's HealthBench push the frontier of model evaluation, a new class of enterprise-scale innovators is already moving ahead. Among them are several public companies straddling health tech, cloud AI, and data infrastructure — including Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR), GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: GEHC), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE: CRM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL). Industry analysts at MarketsandMarkets project that the AI in healthcare market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 38.6%, reaching over $110 billion by 2030. Looking further ahead, Accenture estimates that AI could unlock an additional $461 billion in value by 2035—augmenting a global healthcare sector already expected to exceed $2.26 trillion. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) is quietly but deliberately advancing its position in AI-powered healthcare through a proposed acquisition of its joint venture partner, Ainnova Tech. The two companies, already aligned under the Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC) banner, are now moving to unify operations—an intentional step that comes just ahead of their scheduled FDA pre-submission meeting this July. If completed, the merger would remove internal friction, streamline clinical trial planning, and strengthen their regulatory posture ahead of potential U.S. market entry. "We believe bringing the two companies together will offer tremendous value for shareholders," said Vinicio Vargas, CEO at Ainnova and a member of the Board of Directors of Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. "It will simplify the process of advancing our technology to market, and it will deliver value to our customers and partners as we promote our technology portfolio globally." At the core of this effort is Vision AI, a non-invasive clinical screening platform that combines retinal imaging, vital sign capture, and machine-learning algorithms to detect early signals of chronic illness—including diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, kidney and liver conditions, and type 2 diabetes. Operating under AAC, the joint venture holds global rights to the platform, which has shown more than 90% sensitivity in early detection, according to NIH-cited research. "This milestone reflects our two-tiered strategy, rapid deployment in low-regulation markets where Vision AI operates as a screening tool, and simultaneous progress toward FDA clearance for the U.S. market," said Vargas. "Entering the U.S. will unlock significant commercial potential, and early engagement with regulators ensures we do so with speed, credibility, and a validated product." Unlike many healthcare AI startups still stuck at concept stage, Avant's technology is already deployed in Latin America—including Chile, Mexico, and Brazil—where it's being tested in real-world clinical workflows. These field programs are not only helping build a safety and efficacy track record, they're also providing critical user feedback that shapes the platform's refinement and usability. To support broader clinical reach, AAC recently integrated four new diagnostic algorithms into Vision AI. Trained on over 2.3 million clinical cases, these additions enhance the system's utility across a wider range of chronic conditions.

VANCOUVER, BC, May 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – AI is no longer just assisting healthcare — it's beginning to rewire it from the ground up. From streamlining diagnostics and automating clinical documentation to predicting disease and optimizing hospital operations, generative AI is now touching every layer of the care continuum. As policymakers in places like Connecticut debate how to regulate this growing influence, and initiatives like OpenAI's HealthBench push the frontier of model evaluation, a new class of enterprise-scale innovators is already moving ahead. Among them are several public companies straddling health tech, cloud AI, and data infrastructure — including Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR), GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: GEHC), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE: CRM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL). Industry analysts at MarketsandMarkets project that the AI in healthcare market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 38.6%, reaching over $110 billion by 2030. Looking further ahead, Accenture estimates that AI could unlock an additional $461 billion in value by 2035—augmenting a global healthcare sector already expected to exceed $2.26 trillion. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) is quietly but deliberately advancing its position in AI-powered healthcare through a proposed acquisition of its joint venture partner, Ainnova Tech. The two companies, already aligned under the Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC) banner, are now moving to unify operations—an intentional step that comes just ahead of their scheduled FDA pre-submission meeting this July. If completed, the merger would remove internal friction, streamline clinical trial planning, and strengthen their regulatory posture ahead of potential U.S. market entry. "We believe bringing the two companies together will offer tremendous value for shareholders," said Vinicio Vargas, CEO at Ainnova and a member of the Board of Directors of Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. "It will simplify the process of advancing our technology to market, and it will deliver value to our customers and partners as we promote our technology portfolio globally." At the core of this effort is Vision AI, a non-invasive clinical screening platform that combines retinal imaging, vital sign capture, and machine-learning algorithms to detect early signals of chronic illness—including diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, kidney and liver conditions, and type 2 diabetes. Operating under AAC, the joint venture holds global rights to the platform, which has shown more than 90% sensitivity in early detection, according to NIH-cited research. "This milestone reflects our two-tiered strategy, rapid deployment in low-regulation markets where Vision AI operates as a screening tool, and simultaneous progress toward FDA clearance for the U.S. market," said Vargas. "Entering the U.S. will unlock significant commercial potential, and early engagement with regulators ensures we do so with speed, credibility, and a validated product." Unlike many healthcare AI startups still stuck at concept stage, Avant's technology is already deployed in Latin America—including Chile, Mexico, and Brazil—where it's being tested in real-world clinical workflows. These field programs are not only helping build a safety and efficacy track record, they're also providing critical user feedback that shapes the platform's refinement and usability. To support broader clinical reach, AAC recently integrated four new diagnostic algorithms into Vision AI. Trained on over 2.3 million clinical cases, these additions enhance the system's utility across a wider range of chronic conditions. With proven traction abroad and a pending regulatory milestone in the U.S., Avant is moving from potential to presence—and may soon find itself on the radar of a much larger healthcare conversation.

Title: Final BusConnects corridor secures planning permission
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/05/16/final-busconnects-corridor-secures-planning-permission/
Time Published: 2025-05-16T17:33:18Z
Full Content:
The final BusConnects corridor has been approved by An Bord Pleanála almost two years after the application was made and more than 10 years on from the project being announced. The Kimmage to Dublin city centre route is the last of 12 corridors to receive permission under the €4 billion scheme to transform the capital’s bus services. However, six routes remain the subject of judicial review proceedings. The BusConnects programme has two strands: a network redesign and the 12 bus corridors. Unlike the redesign project, which involves the reorganisation of services on existing road infrastructure, the corridors require construction to achieve segregation of bus and cycle lanes from traffic. This, in some instances, necessitates road widening, the acquisition of property, including parts of front gardens, and the felling of trees. The route from Kimmage in southwest Dublin to the city centre, via Harold’s Cross and Clanbrassil Street, is one of the shorter corridors at just 3.7km, but it has been the longest in the planning system. A complex route, it involved the design of four “bus gates”, two of which ban private traffic on a 24-hour basis, while the others are to be in force during morning and evening peak times. [ BusConnects corridor construction to begin in autumnOpens in new window ] The bus-only sections of road, which will involve diversions for private traffic, were introduced to the designs following local protests over the original scheme, which involved significant annexing of parts of front gardens and the felling of a large number of trees. The scheme, which now involves reduced property acquisition and tree removal, includes two new footbridges over the Grand Canal in Portobello and a pedestrian/cyclist boardwalk over the river Poddle in Kimmage. The route was the subject of three rounds of public consultation before the application was made by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in July 2023. More than 80 submissions were made to the board after the application was lodged, and while several were supportive, many residents objected to the traffic diversions that would be imposed through the use of bus gates. Of the 12 corridors, five now have “full” planning permission and can no longer be challenged in the courts. These are the routes from Ballymun/Finglas, Liffey Valley, Ringsend, Tallaght/Clondalkin and Lucan. Judicial review proceedings are ongoing in relation to six schemes, these are the corridors from Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Blanchardstown, Templeogue/Rathfarnham Swords and Bray. It remains to be seen if legal action will be taken against the Kimmage scheme. Construction of the first two corridors had been due to start this autumn, but the NTA now says it expects to be in a position to move forward at an earlier stage. Work is due to start on the Ballymun/Finglas and Liffey Valley routes by the middle of the year. Each route is expected to take about two years to complete. “Reaching this milestone on the BusConnects infrastructure programme is a very positive development,” a NTA spokesman said. “It’s good news for bus customers, good news for communities and good news for the city. It is also welcome from the cyclists point of view, with 200km of cycle tracks to be delivered across the 12 schemes.” Plans for a system of segregated, continuous bus lanes for Dublin were first announced in 2014. In 2017, the NTA published the potential routes for these core bus corridors – which it hoped to have completed by the end of 2019. The government gave the NTA sanction to seek planning approval for the routes in March 2022 and the first applications were made from mid-2022. The Liffey Valley corridor was the first route to secure planning permission in December 2023. Olivia Kelly is Dublin Editor of The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Key Moments From Trump’s Whirlwind Tour of the Middle East

Reporter Reporter President Donald Trump has wrapped up his three-country tour of the Middle East, during which significant moves were made to transform the United States’ relationship with the region. The President solidified investment agreements, conducted the first meeting between U.S. and Syrian Presidents in 25 years, hinted at the potential for a nuclear deal with Iran, and much more. Trump kickstarted his visit on Tuesday, May 13, when he landed in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, and was greeted by luxury at the Royal Saudi Palace. He signed deals and agreements worth billions of dollars, covering a number of industries. Advertisement Advertisement Qatar was Trump’s next stop. He landed in the capital city of Doha on Wednesday, May 14. Another flurry of agreements were made—including a $96 billion Boeing deal—followed by a roundtable with business leaders, where Trump resurfaced his idea of a U.S. takeover of the Gaza strip. Trump arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, May 15, for the final leg of his tour, during which he signed an agreement on AI worth around $1.4 trillion. Read More: From Fighter Jet Escorts to the Gifting of Oil, the Most Memorable Photos of Trump’s Middle East TourReflecting on his trip, Trump lamented that future Presidents may well take credit for what he has achieved. “Somebody’s going to be taking the credit for this. You remember, press, this guy did it,” Trump told reporters during the flight home on Air Force One. As Trump returns to Washington, D.C., here’s a look back at the key moments from his whirlwind tour of the Middle East: Trump’s trip started off with a glitzy welcome from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The President was joined by Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) lead Elon Musk, as well as other important U.S. business figures including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. In Riyadh, Trump announced that the U.S. had agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion. The two leaders also signed agreements on security and intelligence cooperation, technology, and energy. The White House has said that Saudi investments signed during Trump’s visit are worth a total of $600 billion. In an unexpected announcement during a U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday, May 13, Trump said he plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, some of which have been in place for over 45 years. Trump called the sanctions “brutal and crippling,” but noted their necessity before the collapse of the Bashar Assad regime in December 2024. Trump said that now, in this new era, it’s time for Syria to “shine.” Many experts, including Benjamin Feve, a senior research analyst at Karam Shaar Advisory, have said that Trump’s plan to list the sanctions may not be straightforward. “He [Trump] cannot just declare it, you have to go through a specific process which involves barriers in the Administration. You have the Secretary of State, the Treasury, Congress,” Feve tells TIME. “They have to be re-thought, redesigned in order to continue who they will be imposed upon.” The collapse of the Assad regime in December occurred when Ahmed al-Sharaa’s group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led a rebel coalition. Assad fled Syria with his family and sought asylum in Russia. HTS has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, and al-Sharaa had a $10 million reward for his arrest placed on him by the U.S. government, before it was lifted in December. On Wednesday, May 14, Trump and al-Sharaa met in Riyadh. They were accompanied by the Saudi Crown Prince, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined remotely via telephone. Talking to reporters afterwards on Air Force One, Trump described the Syrian leader, a former militant, as a "young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter… He’s got a real shot at holding it together.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later revealed that Trump had urged al-Sharaa to normalise ties with Israel, clamp down on terrorism in Syria, and work with the U.S. to stop any resurgence of ISIS. Read More: Trump Meets With Syria’s President After Announcing Plans to Lift U.S. Sanctions on Country Trump’s plan to accept a luxury Boeing from Qatar had caused controversy before the President left for his tour of the Gulf. Valued at roughly $400 million, the gifted plane—and the potential of Trump going through with accepting it—has raised ethical, legal, and security concerns.“He’s going to turn Air Force One into Bribe Force One,” Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts told TIME. “Congress has to be involved with such a clear threat to our national security.” Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, also raised concerns. Read More: Trump Doubles Down on Plan to Receive Qatar’s Plane Gift: ‘Only a Fool Would Not Accept This’ But the President has doubled down on his intentions to accept the plane, which he says will be used as a temporary Air Force One while two more jets are still in production to replace current models. In a May 14 post on his social media platform, TruthSocial, Trump said: “The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME! It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years… “Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our country.” He also defended his stance during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Air Force One. Qatar’s Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani gave his take on the gift controversy during an interview with CNN. “It’s still under legal review. I don’t know why it became so big as news… We have done a lot together with the U.S.,” he said, adding that it was just a case of “very simple government-to-government dealing.” When asked whether this was an instance of “buying influence” with the U.S., the Qatari leader said: “Why would we buy influence in the United States? If you look at the last 10 years of the U.S.-Qatar relationship, Qatar has always been there for the U.S. when it's needed... We believe this friendship needs to be mutually-beneficial for both countries. It cannot be a one-way relationship.” A notable absence from Trump’s list of stops during his Middle East tour was Israel, but the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has still been a central point of discussion for the President. Trump expressed hope for the “safety and dignity” for Palestinians in Gaza during a Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in Riyadh on Wednesday. The next morning, at a roundtable discussion with business leaders in Doha, Trump once again raised his idea for a U.S. takeover of Gaza. It's an idea that has been previously condemned by many world leaders, as it would likely involve the displacement of the entire Palestinian population. “I think I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone,” Trump said. “They’ve never solved the Gaza problem and if you look at it, I have aerial shots, I mean there’s practically no building standing, there’s no building. People are living under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, which is not acceptable, it's tremendous death. And I want to see that be a freedom zone.” Trump’s remarks came amid another series of airstrikes on Gaza. Israel has previously announced plans to expand military occupation over the entire Gaza Strip indefinitely. Read More: Trump Suggests U.S. Should ‘Take’ Gaza and Turn It Into a ‘Freedom Zone’ The President’s trip to the Gulf also involved discussions on Iran and the potential progress of a deal with the country. In his first term, Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal the Obama Administration had secured with Iran after years of negotiations. “I want to make a deal,” Trump said Wednesday during the GCC Summit. He stipulated that a deal would be dependent on Iran halting its support for terrorism and fueling proxy wars in the region, as well as the country not having nuclear weapons. In an interview with NBC on Wednesday, Ali Shamkhani—a key political, military and nuclear adviser to the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—said that the country is ready to sign a nuclear deal with the U.S., subject to conditions. Shamkhani said that if a deal were to take place, Iran would not make nuclear weapons, would reduce stockpiles of enriched uranium to a level only needed for civilian use, and would allow international inspectors to supervise the process. In return, all economic sanctions on Iran would need to be lifted. Shamkhani said that if those conditions were met, Iran would sign an agreement on the day. During Thursday’s roundtable in Doha, Trump said that talks between Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, and Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s Foreign Affairs Minister, were progressing as “very serious negotiations.” However, Araghchi later said that enriching uranium was a core right for Iran and it was a red line regarding negotiations. On Friday, after departing the UAE, his final stop of the tour, Trump said that Iran had received a proposal from the U.S. regarding the nuclear programme. Talking to reporters on Air Force One, he said: “They have a proposal, but more importantly, they know that they have to move quickly, or something bad, something bad’s gonna happen.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: AI leaders stare down limits as they keep spending big

UPDATED 11:24 EDT / MAY 16 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Initial public offerings of stock inched back this week as eToro’s IPO soared 29% over its initial price, Chime filed and Pony AI in China filed confidentially. But don’t expect a full-scale return in this choppy economy. Herald the coming of the software-only cloud hyperscaler — starting with Salesforce. AI leaders suddenly are confronting reality — excessive hype and high expense, not to mention diverging interests and doubts about the headroom for cutting-edge AI such as reasoning models. Meta even reportedly is delaying its latest mega-model after it didn’t show enough improvement, and it’s not alone. But they all still expect a big payoff from the continuing stream of new models from Google DeepMind, OpenAI and more, and from AI services — some, such as Box’s and Boomi’s, providing crucial deeper links to enterprise data and processes. For now, many AI and data companies are still raking in big rounds, such as Perplexity and AI21 Labs, along with Anthropic closing a $2 billion debt facility — honestly it’s kind of exhausting, as you can see below. And they’re spending that cash, such as Databricks buying Neon for $1 billion. Then there’s Saudi Arabia’s big multibillion-dollar AI play, Humain, with Nvidia, AMD and Amazon feeding at the Mideast trough. But not everyone’s making bank — Cohere’s revenue reportedly came in very low — so you have to think investors are going to start getting pickier at some point. Quantum computing still seems years off from real commercial potential, but that’s not stopping investors from pouring money into quantum startups such as Classiq. Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook how to do business. Cook wisely ignores him, no doubt waiting for him to forget it once the next distraction comes along. A huge event week is coming up, with Computex, Dell Tech World (check out Dave Vellante’s deep dive on Dell’s strategy in his latest Breaking Analysis), Red Hat Summit, Microsoft Build, Google I/O and commercetools Elevate, most of which will be covered by SiliconANGLE and most of them onsite by theCUBE and theCUBE Research as well. And there are a few important earnings reports next week as well: Palo Alto Networks, Snowflake, Zoom, Workday and Autodesk. You can hear more about this and other tech news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Salesforce Agentforce and Data Cloud: A path to the software-only hyperscaler In the race to deploy AI, industry leaders confront hype and expense – but project a promising future OpenAI and Microsoft engage in tense negotiations over the future of their partnership Meta set to postpone release of Llama 4 Behemoth model, report claims Are AI reasoning models reaching limits already?

Title: State Of Wisconsin Dumped Entire Spot Bitcoin ETF Stake Amid Tariff Uncertainty

Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to offload its entire Bitcoin (BTC) bet during the first quarter of the year, weeks before President Trump’s economic tariffs sparked a crypto market downturn. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which oversees the state’s retirement funds, no longer owns shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). According to a Thursday 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal quarter ending in March, the Wisconsin Investment Board quietly unloaded all 6,060,351 IBIT shares it reported holding from the previous quarter. At the time, the over 6 million IBIT shares were worth around $335.9 million. The SWIB in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a Bitcoin ETF purchase, acquiring $164 million worth of BTC exchange-traded funds in Q1 2024 — the same quarter the Bitcoin products went live in the US. The fund’s mass sell-off of its IBIT shares comes against the backdrop of increasing market uncertainty sparked by a slew of U.S. tariffs that unnerved global trade and risk assets. Notably, the filing’s deadline, March 31, came just two days before President Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ on April 2, 2025, when the U.S. imposed sweeping tariffs affecting almost all its major trading partners. IBIT remains the market’s biggest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by assets under management at approximately $65 billion. The fund extended its dominance by registering an impressive 20-day streak of positive flows. Net inflows for the BlackRock-issued product crossed the $45.5 billion milestone on May 14 after drawing in $232.9 million in investor money. While the State of Wisconsin was selling, Mubadala Investment Company, one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, boosted its BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings, signaling sustained institutional interest in crypto-related assets despite recent market volatility. In its 13F filing with the SEC on Thursday, Mubadala Investment Company revealed that it had added 491,439 shares of BlackRock’s IBIT during Q1, currently worth roughly $29 million. The BTC ETF purchase in Q1 pushed its total IBIT holdings to 8,726,972 as of March 31 from 8,235,533 at the end of December. As ZyCrypto recently reported, Goldman Sachs is currently the biggest holder of IBIT with 30.8 million shares, worth around $1.4 billion as of March 31.

Title: General Mills: Defensive Play With 8%+ Yield & Strong Upside Potential
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/16/general-mills-defensive-play-with-8-yield--strong-upside-potential/
Time Published: 2025-05-16T14:37:26Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Golden Valley, USA - January 18, 2015: General Mills corporate headquarters and sign. General Mills, ... More Inc. is an American multinational Fortune 500 corporation food products conglomerate. A few up days does not mean volatility won’t return. In fact, I think most investors expect more market turbulence in the future, not less. And, the best way to defend your portfolio against a volatile market is to do your diligence. Diligence brings you opportunities while less rigorous investors are left to panic. For example, this week’s Long Idea is an opportunity to bolster your portfolio with a safe, high-quality stock. I previously made General Mills, Inc. (GIS) a Long Idea in December 2019, in large part because of its understated profits. While the stock has underperformed since then, it still earns an Attractive rating and provides strong and safe dividend yield in an increasingly volatile market. General Mills, while certainly not a flashy high-flying name, operates a stable business that generates billons in free cash flow, which management consistently returns to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. As investors look for safety in an uncertain time, GIS could be the safe haven to ride out the storm. General Mills leverages its leading market position to consistently grow profits, even if revenue doesn’t always follow suit over the long-term. The company has grown revenue by 1% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 3% compounded annually since fiscal year 2014. See Figure 1. General Mills improved its NOPAT margin from 12% in FY 2014 to 15% in the trailing-twelve-months (TTM) even though invested capital turns fell from 0.8 to 0.6 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins are enough to offset falling invested capital turns and drive return on invested capital slightly up from 9.3% in FY 2014 to 9.5% in the TTM. GIS Revenue & NOPAT 2014-TTM Additionally, the company’s Core Earnings, a proven superior measure that excludes unusual gains/losses, have grown 3% compounded annually from FY 2014 through the TTM. GIS Core Earnings 2014-TTM General Mills has adjusted its brand portfolio over the years through acquisitions and divestitures. With top brands including Cheerios, Nature Valley, Pillsbury, Totino’s, Progresso, and many more, the company is now well-positioned within multiple markets that are expected to experience strong (for consumer foods markets) growth in the coming years. For instance: General Mills should benefit from the growth in these markets, given its leading position in each market. For instance: Despite a challenging environment with retailer inventory headwinds and a slowdown in snacking, the company is still taking market share and increasing its retail pound volume (total volume of product sold in pounds) in key markets. Specifically, General Mills noted in its fiscal 3Q25 earnings release, it: General Mills has maintained consistently high margins in an increasingly competitive industry. General Mills’ average NOPAT margin is 13.8%, 14.9% and 15.1% over the past 10 years, five years, and TTM, respectively. Per Figure 3, General Mills generates the third highest NOPAT margin amongst its main competitors, which include, The Hershey Company (HSY), The Kraft Heinz Co (KHC), Mondelez International (MDLZ), Nestle (NSRGY), Unilever (UL), Kellanova (K), and Conagra Brands (CAG). GIS NOPAT vs Peers Since FY 2019, General Mills has paid $8.5 billion (27% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.49/share in fiscal 1Q19 to $0.60/share in fiscal 3Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 4.2% yield. General Mills has paid dividends every year for the past 126 years, including its predecessor company. I see such stability as a welcome reprieve amongst the volatility in the market today. General Mills also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From FY 2019 through fiscal 3Q25, the company repurchased $5.5 billion (17% of market cap) of shares. In June 2022, the Board of Directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares, with no specified expiration date. As of fiscal 3Q25, the company has 42.1 million shares available to repurchase under the existing authorization. Should the company repurchase shares at its TTM (ending fiscal 3Q25) rate, it would repurchase $1.3 billion of shares over the next twelve months, which equals 4.1% of the current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 8.3%. I take comfort in knowing General Mills will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchases based on its large free cash flow (FCF) generation. From fiscal 2019 through the TTM, General Mills generated $18.3 billion in FCF, which equals 38% of the company’s enterprise value. GIS Free Cash Flow 2019-3Q25 General Mills’ $18.3 billion FCF since FY 2019 is more than enough to cover its $14.0 in dividend payments ($8.5 billion) and share repurchases ($5.5 billion). Unlike many other riskier stocks, General Mills’ repurchases have meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 602 million in FY 2019 to 548 million in the TTM. See Figure 5. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of misallocating it to ill-advised acquisitions or large executive bonuses. GIS Shares Outstanding 2019-TTM Often one of the biggest threats to any consumer brand is the entrance of private labels that aim to take share with a cheaper alternative. This competition threatens margins across brand name products, as the brand owners must spend more heavily on marketing and promotion and/or lower prices to remain competitive with the private label brands. However, despite this ongoing threat, General Mills has proven that it has built sustainable brands that consumers gravitate towards. Apart from gaining market share, as noted earlier, General Mills has also consistently maintained and increased its high margin over the years. See Figure 6. GIS Quarterly NOPAT margin 1Q12-3Q25 In FY 2024, Walmart and its affiliates accounted for 22% of the company’s consolidated net sales, which means nearly a quarter of the company’s total sales are dependent on a good relationship with Walmart. While there are no indications of any issues, such concentration remains a risk should the relationship between Walmart and General Mills deteriorate in any way. At its current price of $58/share, GIS has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.9, which means the market expects the company’s profits to permanently fall 10% from current levels. For context, General Mills has grown NOPAT by 3% compounded annually over the last 10 years and 4% compounded annually over the last 20 years. Below, I use my firm’s reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for GIS. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock is worth $58/share today – nearly equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, General Mills’ NOPAT falls 1% compounded annually from fiscal 2025 – 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. If I instead assume: Then the stock is worth $70/share today – a 21% upside to the current price. In this scenario, General Mills’ NOPAT would grow just 1% compounded annually from FY 2025 to FY 2034. Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. Furthermore, I think companies with long track records of profit growth deserve premium stock valuations, especially in a market filled with so many underperforming companies. GIS DCF Implied NOPAT

Title: Pokemon TCG Hands-On: Is The Destined Rivals Expansion Worth It?

The newest TCG expansion is nearly here, but should players buy it? By Laura Gray With only a few weeks left to go before the release date of the Pokemon TCG Destined Rivals expansion, players are likely wondering if they should be waiting in line at local card shops or box stores on launch day. This new Scarlet and Violet set does have plenty to offer players, but there are a few things to know before jumping in. The Destined Rivals expansion for the Pokemon TCG is the second English set to add Trainer cards to the modern meta. These cards, which were seen in much older sets back in the 2000s, include things like Misty’s Psyduck, Brock’s Onix, Team Rocket’s Meowth, and so many more. Modern releases have reimagined some of the Trainer cards from previous generations, while also adding new options from favorite characters like Arven and Marnie. These cards alone may be the reason fans choose to grab up Destined Rivals ETBs on launch, but there are a few things to know about the set after The Pokemon Company provided me an early look at the cards. Official reveal of Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex special illustration rare #DestinedRivals pic.twitter.com/P9IYYEqexT The Pokemon TCG Destined Rivals list contains 244 different cards. This is one of the biggest Scarlet and Violet expansions to date, challenging Evolve Skies from Sword and Shield. A massive card list has pros and cons, but most notably makes pull rates unstable for the set. We opened 55 packs with our preview, and only pulled four cards total that were of a Gold Star rarity or better. These are some of the most challenging odds that have appeared so far in the Scarlet & Violet era, surpassing Prismatic Evolutions in difficulty. This is surprising, as there aren’t any “typical” chase cards like Charizard in this expansion. Pokemon TCG sets have struggled with repeat syndrome in recent years. Due to collector hype, expansions typically spotlight a handful of favorite, highly desirable species over others. This includes Pikachu, Charizard, Eevee, all Eeveelutions, and Legendaries in particular. However, the Trainer’s element of the newer expansions has forced the TCG to print some particularly interesting cards. Cynthia’s Garchomp was an expected addition, but Cynthia’s Roserade is an elegant and surprising card that may not normally have gotten attention without this set. Additionally, Ethan’s Sudowoodo takes the stage, putting a spotlight on a regularly forgotten fighting type. Destined Rivals is unusually diverse as a card list thanks to the trainers that are featured in the lineup, and this makes it particularly fun for those who play the game competitively or casually with friends. Like with Prismatic Evolutions and Journey Together, Destined Rivals has already seen issues with stock availability. The Pokemon TCG has been facing shortages on the same level as during 2020 and 2021 with recent sets, and pre-orders for Destined Rivals have already sold out on The Pokemon Center website. This could make obtaining this set difficult for fans, and the low pull rates from the high number of cards on the list will make it even more difficult for those looking to obtain rare cards like Special Illustrations or Golden full arts. Players looking to find these cards could need to purchase multiple booster boxes, making it an investment very similar to the Evolving Skies struggle of the Galar era. Those looking to purchase this set will likely have to go up against resellers at big box stores on launch day, with the high possibility that no sets will be available to those who aren’t at the stores as they open. Additionally, reselling will be an issue in the weeks after launch, with sets bought at MSRP being resold for well above the original price. This can make finding packs difficult, especially for younger players. Yes, despite the setbacks, Destined Rivals is worth investing in. The Trainer’s cards of this set are particularly exciting, even if you don’t pull the rarest options in the box. The Team Rocket’s cards include beautiful standard arts of the Kantonian Legendary Birds, Ho-oh, and Mewtwo, among many others. Cynthia’s and Arven’s cards are both powerful and offer unique strategies for those who might want to make a themed deck, and Marnie’s cards bring a fresh round of powerful dark types to the meta. While this might not be the best set for those looking to collect cards, those wanting to play will have a plethora of options to enhance decks and energize strategies. Pokemon TCG fans won’t want to miss out on having these unique cards in their collections, as it could be quite some time before this style of card returns to expansions in the future.

ByAdam Sarhan ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 06: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... More morning trading on August 06, 2024 in New York City. Stocks opened up slightly up in the three major indexes a day after the Dow Jones and the S & P 500 had their worst day of trading since 2022, amid a global market sell-off centered around fears of a U.S. recession. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Stocks soared on Monday after a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war. That was the big trade elephant in the room. The fact that the U.S. and China are speaking and are on good terms is a good sign and helps remove fear of an all out trade war. That big fear that the tariffs would crush the global economy was the primary catalyst that sent stocks lower in February and March. Trump eased the tariffs in April and stocks soared. Now we are getting closer to trade deals which is very encouraging. In other news, inflation came in weaker than expected which is a very good sign. On Monday, the White House announced a 90-day suspension on new tariffs targeting Chinese imports. This was a step in the “right” direction and helped the market rally nicely. This de-escalation will not only help the U.S. and China it will also help the U.S. strike deals with other trading partners. The pause offers both parties time to work toward a more durable resolution — which is a welcomed sign. I like to focus on how the market reacts to the news. For now, the reaction is very positive. The market soared on the news and was up just about every day this week. The S&P 500 rallied, erasing its year-to-date losses and turned positive on the year. The same is true for the Nasdaq 100. Additionally, and equally impressive, both indices are now “only” 4% (or thereabouts) below their record highs. That’s very impressive considering they were both down over 20% five to six weeks ago. If we keep making progress like this, we can easily hit new highs very soon. In other bullish news, inflation continued to fall which gives the Fed room to cut rates, if it wants to. This added to the rally. The latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation easing for the second straight month. Headline inflation rose at a 2.4% annualized rate in March — lower than February and below economists’ expectations. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also softened to its lowest level in over three years. Remember, the Fed has dual mandate: keep unemployment low and keep inflation near 2%. So far, it can check both boxes. If the data continues to improve, the Fed can stop raising rates and possible cut rates later this year. For markets, the prospect of a less aggressive Fed added another boost to risk appetite and stocks. In the middle of the week, attention turned to Washington, where lawmakers prepared for a big vote on President Donald Trump’s proposed tax and spending package. The bill, which includes cuts for both individuals and corporations, has become a focal point for investors. The bulls want to see the bill pass because tax relief could stimulate corporate profits and consumer spending — two big wins for stocks. However, internal divisions remain, and some lawmakers cautioned that a vote could be delayed. Despite the uncertainty, the market remained mostly optimistic that some version of the package would eventually pass. It was also a big week for many companies. Walmart reported earnings and the company said tariffs are not really that big of a deal right now. The CEO also said that he’s ready to raise prices, if needed in the future. Here’s a link to the earnings transcript. Shares of Novo Nordisk dropped sharply after CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen announced his resignation, Yahoo! Finance reported. The company has faced rising pressure in the competitive obesity drug market, particularly from U.S. rival Eli Lilly. Novo has plunged over 55% since its 52-week high. Charter Communications surged following news of a planned merger with its cable rival, Cox Communications. The deal would create the nation’s second-largest cable operator as the industry adapts to the shift toward streaming. Here’s an article from CNBC that explained the merger in more detail. Shares of UnitedHealth fell hard after reporting earnings a few weeks ago. Then shares fell hard again when news spread that the Department of Justice was investigating the company. Here’s a CNBC article that explains the story in more detail. Applied Materials rallied after reporting earnings which was encouraging news for tech stocks. Semiconductors have been under pressure most of this year but that could be changing. Reuters reported the news in more detail here. Take-Two disappointed investors with a weaker full-year outlook and news that the next Grand Theft Auto would be delayed. Despite topping revenue estimates, the stock dropped after cutting guidance. The WSJ reported it in more detail here. Constellation Brands rallied after Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had more than doubled its stake in the beverage giant, signaling long-term confidence in the company. Yahoo! Finance reported the news here. Shares of Meta fell on Thursday after the tech giant announced its AI model would be delayed. Reuters reported the story here. Dicks Sporting Goods announced it will acquired Foot Locker. Investor’s Business Daily reported the news here. The cooler than expected inflation data boosted sentiment, but not all economic signals were positive. April’s retail sales slowed, raising concerns about consumer momentum. On Friday, consumer sentiment came out at 50.8, which was the second lowest on record. While the U.S.-China tariff pause was the global headline, it’s not a permanent fix. Chinese officials indicated that 90 days may not be enough to bridge key disagreements, and analysts expect tariffs to remain in place through at least the end of 2025. Despite the rally, analysts caution that volatility could return. In the short-term we are very overbought and due to pullback. Strategists at Societe Generale noted that while “risk-on” sentiment may carry forward, further gains may require clearer policy outcomes and stronger fundamentals. Wall Street’s rally this week marks a sharp reversal from weakness we saw earlier this year. The S&P 500’s rebound is impressive and underscores how sensitive markets remain to macro and geopolitical developments. Looking ahead, the tug-of-war between economic data, fiscal policy, and international dynamics will continue to shape investor sentiment. For now, optimism has returned and that’s a good thing. Remember, in the short-term the market is very overbought and due to pullback. Short-term pullbacks aside, if we break out to new highs, we can easily have another bigly leg up from here.

Title: Novo Nordisk's CEO is out after the Ozempic maker's stock dropped 50% in a year
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-ceo-resigns-stock-ozempic-wegovy-1851780983
Time Published: 2025-05-16T12:59:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen will step down after eight years at the helm of the Danish pharmaceutical giant responsible for the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, the company said Friday. The move comes after Novo Nordisk’s share price fell 50% over the last 12 months, and amid growing pressure from the powerful Novo Nordisk Foundation, which controls the company’s voting majority. Jørgensen, who joined Novo in 1991 and became CEO in 2017, will stay on for a transition period, the company said. A search for his successor is underway. “Novo Nordisk’s strategy remains unchanged, and the Board is confident in the company’s current business plans and its ability to execute on the plans,” Helge Lund, the Novo’s board chair, said in a statement. “Serving as Novo Nordisk’s CEO for the past eight years has been a privilege and an experience that I will always cherish,” Jørgensen said. Novo Nordisk stock was down about 3% in Friday morning trading after the announcement. During his tenure, Novo Nordisk became Europe’s most valuable company — at one point surpassing LVMH — thanks to skyrocketing sales of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic (for type 2 diabetes) and Wegovy (for weight loss). Both belong to the GLP-1 class of drugs, which regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. For a stretch, the growth was nothing short of eye-popping. Since its 2017 debut, Ozempic alone grew into a $13 billion-a-year drug, while Wegovy, which was approved in 2021, became a $4.5 billion blockbuster in just two years. Together, Novo’s GLP-1 therapies helped drive one of the fastest commercial expansions in pharmaceutical history, transforming the company from a niche diabetes firm into a global superpower. Demand was so intense that Novo was forced to pause its advertising in 2023 because of supply shortages. At the height of the craze, Jørgensen told Bloomberg that he was fielding calls from food company CEOs, so scared were they by the weight-reducing possibility of the new drugs. Hollywood gossip and everyday cocktail party chatter became dominated by speculation about who’s on Ozempic and who’s trying to track down their own supply. Novo’s oral version, Rybelsus, became another effective addition to its portfolio, while legacy insulin brands like NovoLog and Tresiba helped the company maintain its dominance in diabetes care. But Novo Nordisk’s fortunes have notably shifted over the past year. Shares fell about 50% over the last year amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY), underwhelming trial results for next-gen therapy CagriSema, and growing investor skepticism about just how big the GLP-1 market can get. Wall Street’s initial burst of enthusiasm regarding weight-loss drugs has cooled off considerably. Novo’s Q1 report, which was released on May 7 and lowered growth expectations on “lower-than-planned penetration of branded GLP-1 treatments in the US,” failed to reverse the trend. Likewise, Friday’s announcement seems only to have further spooked markets. Novo shares fell around 5% in Copenhagen trading, with its U.S.-listed shares also on the decline. Eli Lilly stock, for its part, rose 1.3%. The Novo Nordisk Foundation also signaled a desire for more control going forward. Foundation chair and former CEO Lars Rebien Sørensen will begin attending board meetings immediately, with plans for formal election in 2026.

Title: Munster minor hurling final: Cork v Waterford throw-in, teams and where to watch

They made hard work of it, but Cork are Munster minor hurling champions after eventually overcoming a determined Waterford side with just two points to spare in a sun-drenched FBD Semple Stadium on Friday evening. Cork’s pace and ability to break through the lines caused Waterford all sorts of problems from the get-go with Fergal McCormack’s side taking an almost double-score lead – 0-11 to 0-6 – into the half-time break, before a late second half spirited comeback from Waterford almost brought the game to extra time. With Cork leading by a comfortable-looking five-point lead heading into time added on, the John Doyle Cup looked certain to be heading to Leeside for the first time in four years, but two late Waterford goals almost turned the result on its head. One for the future, it was Waterford’s Cormac Spain who scored 2-10 of his side’s return of 2-15 to keep the pressure on the eventual winners. It was the Leesiders who got off to a flying start and were 0-04 to 0-01 up after six minutes. However, both sides were level four minutes later after scores from Spain – a point from play and a free – and a superb Dylan Murphy score from out wide swung the momentum in Waterford’s favour. Cork had other ideas, however, and six points without response, with the Rebels’ scores coming from Cormac Deane, Craig O’Sullivan (2), Sean Coughlan, and Tom Walsh (2), putting six between the sides by the 23rd minute, quickly putting a halt to the Déise’s momentum. McCormack’s young guns deservedly took a five-point lead into the break. With little or no breeze backing either side in the opening half, it was going to take a mammoth improvement in performance for Waterford to turn the game around in the final half-hour. Cork quickly made that uphill task into a mountainous challenge with the boys in red quickly opening up a seven-point lead – 0-14 to 0-07 early in the second half. A determined Waterford side narrowed the deficit to four with nine minutes to go, giving James O’Connor’s side a real sense of belief. Cork entered the seven minutes added on with five points to spare, but with five of the seven minutes up, it was somehow a one-point game thanks to two late Cormac Spain goals, either side a Seán Ring goal. The Rebels held out for the win with a Craig O’Sullivan free – the last puck of the game – easing Cork nerves. Cork: Tom C Walsh; Darragh Heavin, Denis Fitzgerald, Cian Lawton; Michael T Brosnan, Bobby Carroll (capt.), Colm Garde; Tom A Walsh (0-03), Jack Counihan; Ruairc Donovan (0-02), Cormac Deane (0-02), Craig O’Sullivan (0-08, three frees); Seán Coughlan (0-01), Callum Coffey, Eoghan O’Shea (0-02) Subs: Seán Ring (1-00) for Coffey (41 minutes, injured), Ryan Dineen (0-02) for Counihan (half time), Charlie Hanratty for O’Shea (50), Darragh Winters for Coughlan (63) Waterford: James Comerford (capt.); Conor Lynch, Darragh Murphy, Darragh Keane; Bradley Penkert, Hugo Quann (0-01), Conor Power; Gearóid O’Shea, Eoin Burke; Caolinn Reville, Jack Power, Dylan Murphy (0-02); Cormac Spain (2-10, six frees, one ’65, 1-0 free), Shane Power (0-01), Jamie Shanahan Subs: Josh Zeljkovic (0-01) for Burke (half time), Tommy Kennedy for Conor Power (37 minutes), Pierce Quann for Reville (55) Referee: Ciaran O’Donovan (Tipperary) Get an in-depth look at the weekend's action and the best analysis of upcoming fixtures in our weekly newsletter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Billionaire investor David Tepper apparently no longer thinks it's time to buy "everything" in China. Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa L.P. slashed its stakes in several Chinese companies in recent months, according to the firm's latest 13-F filing. The fund slashed its position in Baidu (BIDU) nearly in half and its stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA), JD.com (JD), Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD), and Chinese real estate platform KE Holdings (BEKE) by 19% to 26% since its last filing in February. It also lowered its stake in the iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) and KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) by about 16% and 13%, respectively. In an interview with CNBC last September, the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers said the government stimulus package China was putting into its economy at the time made it an attractive place for investors. Tepper said he would want to buy "everything" in the country, as the stimulus would impact assets from stocks to ETFs and bonds. The latest filing also revealed that Appaloosa opened a 130,000-share position in Broadcom (AVGO) in the last three months, and that it sold the last of its stakes in FedEx (FDX) and Intel (INTC). The firm also boosted its shares of Meta Platforms (META), and cut its ownership of Lyft (LYFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Title: What’s Behind The 400% Rise In META Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/14: In this photo illustration, the Meta Platforms logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) has experienced a significant surge of nearly 30% in the past month, driven by investor optimism regarding a potential trade agreement with the UK and a 90-day rollback of recent tariffs between the U.S. and China. This performance notably outstrips the broader Nasdaq index, which has risen by 17%. However, it’s important to note that the stock has also faced its share of negative news. The Wall Street Journal recently reported a delay in the rollout of a flagship AI model, citing difficulties in enhancing the capabilities of its "Behemoth" large language model. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? Looking at a longer timeframe, META's outperformance is even more significant, delivering a stellar 437% return since early 2023—climbing from approximately $120 to around $645—compared to the Nasdaq's 83% increase over the same period. This substantial growth can be attributed to: Let’s delve deeper into these factors. While META stock has performed remarkably well, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Meta Platforms operates the world's most popular social network, enabling people to connect with friends and family. The company's primary revenue source is advertising, which it delivers to advertisers by targeting specific demographics based on user-provided information across its platforms. Meta Platforms has experienced a significant 46% revenue increase, rising from $117 billion in 2022 to $170 billion over the last twelve months. This growth can be attributed to both an increase in ad impressions and a higher average price per advertisement. Furthermore, the daily active people (DAP) across Meta's family of apps have grown by 16%, from 2.95 billion in 2022 to 3.43 billion currently. A substantial portion of the company's revenue is generated from ad sales on its key platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. Meta is currently benefiting from its strategic investment in artificial intelligence, which allows for more effective ad targeting. Looking ahead, the company intends to leverage AI to generate more content. Over the past three years, Meta Platforms has demonstrated strong financial performance. Its net income margin has nearly doubled, increasing from 19.9% in 2022 to 39.2% currently. This improvement is attributable to continued user growth, optimized AI infrastructure, effective ad targeting, and strategic cost reductions, including workforce adjustments. This operational success is reflected in a substantial 188% increase in Meta's net income, which rose from $23 billion to $67 billion over this period. Additionally, Meta's aggressive share repurchase program, totaling $90 billion, has reduced its outstanding shares by 4%. The combined effect of rising revenues, expanding profit margins and significantly higher net income, and fewer shares outstanding has driven a 198% surge in the company's bottom line, from $8.59 per share in 2022 to $25.64 now. The recent positive performance of Meta Platforms stock reflects investor confidence in the company's revenue-generating potential. The growth in both ad impressions and the average price per ad suggests strong future sales. Furthermore, Meta's strategic investment in AI is expected to enhance advertising revenues through better user engagement and targeting. This positive sentiment, driven by the company's improved financial performance—including strong sales growth and increased profitability—is demonstrated by the significant increase in Meta's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which has risen from 14x in 2022 to the current 25x. This financial change unfolded against a backdrop of a challenging market environment, specifically the inflation shock of 2022 that caused a significant stock market correction. During this downturn, META stock experienced a substantial 77% decline, falling from its September 2021 peak of $382 to a low of $89 by November 2022—a sharper drop than the S&P 500’s 25.4% fall. Meta's subsequent recovery was gradual, with the stock eventually returning to its pre-crisis peak by January 2024, illustrating both the market's severity and the company's inherent ability to bounce back. With a current trading price around $645, Meta Platforms' price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 25, based on its trailing adjusted EPS of $25.64. This is a notable increase from its three-year average P/E of roughly 16x. Despite this seemingly high multiple, the premium appears justified by the company's considerable opportunities in the fast-growing AI space. These AI developments are expected to drive stronger sales growth through more effective ad targeting and content creation, building upon the company's 12% average sales growth over the past three years with slightly higher projected rates. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation at $702 per share, suggesting a potential upside of approximately 10% from current levels. For long-term investors, META stock may signify an opportunity, considering the company’s strong fundamentals and positioning in the AI market. However, those apprehensive about near-term volatility should contemplate suitable strategies, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio strategy, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the previous four-year span. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Earnings per share rose two per cent to 73.3p, ahead of previous guidance. National Grid announced a total dividend of 46.72p for its shareholders, which include major institutional investors such as Blackrock and Vanguard. “At a time of international economic uncertainty, National Grid continues to provide stable and predictable growth through our resilient business model,” outgoing chief executive John Pettigrew said in a statement. “We remain focused on delivering secure, affordable and clean energy to our customers and communities, and providing long-term value and returns for our shareholders.” Shares have risen around 4.6 per cent this year to date. National Grid investment hits annual record The company is in the midst of an unprecedented £60bn investment drive over the next five years as the UK edges towards a 2030 deadline for decarbonising the grid. National Grid on Thursday said capital investment had increased 20 per cent to a record £9.8bn over the last year. Some £23bn investment is expected in electricity transmission in the UK, where it is working on 17 critical renewable energy projects. The company has earmarked tens of billions of pounds in spending over the coming years to upgrade the UK’s grid system. It recently raised £7bn via a share placing from investors to fund the growth and strengthen its balance sheet. Supply chain and delivery mechanisms have already been secured for more than two thirds of its £60bn proposals, it added. It was annnounced in May that the firm’s long-serving boss John Pettigrew will be replaced by Zoë Yujnovich, a former director at Shell, later this year.

Title: Preserving Your Wealth In Volatile Markets With Better Financial Planning

ByLetitia Berbaum ByLetitia Berbaum, Forbes Councils Member. Letitia Berbaum is the founder of Blue Sands Wealth. She specializes in wealth planning, legacy strategies, and business exits. Shelby Cullom Davis is credited with saying: “You make most of your money in a bear market. You just don’t realize it at the time.” When markets drop, it’s natural to want to sell or pause your investments. But in reality, market downturns are often a good time to position your wealth for the future, as long as you’re prepared. While others panic and react to market fluctuations, you can consider strategies that may help your investments, such as buying at a discount and leveraging tax strategies that can potentially help preserve and even grow your wealth. Without a solid strategy in place, most people can miss these opportunities. Either they aren’t effectively diversified, so they don’t have the ability to act, or fear keeps them sidelined. But here’s the key: Volatile markets don’t have to mean the sky is falling. In other words, it’s important to note that volatile markets do not necessarily mean a severe outcome. Instead, they can be opportunities if you’ve done the proper financial planning beforehand. At a minimum, it’s key to not let fear push you out of properly planned long-term investments. Why? History shows us that time in the market trumps trying to time the market. According to BlackRock and Bloomberg data, an investor who stayed invested in stocks over a 20-year period through the end of 2024 would have ended up with approximately 58% more than one who missed the five best-performing days. While the “buy and hold” message seems ubiquitous, recent research highlights a troubling trend. Retail investors have been selling more lately, not less, in response to volatility. Dalbar, an investor research firm, found that the average equity investor earned just 16.54% in 2024, compared to the S&P 500’s 25.05% return. The reason for the shortfall? These individuals sold during downturns and missed the rebounds. Understanding that all investing involves risk including the loss of principal typical investors have some level of diversification outside of equities. Coupled with fees, expenses and taxes an individual’s results will differ from both the average and the S&P 500. BlackRock’s point remains, staying the course has provided more consistency A solid long-term plan is essential for navigating the ups and downs of the market. It helps steady your nerves when volatility hits. Instead of fearing market swings, you’ll see them as chances to potentially grow your wealth while managing risk. What if you’re not yet there? While it’s best to have your plan in place before volatility strikes, there’s no better time than now to start. Yes, it does take time, and an automated, quick plan won’t do the job. You need real investment planning to help you find strategies to preserve and build sustainable wealth. Wealth preservation isn’t just about defense. Tax strategies can have an even bigger impact, making them a key part of your plan. And in down markets, some tax moves become even more effective. For example, Roth conversions can be a good option when markets are down, allowing you to change tax-deferred assets into a future tax-free income source at a lower cost. Another down-market strategy is tax-loss harvesting. By selling a losing stock position, you can offset gains and reduce your tax bill. To make it a smart move, replace the position with a similar, but not identical, asset. This way, you realize the tax savings while staying positioned to benefit when the market recovers. Trusts, life insurance and annuities can be other avenues to help you reduce tax liabilities and protect your assets. Keep in mind none of these strategies should be considered legal or tax advice to be acted upon without the advice of your attorney or tax professional. While diversification doesn’t eliminate losses, it helps reduce the risk of significant declines by spreading investments across different asset classes. To help protect against inflation, consider making additional small shifts toward more defensive assets. Increasing exposure to high-quality bonds or dividend-paying stocks can increase stability. Also, you can explore additional diversification through inflation-hedging assets such as real estate, gold or Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) to help protect your portfolio during economic uncertainty. In 2020, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, billionaire investor Ray Dalio famously quipped, “Cash is trash.” However, in today’s more normalized environment, you might want to avoid that thinking. In addition to earning a yield, building a cash allocation into your plan allows you to take advantage of low stock price per share that has come down due to overall market volatility or economic concerns not due to the companies’ fundamentals. For example, a company with strong P/E Price to Earnings ratios could indicate the that the price of that stock could be undervalued compared to its peers thus creating an opportunity to buy in at a lower price per share regardless of the recent market volatility. At the same time, cash is a defensive play, helping make your portfolio more resilient. When markets are volatile, emotions can cloud judgment. An experienced advisor should proactively check in with you during these times. They should be reviewing your risk tolerance with you, as well. Is financial stress keeping you up at night? An advisor can help you rebalance your portfolio or adjust strategies so you’re more comfortable. Most importantly, your advisor should help you avoid expensive, panic-driven mistakes you may later regret. Market downturns are a natural part of the investment cycle—and they shouldn’t be feared. While they can be unsettling, they offer rare opportunities to make strategic adjustments and position yourself for potential future success. When you’re prepared, the best opportunities often arrive during the toughest times. The information provided here is not investment, tax, legal or financial advice.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider.

Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies.

Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Title: Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/16/googles-1-trillion-lawsuit/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 14: Neal Mohan, CEO, YouTube attends YouTube Brandcast 2025 at David Geffen ... More Hall on May 14, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for YouTube) Alphabet has been running this ad recently: There’s Only One YouTube. Talk about bad timing. It seems Alphabet’s marketing department might not be in contact with legal, or even higher management. Consider that Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently testified in a lawsuit, attempting to prevent Alphabet’s breakup! Their argument centers on the idea that YouTube, Google Search, Google Docs, Waymo self-driving cars, and all other entities under the Alphabet umbrella have significant competition. See, Break up Google and Declare Communism. Now, Google’s overall value can be broken down into several key areas: its core search business, advertising on YouTube, network property revenues, Google Cloud services, and a collection of other businesses. Here’s the full view. Alphabet (GOOG) Valuation Breakdown What’s the potential impact of a breakup? Could the sum of its parts be worth significantly less than the current company, maybe even half? This explains why Google’s management is rightly worried. What would happen to all the shared intelligence and analytics expenses that boost ad sales and marketing, along with management costs? These could easily double, leaving you with half the value. The reason? Reduced size and market power. Remember when Google’s stock plummeted 10% in a day after an Apple executive hinted that Google Search was losing share? Well, a smaller, broken-up Google would definitely be in a weaker position to meet Apple’s potential price demands. Now, we take risk minimization to heart in our High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. It gets even worse. A smaller revenue base means less ability to invest in crucial new technologies and cover their fixed costs. Not a very welcome thought at a time when peers OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft are doubling down on AI development. This is an unprecedented moment, and Alphabet’s stock could plummet by 50% or even more. See Buy or Sell Google Stock. No matter what they do, that "There’s only one YouTube" ad will come back to haunt them. Timing is everything. That said, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: High-rise condo project in Las Vegas being considered by Summerlin developer
URL: https://www.reviewjournal.com/post/3373079
Time Published: 2025-05-15T22:51:45Z
Full Content:
Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly said he’s contemplating a high-rise project near the Downtown Summerlin open-air mall. Summerlin’s developer has filled out tracts of land across from its big outdoor mall in Las Vegas, building apartments, a ballpark and a new retail center with a Whole Foods Market that opened Thursday. It could also put up high-rise housing. Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly said in a recent interview that he’s contemplating a high-rise condo project on land just east of the Downtown Summerlin open-air mall off Sahara Avenue and the 215 Beltway. “I think that’s a great use right now,” he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. O’Reilly pointed to condo sales in The Summit Club, a wealthy enclave in Summerlin with homeowners such as movie star Mark Wahlberg. He said land near the mall could have a mix of offices, retail, and for-sale and rental housing, but he also noted that plans for that area have evolved over the years. He said the company would have penciled a lot more office space for the site a decade ago than it would today, after the pandemic slashed demand for offices around the country amid widespread work-from-home arrangements. Hedge-fund stock deal O’Reilly spoke with the Review-Journal after New York hedge-fund boss Bill Ackman reached a deal to boost his ownership stake in the developer and widen its scope of operations. As announced May 5, Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management acquired 9 million newly issued shares in Texas-based Hughes Holdings for $100 apiece, or $900 million total. Ackman, the company’s former chairman, was also named executive chairman, and his investment firm’s ownership stake in the developer climbed to 46.9 percent from 37.6 percent as of early this year. Ackman had sought to acquire 10 million new shares in Hughes Holdings for $90 apiece — also $900 million total — and take the helm as chairman and chief executive. Instead, his firm bought less stock at a higher price-per-share, and O’Reilly kept the CEO’s seat. The deal will enable the developer to become a diversified holding company by acquiring controlling stakes in operating companies — a shift proposed by Ackman — while still growing its core real estate business, according to a news release. Hughes Holdings has projects and properties, including master-planned communities such as Summerlin, in Texas, Arizona, Hawaii, Maryland and Nevada. Spanning 22,500 acres along the Las Vegas Valley’s western rim, Summerlin boasts 130,000 residents and some of the highest home prices in Southern Nevada, as well as parks, trails and community centers. The developer’s namesake Howard Hughes, the famed aviator, business tycoon and recluse, acquired the land mass in the 1950s. Hughes Holdings sells land in Summerlin to homebuilders and has developed hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects in the heart of Las Vegas’ biggest master-planned community. $900M ‘put to work’ O’Reilly said the transaction with Pershing Square will not impact Summerlin’s development or the company’s broader real estate business, other than improving its credit and cost of capital. He also indicated that it would use the investment from Ackman’s firm to buy stakes in outside companies. “It’s that $900 million that’s going to be put to work to do that,” O’Reilly said. He said the task of finding, valuing and buying stakes in other companies will be largely handled by Pershing Square and Hughes Holdings’ new chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, who holds the same role at Ackman’s firm. Plus, O’Reilly doesn’t expect to invest in real estate-related businesses, noting such companies typically spend a lot of money upfront and wait a while for returns to roll in. Pershing Square’s investment portfolio has included such companies as payroll processor ADP, streaming giant Netflix and ride-hailing firm Uber. “I think it would be unlikely to actually see us invest in a real estate business,” O’Reilly said. Contact Eli Segall at esegall@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0342. With the federal government controlling 80 percent of the state, Gov. Joe Lombardo said Southern Nevada will run out of land to develop on by 2032 if more parcels aren’t released. Realtors with Las Vegas Realtors volunteered to help put finishing touches on a home repair by Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada. Fewer than 20 percent of Nevada residents now believe the state is an affordable place to live, and many Nevadans have considered leaving as a result of the housing crisis, a survey finds. The Las Vegas Planning Commission approved plans for the new complex that would be built in the central Las Vegas Valley near downtown and the Strip. New data shows a glut of new multifamily units has hit the market and vacancy rates have held steady. The Las Vegas Planning Commission voted against recommending a resort and housing project proposed for the Historic Westside during a lengthy meeting. Rental rates are varying across the entire Las Vegas Valley, according to a new report from Zumper. Here’s why. Gov. Joe Lombardo and U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei have taken direct aim at the Bureau of Land Management’s vast control of the Las Vegas Valley regarding the housing crisis. A luxury real estate agent says many of his clients are moving to the Las Vegas Valley from California because they are looking for a different lifestyle. A portion of the project site was previously owned by two entertainers synonymous with America’s casino capital.

Title: It looks like Meta just hit a big AI roadblock

Time Published: 2025-05-15T21:40:00Z
Full Content:
Meta (META) reportedly has delayed the release of its latest artificial intelligence model, known internally as “Behemoth,” raising concerns among employees about the effectiveness and direction of the company’s massive AI investments. Engineers have struggled to improve the large-language model’s performance compared to earlier versions in the Llama model family, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reports. This has prompted internal debate about whether the upgrade is substantial enough to merit public release, sources told the Journal. Shares in Meta were down more than 2% by Thursday’s close. Initially set for an April debut during Meta’s first AI developer conference, Behemoth’s launch was pushed to June and potentially has been postponed until at least the fall. When Meta released two smaller Llama models in April, the company was praised for the speed with which it has caught up with rivals when it comes to developing its own generative AI tools. The company now faces increasing pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress with Behemoth and signal to Wall Street it can follow through with a return-on-investment. Meta has spent billions on AI development, with plans for up to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year. Its stock price to earnings ratio is 25.05, as of May 15, meaning investors are paying $25.05 for every $1 of earnings. Though Meta has publicly claimed Behemoth outperforms competing models such as OpenAI, Google (GOOGL), and Anthropic in some benchmarks, internal sources told the Journal that the model is facing significant training challenges, and its real-world performance may not live up to the company’s public claims. Meta’s AI journey began with its Fundamental AI Research Team, which developed the original Llama models in early 2023. However, 11 of the 14 authors of the initial Llama paper have since left the company, and newer versions are being built by a different team. Controversy also arose in April when it was revealed that the model Meta submitted to a widely used AI chatbot leaderboard was not the same version released to the public. Meta later admitted it had optimized the submitted model specifically for the benchmark. Meta is not alone in facing delays, however. OpenAI’s next major model, GPT-5, has also been postponed, with the company instead rolling out an intermediate version called GPT-4.5. Anthropic has likewise delayed the release of Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger and more powerful AI model, though it said the release is imminent.

Title: AI, Quantum Stocks Are Some of the Most Shorted on Wall Street

AI stocks are the hottest trades on Wall Street again. They're also among traders' favorite stocks to bet against. Wall Street regained its risk appetite this week thanks to easing U.S.-China tensions, soft inflation data, and a slew of deal announcements out of President Trump's Middle East tour. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), sometimes called “the fear index,” dropped below 20 for the first time since March on Monday and has held steady since then. AI stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have been among the biggest beneficiaries of investors' subsiding fear. But with stock gains comes speculation that the rally won't last, and thus more interest from active traders, like hedge funds, looking for opportunities to profit from pullbacks. Among the stocks least loved by active traders is SoundHound AI (SOUN). Traders have sold short about $1.2 billion of the Nvidia-backed company’s stock, compared with just $340 million of long positions, according to data from market research firm S3 Partners. Another notable name: Super Micro Computer (SMCI), shares of which have soared about 40% this week amid a blistering AI rally. The total value of Supermicro short positions exceeds long positions by more than half a billion dollars. In dollar terms, SoundHound and Supermicro skew short more than most stocks. But relative to their size, these two stocks have more bullish support than some other hot stocks. Traders have sold short five times as much Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock as they’ve bought long. Two more quantum computing stocks—IonQ (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS)—have short-to-long ratios exceeding 2:1. Other stocks in which short positions are about double long positions include Plug Power (PLUG), Trump Media & Technology (DJT), and GameStop (GME).

CoreWeave stock tumbled Wednesday following its first earnings report since going public, as the data center company’s growing capital expenditure raised concerns among investors. Shares in the Nvidia-backed (NVDA) company initially dropped more than 13% during after-hours trading, following the results before shares rebounded on Thursday morning. CoreWeave is a so-called ‘picks and shovels’ company of the AI revolution. It’s one of the largest holders of Nvidia’s graphics processing units and leases data center capacity to Big Tech companies. The firm’s executives said in a call following the report’s publication that it expects to spend between $20 billion and $23 billion in 2025. That tops the $18.3 billion projected by Wall Street analysts, according to Yahoo Finance, citing Bloomberg consensus estimates. Analysts downgraded their outlook for CoreWeave stock following the news. Gil Luria of DA Davidson downgraded the stock to an Underperform rating from Neutral on Thursday morning, citing the “level of capital intensity equity investors are unlikely to stomach.” Luria also pointed to CoreWeave’s soaring interest expenses for the decision. The company’s interest expenses rose 549% in the first quarter, totaling $264 million. That’s more than the $182 million projected by Wall Street, according to Yahoo Finance (APO), citing Bloomberg data. Operating expenses have been soaring too. While CoreWeave announced a 420% revenue increase from the same period last year, it also unveiled a 487% jump in operating costs, totaling more than $1 billion for the first quarter of the year. CoreWeave is not the first tech company to take an expensive gamble on AI-related infrastructure — and then be punished on Wall Street for it. Leading the pack is Microsoft (MSFT), which plans to allocate $80 billion in capital expenditures for data center development in the 2025 fiscal year, it announced in a January blog post. Analysts forecast that such spending could create a drag on margins for several years. Meanwhile, Amazon’s (AMZN) capital expenditures are expected to reach approximately $75 billion in 2025, up more than 50% from the previous year. Following that company call in February, its stock slipped more than 5% in after-hours trading. Alphabet (GOOGL) also plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, the majority of which to be directed to enhancing technical infrastructure for AI, it announced during a call with investors in February. Google’s stock fell more than 8% immediately after. Likewise, Meta (META) has set its AI capital expenditure budget at $60 billion to $65 billion for 2025—a significant jump from previous years.

This story was produced by The Margin in collaboration with The Nation.Please note this article contains mention of suicide, self-harm, and sexual violence. Near gale force winds stretched nimbostratus clouds that resembled alpine peaks turned sideways above the heavily industrialized zone known as the Tacoma Tideflats on a Saturday afternoon in mid-March. Concertina wire spiraled down the top of the chain-link fence marking the western edge of E. J Street. A nearby train engine billowed diesel exhaust, contaminating the wind. Its unmistakable stench stung the nostrils. Reflections of the compound buildings appeared in pools of rainwater and pulsed and blurred with each passing breeze. From the south, a big wind rose, slanting heavy raindrops against a group of some 40 protesters led by La Resistencia. They stood together with protest signs that folded and unfolded in the wind and rain. Inside soaked jackets, members and allies of the activist organization stood in solidarity against the Northwest ICE Processing Center, also known as the Northwest Detention Center, which is owned by The GEO Group and is contracted by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The facility houses all genders. The detention center imprisons people who are suspected of violating civil immigration laws. While immigrants detained in the facility are from countries across the globe, many are from Latin America, one of several regions that has felt the brunt of European colonization and American imperialism. The impacts of these forces have made life in the countries unlivable for many, forcing people to migrate. However, when they reach the borders of the countries, including the United States, which have contributed to or caused their displacement, they are met with hostility and immigration policies that turn their plight into profit. The GEO Group acquired Corrections Services Corporation and its detention facility in a heavily industrialized area, allegedly exposing immigrants to numerous sources of pollution. Over nearly 30 years, numerous test pits and groundwater monitoring wells, both immediately adjacent to and beneath the detention facility site, have revealed the presence of petroleum products, including diesel, gasoline, and heavy oil. Furthermore, the detention facility has a notorious reputation due to years of documented human rights abuses. Despite these man-made forces, La Resistencia movement leaders and their allies are standing up to fight the facility and what it represents, mindful of those who’ve been targeted and whose rights have been taken, just as so many of their ancestors’ labor, land, and natural resources were—and continue to be—taken. The GEO Group is paid by the federal government to house people there, and is guaranteed a minimum number of detainees, causing the people detained in the facility to be valued as commodities. As the rain continued to pour, the protesters were quickly drenched, yet they remained, resolute and unified in their demands. Rufina Reyes, director of the La Resistencia, led the group by declaring: “¡No están solo!” Her voice was amplified loud enough for the sound waves to echo off the detention facility’s walls. The crowd echoed in unison, “You are not alone!” The sound waves of the calls interweaved like a multilingual prayer sanctified by the heavy rain and wind.“We’re opposed to detentions and deportations, and we don’t want any more family separation!” Reyes shouted through an interpreter. The volcanic mountain known as Tahoma towered above the valley and flatlands. Prior to the construction of the GEO Group’s detention facility, the site was a rich tidal estuary, known by many names, and was the ancestral homeland of the Puyallup people since time immemorial. Following colonization, conflict, and the eventual signing of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in 1854, the land was settled by American immigrants. Still, the Puyallup Tribe retains certain rights over the area as a result of the 1854 treaty and the subsequent Land Claims Settlement Act of 1990. In the immediate area where the detention facility would be built, fill was brought in or dredged from the river estuary to serve as a foundation for a meat processing and packing plant that opened in 1904, a Standard Oil fuel storage and distribution facility that opened in 1905, and a coal gasification plant that opened in 1924. The coal gasification plant operated until 1956 and was demolished in 1966. The fuel storage and distribution facility, later owned by Chevron, operated through 1988 and included 13 above-ground and four underground fuel storage tanks, three petroleum pipelines, and numerous garages. The GEO Group now owns the site and parks its vehicles on it. A metals recycling facility was constructed immediately southeast of the future detention site by 1967. This facility recycled cars and electrical transformers, polluting the area with PCBs and heavy metals. The coal gasification site, the meatpacking site, and the metals recycling site would later be designated as a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Washington State Department of Ecology has stated that the EPA Superfund site around the detention facility is remediated, “capped” by layers of supposedly impermeable barriers, asphalt, and crumbled cement from the meatpacking facility. It now resembles an innocuous mound covered, bizarrely, in green grass. But an underground benzene plume exists just below the surface, not far from the southern edge of the property line where the detention facility now stands. In 1988, a 3,500-gallon underground oil storage tank had to be removed, and along with it, 376 tons (752,000 pounds) of petroleum-affected soil and over 8,000 gallons of petroleum-affected groundwater. Yet more remained. Adding to the petroleum contamination, the nearby Standard Oil facility, which Chevron now owns, leaked petroleum products into the soil, contaminating the surrounding groundwater. Washington state Department of Ecology’s groundwater monitoring wells have detected diesel and heavy oil in wells just outside the walls of the detention facility as recently as November 2024. MTCA Method A Cleanup Levels is a regulatory approach used under Washington State’s Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) to establish acceptable levels of contaminants in soil, groundwater, and other environmental media during site cleanups. In 1996, Correction Services Corporation, now owned by GEO Group, began searching for a site to build a migrant detention facility near Seattle. After considering several locations in neighboring towns, they ultimately landed on 1623 E. J Street in Tacoma. Then Tacoma City Council member Kevin Phelps was a vocal supporter of this location, citing economic benefits, specifically business and occupation taxes the city would garner. GEO Group was issued contract revenue bonds by The Washington Economic Development Finance Authority in 2003 for $57,415,000 and in 2011 for $54,375,000 to construct and expand the facility. Washington Representatives at the time, Adam Smith and Norm Dicks worked alongside Tacoma city leaders to persuade GEO Group to seek to build the facility atop the Superfund site. Dick and Smith didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Senator Patty Murray would also support the site’s construction of this facility on this location as early as 2002. Smith later opposed the GEO Group’s facility receiving another contract. Murray later scrutinized the facility, but nonetheless had accepted campaign contributions from the GEO Group in the amount of $5,000 in 2016. Senator Murray and her staff didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment for this story. Along with Representative Pramila Jayapal, Smith wrote a letter in July 2024 to the then-secretary of DHS urging it to move away from the use of private for-profit migrant detention facilities. Jayapal previously founded a non-profit organization that partnered with the Seattle University School of Law to produce a report on the human rights abuses at the facility. The city council adopted a resolution approving the facility on March 28, 2000, stating, “CSC [GEO Group] has an excellent reputation in the communities where it has facilities.” However, a local news report published in 2004, when the facility was being finished and opened, cited a 1995 riot at another GEO-acquired facility (under the name of Esmor Correctional Services) in New Jersey that led to a federal investigation. “Three guards at the facility were later convicted of misconduct and sent to prison,” a Tacoma News Tribune report stated as the Northwest Detention Center was about to open. Between 2018 and 2024, GEO Group paid Pierce County, where the detention facility is located, roughly $5,643,100 in property taxes. The city responded to questions about the total amount paid by GEO Group in business and occupation taxes, stating that such information could not be divulged because it is confidential. The GEO Group, Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida, has received $6.85 billion since July 2009 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which, since 2003, has included ICE. $995.08 million of this has been obligated to the GEO Group in Washington state. Congress’s 2025 Trump-supported continuing resolution allocates nearly $10 billion for ICE. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) estimated that the continuing resolution allocates approximately $350 billion for immigration enforcement and argues, however, that it does not include checks and balances on Trump’s mass detention and deportation plans, nor allow for a legal pathway to citizenship. “Under our legal system, the rule of law also requires fairness and respect for due process, but the Trump-controlled Senate rejected any proposal to inject those principles into the bill passed yesterday,” stated AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson in a press release. Trump has recently defied court orders regarding the detention and deportation of migrants, invoking a law used to justify the internment of Japanese-Americans, German-Americans, and Italian-Americans during World War II to loosely classify some Venezuelans as members of Tren de Aragua, a gang designated as a foreign terrorist organization by his administration, without due process of law. Trump’s framing of non-white migrants as criminals and subhuman since his political rise in 2015 has served as the basis for his policies that disproportionately target vulnerable non-white people who once immigrated to the U.S. Meanwhile, those within the financial industry are profiting from the Trump Administration’s policies’ “potential sea change.” GEO Group’s top five shareholders are BlackRock, Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc., Wolf Hill Capital Management, LP, FMR, LLC, and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2024. Pam Bondi, Trump’s current Attorney General, was formerly a lobbyist for the GEO Group, which has contributed over $2.7 billion to Trump and Republicans from 2016 to 2024, including members of Congress who voted against certifying the 2020 election and promoted the Big Lie that the election was stolen. Two days after Trump’s re-election on November 5th, 2024, GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley told his company’s shareholders during an earnings call that Trump’s “more aggressive policy” toward interior and border immigration enforcement means a “potential sea change” for the company he leads. “The GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company’s—country’s history and the opportunities that it will bring,” Zoley said. He said GEO Group could increase the number of detainee beds from 13,500 to 31,000. In the days following Trump’s election, the value of GEO Group stock nearly doubled and peaked on January 21, 2025, Trump’s Inauguration Day. The apparent commoditization of human beings, in addition to allegations that migrants detained are essentially forced labor, is reminiscent of some of the darkest chapters of human history. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, recently suggested Trump’s aspirational deportation machine should run more like a business, treating people like products being shipped. Before and between Trump’s terms, Democrats also sought to expand the role of DHS and ICE. The Biden administration took actions to expand immigration detention prior to the end of his term. Then Vice President and two-time presidential candidate Harris clearly stated her opposition to migration from Central and South America when, in June 2021, she spoke in Guatemala, unequivocally, saying to potential migrants, “Do not come. Do not come.” La Resistencia has dedicated over eleven years to shutting down the migrant detention center. Its Founder, Maru Mora-Villalpando, grew up in Mexico and was influenced by strong leaders, including her mother and grandfather, a union leader. They taught her the importance of supporting laborers on strike, which, she said, was common in Mexico. She recalled working to support striking workers by getting on a public bus, shaking a can with coins, requesting donations while talking with people about the importance of supporting striking workers, and passing out informational flyers. She also recalled riding with her mother and passing a group of striking workers when she was young. Their flag was grayed from age, and her mother said this was because of how long they’d been fighting, adding, “We also need to support them. In order for them to win, we all need to support them.” “They end[ed] up winning,” she said. ICE has allegedly targeted Mora-Villalpando specifically, as well as other activists, including, more recently, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a farm labor rights activist who is currently being detained at the GEO Group facility. According to a lawsuit filed, in part, on her behalf as well as on behalf of other activists allegedly targeted by ICE, Mora-Villalpando was surveilled, then explicitly targeted by ICE, which initiated deportation proceedings against her, specifically for her activism defending human and immigrant rights. DHS ultimately dropped deportation charges against Mora-Villalpando. The lawsuit is ongoing. On September 15, 2024, La Resistencia posted on Instagram stating, “URGENT. Yesterday a woman in the women’s unit at NWDC suffered [a] fainting [sic] and headaches that were caused by a strong smell of gas. #GEO staff failed to address this issue.” According to Mora-Villalpando, this woman was taken for medical observation and returned an hour later. People detained and impacted said the strong smell of gas and sulfur was unbearable. They thought it was coming from the air conditioning vent, mentioning the door to the yard was left open because of it. According to detained people, one GEO officer said they, too, were suffering from a headache due to the smell of gas. Other GEO officers who later came into the unit stated they couldn’t smell anything, according to detained persons familiar with the event, who opined it was because they didn’t want to acknowledge a possible gas leak. Unit B-3 is located in the northernmost part of the detention facility, where groundwater and soil monitoring and tests have revealed for over 30 years the presence of diesel fuel and heavy oil. More recently, on a video posted on March 12, a person detained at the GEO Group’s facility stated via video chat to leaders of La Resistencia that clothes coming back laundered are still wet, smell like mildew, and “smell like diesel fuel.” The laundry room is also located in the northernmost part of the detention facility. Mora-Villalpando stated that a fire occurred in this area the previous year, which she and others witnessed while outside in solidarity. According to Mora-Villalpando and Liliana Chumpitasi, leader and community organizer with La Resistencia, these instances weren’t the first time detainees smelled gas in the facility. The group reported to The Margin that detained people identified the smell of gas when the sinks were clogged, and water was leaking from above the showers. In another incident detailed by the group, detained people communicated to La Resistencia that a gas smell also came from the showers. Per a 2024 lawsuit, the Washington State Department of Health has fielded over 700 complaints in the past year from people detained in the GEO Group’s facility, including reports that “the water is brown and possibly contaminated.” The project lead of the state’s toxics cleanup of the Chevron bulk terminal facility, Thomas Praisewater, stated in an interview with The Margin that while he has not heard about any toxins, it is hypothetically possible these toxins have infiltrated the detention facility’s drinking water. Praisewater has been working with Chevron’s consultant, AECOM, on the cleanup of the bulk fuel storage and distribution facility that was once across the street, a site now occupied by vehicles used by ICE and GEO. Another expert has also said petroleum products may have made their way up through the soil and into the detention facility’s water pipes. Marc A. Edwards, a Distinguished Professor in environmental and water resources engineering at Virginia Tech, told The Margin that gas and other petroleum products can go through or diffuse through porous plastic water pipes. Edwards, who worked on the scientific team that found lead contamination in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, said, in particular, polyethylene pipes are susceptible to such infiltration. Praisewater made similar statements that if there is, in fact, contamination, it would likely be because of a break or corrosion in the detention facility’s water system. Furthermore, it is unclear if GEO Group installed vapor intrusion barriers, rather than vapor barriers; the former being designed to potentially prevent infiltration of toxic chemicals. A 2009 toxicological evaluation by the EPA of the NWDC indicated that a vapor intrusion barrier was not installed. The City of Tacoma water department told The Margin that municipal water piped to the facility is clean. According to records from the City of Tacoma in 2009 and 2010, the city approved occupancy permits for renovations to the building based on GEO Group’s detention facility building permit, which meets the 2006 International Building Code standards, requiring third-party certified plastic pipes that conform to NSF 14 standards. NSF 14 standards include polyethylene pipes. The Margin is waiting for the release of records requested via state open records laws from the city to further determine the potential water contamination. Despite state legislation requiring the Washington State Department of Health to monitor air and water quality in facilities such as the GEO Group’s detention facility that was signed into law May 11, 2023 as House Bill 1470, the company has fought and denied at least four attempts to inspect the water in all parts of the facility, only allowing access to the lobby and its bathroom. The state health department attempted to test the water in the detention facility but was denied access by GEO facility administrators acting on behalf of ICE supervisors. Joe Wesley Barbee, Jr., the distribution optimization advisor for the operations and training section of the state health department office of drinking water, stated in a declaration included in a lawsuit filed by the state against the GEO Group, that the Department of Health received complaints from individuals detained in GEO Group’s facility between April 2023 and mid-July 2024. Barbee described these complaints as being about the water’s temperature, color, smell, and the absence of water from faucets. “Detainees have complained about incidents where there is no water to drink, flush toilets, or otherwise use, and other incidents where the tap water is brown,” he stated. But when Barbee arrived at the GEO Group’s facility, he was met by the facility administrator, Bruce Scott, and two unidentified people, who allowed him only to test water from a faucet in a restroom near the front lounge area, apart from the secured part of the facility where detainees are held. “The testing environment was under intense scrutiny by the facility staff and the supervisor, who asked questions about every step and every chemical/reagent I used,” Barbee stated in the lawsuit. He added that typically, a water test in a bathroom sink wouldn’t be acceptable for quality tests. “The administrator asked for identical samples of any water I took,” Barbee said.“I welcome them to prove us wrong, but they closed their doors even more,” said Representative Lillian Ortiz-Self (WA-21), who introduced House Bill 1232 in the state legislature that amends parts of House Bill 1470, which a federal judge partly blocked, saying it singled out GEO Group. HB 1232, which amended the law to include other facilities, was passed by the legislature on April 14 along party lines and signed into law by Governor Bob Ferguson on May 12. Part of the current legislation would require the Department of Health to specifically investigate complaints, monitor air and water quality, and publicly report findings on routine unannounced inspections of the facility, and to post these results in multiple languages for detainees and the public. It would also expand the facilities it covers to facilities other than the GEO Group detention facility in Tacoma. GEO Group had argued that HB 1470 was unconstitutional, alleging it violated the Constitution’s supremacy clause, stating ICE was the authority that denied the state access to the entire facility. “They have refused to be more transparent, and instead, the complaints have doubled and continue to increase. We continue to have hunger strikes and complaints and suicide attempts,” Rep. Ortiz-Self told The Margin. “A couple questions come to mind: How much money do you want to make off of people suffering? And you know we’re looking at you, so do you care that little that you think you can continue to treat people this way? And if you’re treating them that way, knowing that we have our eyes on you, what’s really happening inside? We’re really scared for everyone that’s in there,” she said. “What are they hiding?” Rep. Ortiz-Self asked. U.S. Marshals have recently confirmed a separate GEO Group detention facility in Laredo, Texas, to be exposing detainees to carbon monoxide, which families of the detainees allege sicken detainees without adequate medical treatment. GEO Group previously denied the presence of the deadly gas. The local fire department required GEO Group to take corrective action, according to an April 17th KGNS news report. In addition to having no choice but to drink potentially contaminated water, independent experts have alleged human rights abuses in complaints since the GEO detention facility was first opened in 2004. A 2008 report by OneAmerica and the International Human Rights Clinic at Seattle University School of Law identified major issues, including the unnecessary detention of refugees, conditions violating legal due process protections, especially the forced signing of papers, lack of access to attorneys, and failure to ensure confidential communications. Other concerns included overcrowding and lack of privacy, inadequate emergency medical care and pain management, inhuman and degrading treatment by guards and U.S. Marshals, failure to adequately address mental health issues and punitive segregation of those with mental health problems, extremely poor quality and quantity of food, inadequate visitation time, and long waits and inadequate access to telephones. Several reports by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) have documented similar abuses since then. These include complaints of being served uncooked or worm-infested food, allegations of medical neglect, extensive use of solitary confinement, COVID-19 response and health standard issues, reports of sexual assault and abuse going unanswered, and complaints about the use of force and chemical agents. Suicide attempts at the facility are another especially significant issue. The UWCHR obtained 911 calls and detailed at least six suicide attempts from January 1 to March 18, 2024, alone. From August 2017 to April 2023, the UWCHR identified at least an additional 12 suicide attempts as categorized by South Sound 911. A man with Russian citizenship who was seeking asylum died following a suicide attempt while detained in segregation (or what UWCHR would define as solitary confinement). Records of 911 calls obtained by The Margin via open records law detail at least an additional eight suicide attempts since April 2023. In one of the most recent attempts on February 9, 2025, a detention facility representative tells a 911 dispatcher that medical assistance is needed for a man who had cut his wrists. A 2024 report by the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman found the detention center did not consistently complete 15-minute checks of detainees on suicide watch, and did not strictly control and collect disposable razors. Another 911 call obtained by The Margin via open records law details a man who had hit his head “multiple times” on the wall. In yet another recent suicide attempt, on March 12, a man jumped off the upper tier to the lower tier, according to a 911 audio recording obtained by The Margin. This audio contains sensitive material that may be distressing to some listeners, including discussions of violence, trauma, or strong language. 911 Records obtained by The Margin via public records law give a very general description of numerous other incidents, including 17 calls regarding molestation/groping from October 2021 through January 2025, and six calls alleging rape from February 2023 through June 2024. In a report published in 2022, the UWCHR reviewed several data sources from approximately 2012 to 2019 and found 63 reports of sexual assault or abuse. These included allegations by detainees against other detainees, alleged harassment by a GEO Group officer, and alleged sexual assault by medical staff. More recently, on April 24, UWCHR published a report finding the City of Tacoma Police Department failed to respond to allegations of assault and sexual assault made by detainees. A City of Tacoma spokesperson provided the following response via email: “We are currently reviewing the concerns outlined in the report recently published by the University of Washington. If our review identifies opportunities to better align with our mission in serving those at the [NWDC], we are committed to making necessary improvements and further strengthening our procedures. Our goal is to ensure that safety, security, and respect for rights remain central to our role.” People detained at the NWDC have also died there. On March 7, 2024, Charles Leo Daniel died while in solitary confinement of undetermined causes. According to UWHRC, Daniel had spent nearly the entirety of his four years at the NWDC in solitary confinement despite being classified as having significant mental illness. La Resistencia told The Margin Senator Patty Murray was touring the facility the day of his death. On October 27, 2024, Jose Manuel Sanchez-Castro also died at the NWDC. According to reporting by The Seattle Times, he was in fentanyl withdrawal. Yet autopsy results have yet to be released. In 2018, another person died by suicide at the NWDC, according to a press release from Rep. Jayapal, who stated that when she visited the facility following Daniel’s death, she wasn’t allowed to speak with detained people. Angelina Godoy, Director of the UWCHR, told The Margin there’s a total lack of accountability regarding the GEO Group’s detention facility in Tacoma because the systems that are there to provide accountability, such as Congress, have utterly failed, “to take any effective action to ensure that conditions within the Northwest Detention Center are even up to ICE’s own standards, which would fall far below international human rights standards.” The recent UWCHR report states “Conditions are critical within the NWDC today, and outside facility walls, we are all witness to a still-unfolding series of federal government policies that revel in the cruel and public dehumanization of immigrants.” The state’s lawsuit against the GEO Group, which seeks to prevent GEO Group from denying the entry of state officials under state law to investigate complaints, states, “As alleged, these complaints present clear threats to detainee health and safety at [the detention facility].” The Margin has requested these complaints via state public records law but has yet to receive them. The Washington State Department of Health, currently in litigation with the GEO Group, has declined to provide an interview to The Margin on the matter. A Washington State Department of Health spokesperson stated in an emailed response to The Margin: “The Washington State Department of Health is aware of many of these and other complaints. We are committed to gain entry to the facility and investigate these complaints. The Northwest ICE Processing Center continues to deny entry to our staff. We are hopeful that the federal courts will bring clarity to the department’s authority and that the facility will allow entry for investigations, transparency, and the welfare of all people inside the facility.” A GEO Group Spokesperson provided the following response via email: “The support services GEO provides at… the Northwest ICE Processing Center, are governed by ICE’s detention standards. GEO’s services are carefully monitored for quality by ICE personnel, who are onsite 24/7… The locations where GEO supports ICE are also independently accredited by the American Correctional Association, as well as the National Commission on Correctional Health Care…” A GEO Group spokesperson further stated via email: “GEO strongly disagrees with the allegations that have been made regarding the services we provide at the Northwest ICE Processing Center. These allegations are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government’s immigration facility contractors. GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. These policies are governed by Performance-Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” The GEO Group provided these general responses, but did not respond to The Margin’s detailed questions. “That’s what detention centers are… an extension of the prison system.” Rufina Reyes, director of La Resistencia, hails from Guerrero state, Mexico. She emigrated to the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of economic opportunity. “I’m Mexican,” Reyes said through an interpreter. “I’m an immigrant. I consider myself undocumented. I’m a mom, I’m a wife, and I believe that most of the people that are in La Resistencia are here because we have been affected by the system.” Reyes has held a work permit for the past two years. Reyes’ brother fled his home in Mexico following his kidnapping by a local organized crime group. Fortunately, he was released, unlike many others, according to Reyes, who have been disappeared. He came to the U.S. and was later detained in the NWDC. She went to find her brother at the detention center, and when she came out, La Resistencia was holding an action outside. She began volunteering with La Resistencia, answering phone calls on the group’s hotline. Some of the most impactful calls, she said, were those in which the person on the other end of the line said that they wanted to harm themselves or when she found out one person had died inside. This intimacy with despair and injustice catalyzed her, and she realized she had to do something more about it. “I have to continue fighting this, not just for my brother, but because possibly one day also I may be in there, and so I want to keep fighting for every single person that is not able to defend themselves,” she said. In addition to the violence and corruption of her home state, climate change has brought intensified cycles of drought and flooding that have made it extremely difficult for people to subsistence farm or grow food to sell there. As a result, so many have been forced to migrate, she added. Climate change impacts have been overwhelmingly driven by countries of the Global North, including the U.S. Reyes recounted how Mora-Villalpando reached out to her when she walked out of the detention facility in Tacoma after visiting her brother. “She told me who she was, she offered support, and she told me a little bit about what the people were talking about, the conditions inside. She said, ‘You’re not alone. Here’s my number. Call me if anything comes up,” Reyes said. Reyes has since risen through the ranks of La Resistencia to direct the Organization, as Mora-Villalpando has transitioned to an advisory position. “I call it a detention center because everybody knows them as detention centers, but they’re cages,” Mora-Villalpando said. “That’s the result of allowing governments to decide who’s worthy of what. If you are forced to migrate, you’re already being shaped into what you’re supposed to be, what you’re supposed to have, and what you’re not supposed to have, and what you don’t have is because ‘you deserve it,’” she said ironically. She said an ideology is formed where people agree that some people deserve to be caged. “That’s what detention centers are,” she said. “I’ve always said they’re an extension of the prison system.” In this case, the private, for-profit prison system.“The idea has been not only how these white invaders took over our continents,” she added, “but how they continue to be exploiting. They already have our land, they already have our labor, they already have our mind, and now they want to have our bodies to further capital—by having these cages, these storage places, where you [store] people like boxes, and you still make money off them,” she concluded.

Gerrit Kazmaier on what AI can really do and the quest to make enterprise software suck less. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Gerrit Kazmaier, the new president of product and technology at Workday, an enterprise software company. Decoder listeners probably know the name Workday; a lot of companies use its platform for HR and finance management, which the suits have started bundling into a phrase they call “human capital management.” I invite you to have whatever feelings you want about that. Anyhow, if you’ve been applying to jobs lately, you have certainly run into Workday, and you are almost certainly frustrated with it. I mean, I’ll just say this from the jump: it’s rare that enterprise software executives come on this show, because it’s a guarantee that I will ask them why everyone hates enterprise software and what they’re doing to fix it. Workday is no exception; last year, Business Insider literally published an article titled “Everybody hates Workday.” Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Gerrit’s new on the job, maybe a little bit braver than most, and, to his credit, he came on the show and took the heat. We spent a lot of time talking about what enterprise software really is, what it does, and why it has a reputation for being so deeply frustrating for so many people. As you’ll hear, the heart of this conversation is a major tension that exists between software as just a tool to get some work done and the idea that using a software tool is actually a job. And everyone experiences software like Workday in totally different ways across a company. I mean, just think about it: for most people in a company, Workday is mostly just a database, a series of forms they’re required to fill out to file expenses or log a performance review. For people who actually work in HR and finance, using Workday is actually their job. And then the C-suite, which makes a lot of decisions using data generated by tools like Workday, might never actually use the software at all, instead just looking at reports other people generate from it. You will not be totally surprised to hear that Gerrit’s solution to a lot of these issues is to use AI — after all, Workday now calls itself an “AI platform.” So I really wanted to know what Gerrit thinks about what role AI is going to play in workplace software and if letting AI fill out all those forms for people might make things better — or just result in bad data everywhere. And I really wanted to know how comfortable he was letting AI make decisions about finance and HR, because AI systems can have lots of bias built into them. That’s something lots of companies, including Workday, have already faced lawsuits over. Look, I told you there’s a reason enterprise software executives don’t come on this show often. So hats off to Gerrit for hanging in there — I think you’ll like this one. Okay: Gerrit Kazmaier, Workday’s president of product and technology. Here we go. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Gerrit Kazmaier, you’re the president of product and technology at Workday. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you for having me, Nilay. Excited to be here. I’m excited to talk to you for a variety of reasons. One, enterprise software executives don’t often want to come on the show because I just ask them about the nature of enterprise software, so you’re very brave. Thank you for coming on. And then second, you’re the new guy. You just started in March, so you don’t have to defend all the stuff that other people did. You can just be honest about it. Exactly. And hey, maybe you just don’t invite so many enterprise executives. So I don’t know. Maybe I can lure some more in. My threat is always that we’ll just use the software together live, but it’s an audio podcast, so don’t worry. We’re not going to do that today. Workday is one of those pieces of software that maybe everybody encounters in the course of their career. You apply to a job, Workday is the interface; you’re at a job, it’s your finance system. It’s “human capital management” — I think that’s what we call it now, when you’re doing your performance reviews. How do you think about Workday? What is this thing? So it’s this incredible system that helps organizations on the one side manage their people and manage their money, which is great. Well, two of the most important assets our corporation is built upon. But I think more importantly, like what you have said, right, when you think about everyday work experience, it’s the systems that everyone touches, everyone interacts with, and I think makes a huge difference in having a great work experience and ultimately great personal development and building a great career. So yeah, it’s a system of work and it’s very exciting to be here. There’s a lot of companies that want to describe themselves as the backbone of how you might do work. We had web service companies come on, Squarespace come on, and say we’re the operating system for small businesses. You book the class or you book the auto mechanic and then we’ll do the billing and finance. Workday is also expressed like that in some way, right? You’ve got people, you’ve got money, they’re moving through your system, they’re spending the money. You’re tracking what the people are doing and if they’re performing well. Do you want the big picture of, We’re running the entire business in Workday? You know, it’s funny, right, because I think that’s kind of an archaic way to think about systems and people altogether because actually enterprise software is an ecosystem. Organizations are large and touch many domains and people and money is important, but there is also customer, right? There is service. There are so many things, right? There are so many things that makes a company and there’s so many things that make a work experience that I’d argue that back in the old days, when you look into the, I don’t know, the legacy enterprise software systems, that they had this idea of that perfectly walled garden, and Hey, there’s going to be one door you enter in the morning and you’re going to stay in that door and we are going to give you what that system has to offer, and that’s it, right? And I think today’s reality is that it is not reflective of what makes a great enterprise software stack. You have a multitude of vendors offering different capabilities and you have to compose them together to reflect what really is important to your company. Secondly, I think it’s about the work experience, from people bringing their own devices today, now bringing in their own AI models, more often than not their own AI coding experiences, meaning that they also have way more agency about the systems they use and the systems they expect to use, right? So you have collaboration and productivity and that’s something very specialized and you have enterprise systems for all sorts of purposes, and I actually think it’s about an intelligent ecosystem and being part of — I would describe it as an enterprise software fabric, if you will, where it is really important that vendors like Workday work with other vendors in the industry and build that system so that customers can use them in orchestration without having that kind of ridiculous idea, right? “Oh, you get everything from one [vendor] and you have to be happy with that.” I mean, how would that work? I mean, you have a long career in enterprise software, but that is a trend across every enterprise business product that I’ve ever encountered, where you start with one part of the business and then the line everyone uses: We want to be the operating system for your business. We want to take everything. And it sounds like you’re just totally against that. I think I’m totally for a vibrant software ecosystem, and if you think about it, it starts with an operating system. I think that’s a great metaphor, but it’s also something that I think we have to evolve, right? Back in the old days when we said “operating system,” it was this monolithic piece and everything had to run on it. And then came along the web and suddenly, well, what you had on your operating system was not the only thing that you could use because when you were on your device you could access web services and online services, too. So when we say “operating system,” what is the operating system? You might say, “Well, it’s a specific software platform and only the things that run on it are allowed,” right? And I would say, “Well, I guess the operating system today is the browser and everything which relies on HTTP as part of my operating system ecosystem.” And in the AI world you might say it’s an operating system that is defined by MCP, or model context protocol, and we have an orchestration of agents. So I do think operating systems are important because they actually define how an ecosystem works. They define standards and they define very important shared interests, security being one of them. So those are all things that no one would want to give up on, but I don’t think they’re single-source, single-vendor, monolithic pieces anymore that just create one experience. I think I would say it’s a dated way of thinking about enterprise software, actually. There’s a real push and pull here and there’s a reason I’m starting in this kind of esoteric space. I think a lot about what work is, like what are we all doing? And in the age where there’s a big push and pull between remote work and in-office work and what those experiences are, so much of our jobs just every day is using software. You and I are talking right now through a piece of software called Riverside that is quite cranky, but on one very basic level, my job is just using Riverside a few times a week. The things I can do at my job are limited in some ways by Riverside, but they’re enabled in huge ways by the software existing. You see that with every kind of enterprise software, right? There are enormous numbers of HR and finance professionals who show up to work every day, and what they do is they use Workday in one way or another. There’s executives who receive reports from Workday and their job is just evaluating the information Workday has compiled for them and then making some decisions based on it. How do you see the role of the software there? Because what it looks like and how it works and what it’s for is all pretty dependent on the fact that some people’s jobs are just using the software. It’s an interesting way to think about a job, right? Because when you said, “It’s my job to use Riverside,” I actually thought maybe that’s not true. Maybe your job is asking powerful questions and talking to many people and creating a show that engages listeners. Riverside, the software piece that you have just mentioned, is just something that allows you to do your job really well, right? I think the same applies when we think about Workday. People have important jobs to do. They try to hire great candidates. Once they hire great candidates, they try to onboard them and train them in the way a company works. They want to build thriving organizations that let people have a really good work experience. They want to manage performance, and they want to reward and recognize people. Those are the jobs on the HR side. On the finance side, it’s as simple, right? You ship products, you want to write bills, and you have to pay bills, and you want to create a compliant profit-and-loss statement and you want to be financially responsible and viable in the long term and manage your cash position and so forth. And those are the jobs, right? Now, basically the question is what do you have available in terms of tools and software that allows you to do a job in the best possible way? That’s the core of Workday, right? Workday says that for the jobs that you have, which are software independent, which are emergent from the very core thing that you do as your value creation, we are going to give you the best services and products to everything related to people and money. I think that’s a very important focus to get this straight because sometimes I do think people get confused, specifically in technology. AI is a wonderful example of that, by the way. Because now some people think maybe the job is AI. Maybe that’s my job, to do something with AI, and there is a certain thrill and excitement that goes with that. But ultimately, there is a reason that when you look at studies… for instance, Stanford has that AI Index Report, and it’s a beautiful 400-page read on the state of AI, and part of that survey is that enterprise leaders get asked about their returns on the AI investment and the vast majority said AI gave them less than 5 percent top-line increase and less than 5 percent bottom-line efficiency. You wonder with all of that investment, how can that be? And I think ultimately it’s because there is a confusion that some people think, “Maybe that my job is AI,” but actually it’s not. The job is what you’re trying to do for your business, and AI may be a powerful way for you to do this job better, and for software vendors like Workday, it’s the same. How can we help people manage their money and people better through AI and being focused on the real job versus on the technical means that facilitates a certain way of doing that job? I saw a similar survey from IBM where they surveyed CEOs and the results were only 25 percent of the AI projects had returned on the investment. So we’re in this place where everyone’s spending the money, you guys are spending the money on AI — we’re going to talk about that — and no one knows why. I’m sure you have an answer. But I see that piece. Then there’s the other piece of AI. The reason people are investing so much money in it is because maybe the AI can use the software or maybe the AI will fill out the forms or, and this is the big promise, the AI will do the boring stuff. Workday, I think a lot of people have expressed, is the boring stuff in their job, right? They’re filling out expense reports or whatever. You have all the way up to agentic AI, which is actually doing stuff and making decisions. How do you see that interaction? Is AI going to use more and more of Workday for people? First of all, I would say Workday is the exciting stuff, so. [Laughs] You have to. I appreciate that you have to say that Workday is the exciting stuff. Because I think sometimes when we say, “What’s the exciting stuff?” I actually think... Well, like you said, I worked in enterprise software my entire career, but actually all of the enterprise software businesses that I was a part of, they’re people businesses 100 percent, right? You drive all of your work through and with people and teams. So managing that and growing and managing people, that’s an exciting part of the job and Workday is that system in which you make that happen. So this is why I’m saying it’s the exciting stuff — for me, Workday is more than doing a PTO request. But can I ask you about this? Yeah, of course. Managing people is the exciting part of the job, sure. As somebody who manages people, there are days I agree, there are days I disagree. I don’t think about this software as the management, right? And maybe it’s just that I work in a creative field and our conversations about management are very different, but there’s not a place where I’m like, “I’m going to use this software and that will accomplish a management task.” It’s much more like, “I’ve accomplished the management tasks and now I need to record it in this software just so I remember what happened.” But there’s a confusion there, right? I think whether or not what happens in the database is real life is maybe the central confusion of the entire tech industry across the board. It might be the central confusion at the highest levels of our government right now, but how do you see Workday closing that gap, if at all? Is it even possible to close that gap? I totally think it’s possible to close this gap. I see us having closed that gap and increasingly closed that gap in certain domains. But I completely agree with you, right? Work is so complex and it happens in so many ways, and it’s not, like I said earlier, it’s not that it’s all happening in one system only. It’s an ecosystem. So I completely agree with that point, and some of the work is even offline. Like you said, it’s talking to someone. As simple as that. But there are domains, for instance, like in the recruiting space. How do I build recruiting campaigns? How do I interview people? When I interview people, how do I select candidates that are best fit for the job on something more profound than pedigree, but skills, and skills that they have shown or skills that I can infer? Those are actions. This is work where work genuinely happens to a significant degree in a system like Workday. So it may not be happening everywhere, I agree with that, and maybe it shouldn’t even happen for everything everywhere. But there is a significant portion where professionals actually do their job in these systems and that’s why I think it’s so important to get them right. I haven’t had to use Workday in a long time, so to prepare for this interview, I watched a lot of Workday training videos on YouTube. Amazing ecosystem of Workday training videos on YouTube, I have to say. It just occurred to me as I was watching some of this stuff that Workday is expressed to people as a database very openly. It’s a database or maybe a spreadsheet in some of the other interfaces, and people applying to a job experience it as a series of forms to be filled out. Again, when I say, “You use the software to accomplish the task,” a lot of the task is making sure the database has the right information in it. That runs sort of headlong into AI, right? Now you’ve got people using AI to generate the information for the database or you’ve got an AI system that’s going to look at a receipt and figure out what it is and put it in the right fields. That’s a new kind of data risk there, where you’re definitely going to get all the fields filled in. If there’s one thing generative AI can do, it’s fill in the fields with little effort, but it might be hallucinations. It might be garbage. It might be worse than if a human didn’t fill out the field at all. How are you thinking about that risk? I think what you’re describing is a question of maturity, actually, of maturity in both ways, both technology and use. AI is undeniably the most profound change in technology, and I think we are just living through the beginning of a renaissance of what AI can deliver. In any domain — material, science, medicine, and enterprise software being just one of them — people are solving problems in incredible ways with the use of AI. As a person, between you and I, humankind has big challenges, very big challenges, and I think it’s a wonderful opportunity to have broken one of these big technology boundaries on reasoning and judgment and knowledge compression and being able to use that on virtually any domain that exists. So I think that is incredible. But what you just spoke about is the flip side of that, right? It’s new, and the reality is that we have intuitions about it. We have an intuition that a computer program is right because it’s deterministic, so there is an intuition that goes alongside using a computer. When you talk to a person, that is different because we know that we have biases, we get stuff wrong, and there’s a different type of intuition that we have than what we expect a computer program to do. Now we have these generative AI models and like you have said, they’re probabilistic. They’re not deterministic in many ways, and even very subtle things change their behavior and things that we wouldn’t expect them to do. It was just I think last week or the week before, this outcry of the latest OpenAI model, and I think it was called the sycophancy of it. Yeah. It was too nice. Yeah. [Laughs] Because it was too nice, and it was actually a few small changes that dramatically changed the behavior of the model, making it too nice and not really helpful anymore. So what you just spoke about, when we think about AI specifically in an enterprise context, I think the big point is that AI gets you to a lot of results really quickly. It’s so powerful, but in many ways it is really shallow. In the enterprise space, for instance, we take one of these very powerful models, we give it a really good prompt that is reflective of a business problem, and the model gives us something and it looks roughly good and we say, “Oh, yeah. We got it solved.” We are happy about that. But the reality is then you actually want to make it work with accuracy expectations that you need to have in order to be used in a professional context, or that someone makes mission-critical decisions upon. Or in cases, and this is very important, where someone cannot correct the model in a direct way. Coding is a good example. Why is coding successful? The model gives you something back in a modality that you understand as a coder, right? You know what the model is doing. You see the code. You have a chance to lean in. That’s why it took off so quickly there. Because you basically spoke the same language with the model and that was a big corrective. And in an enterprise system, like what you have said, you have to fill out this complex form for maybe a process that you don’t even fully understand yourself. And it has language that is legal and compliant that is alien to you, and the model’s doing something [on its own]. How do you know? That is actually the big difference. I guess I would be a little more reductive. I would describe the problem here as garbage in, garbage out, right? The promise of so much enterprise software, particularly HR finance software, is if you just had more information, you would get better decisions. If everyone would just fill out all of the fields, if only everybody would just fill out the software correctly, we would have better perfect real-time information about the business and then we would make better decisions. What AI is doing, maybe not built into Workday but just in general, is that now people with a ChatGPT app on their phone can definitely fill out all of the fields, 100 percent. You already see it in job applications. People are applying to a thousand times more jobs than they were before because they can just fire a copy into these job applications from ChatGPT, and now the systems are overwhelmed with irrelevant information. So you’ve got garbage in. What on Earth? Like, how do you solve this problem in the context of having to turn that into actionable information? Yeah, I think it’s two points. And I do want to go back quickly to what I would describe as the challenge of shallow enterprise IP before we get to what you just said about how we cope with the new behaviors that are emergent with the use of AI. I would actually challenge what you said. Models get it wrong a lot, specifically when you talk about something that is not in the public domain. So we have public knowledge, and models are extremely good at compressing this knowledge. They’re terrific. Who would’ve thought? I think everyone was surprised in 2022 when [chat bots] really broke through and how powerful the technology would become with actually a very simplistic mathematical model. That’s the mind-boggling insight. The math is simple. It’s just applied at volume and it produces these incredible results. But you now have these Ph.D.-level models coming into an enterprise context and showing up for the first day at work. They know nothing about the intricacies of an enterprise, the proprietary data. You spoke about a database. There is nothing represented in the knowledge base of that model. And yes, some of it is emergent, meaning that without really being trained with it, they are reasonably good at doing something with it. But the bigger point being is they get it wrong a lot. So one side, when you ask what Workday is doing, it’s actually taking these models and making them do something valuable in an enterprise context. Just something as simple and it connects to what you just spoke about, making sure you are selecting the right candidates for a job. That is a non-trivial task because you need to understand job requirements, behaviors, and job applications. You need to basically train and specialize a model — and not only a model, actually, a system and a set of models — to do that with high accuracy. Contracts are in many cases using language, terms, and have implications which again are not existing in a public domain. So you have to train a model to basically understand enterprise contracts and apply them in a system like Workday. So I think that’s big. Right now, I’m in San Francisco. We have autonomous cars driving around here. I think that’s an important insight, right? For something to be used in a mission-critical domain, it needs to work all the time. An autonomous car is not viable if it only works 99 percent. Would you use it? I wouldn’t use it. It needs to work 100 percent of the time. There’s a lot of Tesla owners out there who have made a different decision than you. I’m not even going there, right? I know a trick question when I hear it, so I’m not even going there. But for it to work it needs to work 100 percent of the time, and doing this in an enterprise context is heavy lifting. The second thing you said is that of course with AI, behavior changes in helpful and in unhelpful ways. I use AI a lot to do research, and it’s awesome because I have all of this intelligence on tap, and it’s also being used in unhelpful ways, like you’ve said, for creating content spam and unhelpful data signals, which overflow systems. The good thing, though, is that there is always a balance, right? There’s a constant balance between misuse, abuse, and protection. So what is the antidote to what you have just described? It’s that if bots generate applications or forge expense lines and try to trick the expense system, you use AI models to also counter that. As it turns out, AI models are terrific in spotting patterns that are generated versus done from a human. I’m sure you have filled out a CAPTCHA request online in your life, a couple, right? So the same idea. You basically build protection using AI to make sure you’re not being missed or abused by AI. I think that’s all the same meta theme of increasing maturity and using AI systems and working with AI actors both inside and outside of a company. I want to ask you Decoder questions and I want to try to put all this together. You’ve only been at Workday a few months. You probably know where the bathrooms are in the office, I’m hoping, by now. You’ve met all the people. What are you thinking about how your team, the product org, is structured and how you want to change it? That’s an interesting question because you’re actually kind of trying to lead a witness here. Like, “How do you imagine you would change that?” I’m not sure if I am. So Workday is a young company. Workday is 20 years old. Compare this with many other enterprise software companies that are twice as old or even older, right? So Workday has a really strong technology foundation. Actually, what surprised me the most when I got into Workday is how good its technology foundation is. I joined from a cloud provider. I worked at Google for the past four years before I joined Workday. So you come back to the enterprise application domain of certain anticipations and Workday really is incredible when it comes to its tech stack, its scalability, its elasticity. I mean, it was a cloud-first system from the get-go, so it really has a great foundation to stand on. When I think about evolving as going to the future, it pretty much aligns with what you have said. It’s maturing enterprise systems around the use of AI. My take is the following: Today you see a lot of bolt-on AI, meaning you see a lot of legacy systems and they just get an AI overlay, and you see integration vendors deal with all of this complexity, and now AI comes to the scene and they say, “Well, let’s just slap AI over it and we call it automation.” I just want to go back to autonomous cars. If you have AI, the opportunity is to purposefully build with AI to change how a job is done. Where we started actually gets completely innovated and revolutionized. For instance, when we think about something like job applications, something very natural, we all have an understanding. We all applied for jobs. I’m not sure if you did, actually, but I did in my life and I think it resonates. Wait, when you got the job at Workday, did you have to apply in Workday? No, I did not. It’s a good question. No, I did not actually. But Workday is not my first job, right? I was a [junior employee] once, and I put an application into a system and then through the interviewing process. The big opportunity that we have by really innovating in Workday is now taking agentic AI models and not just driving API automation of an old process that was defined by, if you will, human constraints to a new way of doing it with the heavy use of AI. For instance, tailored onboarding experiences, tailored experiences for job applicants and targeting who we approach and how are they feeling for that. You just said, “Why does it matter how I apply to a job, right? I just fill out a form.” But there are industries, for instance, where you have high numbers of frontline workers in retail and hospitality where you have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of applicants a year, and for them actually signing up for a shift or basically joining a company is something that is either frictionless and you can do it through an intelligent experience — including your skill assessment on your mobile phone with a conversation — or you have to log on to a classical web application and fill out forms. I mean, which one would you use? I think there are real opportunities of how we can really change the way these processes are done from what it used to be, which is human- and document-driven, to proactive and AI-led. When you think about those opportunities and how your team is organized, how do you map those things together? How’s your team actually structured? How is Workday structured? We have an AI team today, which is, again, I think a testament to Workday being a young company and being very forward-leaning when it comes to AI. So there is a great AI organization that is part of my product organization, which is basically driving the Workday ML and AI platform. Many of the great things that we are doing in the recruiting space and the contract intelligence space like self-service and agent system of record, this is all being driven by that group. As I’ve indicated, this is one of the key innovation pillars that we have. We have our application domains, right? We have our office of the CHRO, office of finance, our industries, and those are application teams which are basically building on our technology foundation, the AI foundation, our application server, and building the systems that you and I and any listener on this podcast would recognize and say, “Oh that’s Workday,” right. That’s the UI and the workflows around it. And then there’s an infrastructure team, as you would imagine, which is basically running our deployments into the various cloud providers. I mean we are running on AWS and we are running on Google Cloud, and as you can imagine,, this is infrastructure and a pipeline that also needs to be built and maintained. Those in a nutshell are the groups: AI, our applications from HR, finance and industries, and our infrastructure team. Right before you joined, Workday had some big layoffs. I think 1,750 people were let go. Obviously those weren’t your decisions. As you came into the company, did you think, “Oh, I need to hire up,” or was one of the justifications for those cuts that you need to invest more in AI? Tell me about that balance. Did you see, “Okay, we need fewer engineers because the ones we have are using a bunch of AI tools,” or did you see, “We actually need to go hire a bunch of AI engineers?” You’re asking me a question about a time when I wasn’t at Workday, so I can’t really speak to the thinking that went into that decision. I can see, judging from the 60 days or almost 70 days now into my role, that we are actually investing in AI. We are investing across our application suite. I think in a bigger picture, like you have said, yes, the work of software engineering is changing with the use of AI and with the application of AI, meaning that we built skills inside of Workday to effectively use AI and we are hiring for people that bring that expertise into the company, so on both ends. I wouldn’t think, though, that this is in any way different or special from what the overall industry is doing. I mean, we’ve seen so many companies, including companies we have interviewed on the show like Duolingo, say, “Okay, we’re all in on AI. We’re through the testing and experimentation phase. The way we’re running this company is now formally changing because of AI and we expect AI to appear in all the things we do.” Are you all the way there? Yeah, we are making — I hope as any professional software company out there — heavy use of code assistance and wipe coding. And I’ve started my career in software engineering myself, but I was a hands-on developer for many years, and just seeing how much it helps and changes the quality and the results you drive on the software engineering side is amazing. With wipe coding, actually, I think what it drives on the product management side is amazing, that you can actually specify working prototypes and real interactions. It’s not just Figma anymore or a [Product Requirements Document], which is great, right? Because you give so much more fidelity to your ideas. So yes, we make heavy use of that and I truly believe it delivers real returns. Foremost because when I was a developer, I made a fair amount of bugs, meaning introducing issues in the programs that you’ve written. I hope that every software developer out there has the same moral integrity to say, “Bugs happen.” What I saw, and what convinced me the most about assisted coding, is that actually, most of the bugs that you create are in hindsight like, “Yeah, I should have really got that. I just didn’t think the following conditions through.” AI helps in two ways. One is it’s so good at test-case generation that you just have way better verification. And secondly, the assisted coding generates high-quality code, really not making many of the typical mistakes and anti-patterns that you just make as you’re developing from a junior to a very senior software engineer. So we use all of that. That’s super exciting. And yes, Workday has a very powerful concept. It’s called Everyday AI. It was the second thing that surprised me about Workday. And man, Nilay, you’re asking me these questions. I’m not trying to make an advertisement for Workday here, but you’re just asking for it. Workday has this program, Everyday AI, and then when I joined the company, we were having an offsite just in week two, and it was basically a review of Everyday AI, and I was so amazed about how broadly Workday is applying AI. I have talked to so many companies in my past that came to me in my previous role and said, “Well, how do we use AI? What are the use cases? What works?” Then I came to Workday, ranging from employee self-service to contract intelligence in legal, basically both front and back office are making heavy use of AI models, AI applications, and AI systems. I think it was a very smart decision of the company to say, “Let’s experiment very broadly in every function. Let’s find what really delivers value and then quickly double down on those scenarios.” And so I think that Workday is incredibly mature when it comes to applying AI for itself. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is how do you make decisions? What’s your framework? My framework to make decisions? I believe in understanding the details. I think you can ask the question in another way: why do decisions go wrong in the first place? First of all, I think you have to recognize that there is a certain element of uncertainty in every decision that anyone makes. Meaning you can make a really good decision and you can have a bad outcome and you can make a horrible decision and you just get lucky. And that’s the nature of the uncertainty, if you will, of the future, depending on what your belief system is. But I think it’s hard to predict the future and there is always an element of chance and probability. So I think that’s something we have to recognize about it, and that tells us something. That tells us that the one thing I can influence in decision-making actually is having a really robust process that on average, if you will, or in a great end count, produces significantly more good outcomes than bad outcomes. So I’m basically trying to address the uncertainty by having a very robust framework and process to get to a high-quality decision process because I know that statistically that will drive to high-quality decisions in outcome, but you can’t make all of them right. My decision process follows, I think, a simple framework. One is trying to mitigate, as much as possible, human bias. We all have them. They’re so human. It’s funny that I say it that way. There’s so much ingrained in our nature. There is this great book I think by Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow, I’m sure you’ve come across it — that talks about all of the biases that we have and how our brain functions, and there are just some typical repeat patterns. For instance, that we have loss aversion. We think about losses more significantly than potential wins. If I give you $10 and if I then take it away again, you’re not at the same level of happiness as you were. You are unhappy. I made you unhappy, right? Even though you’re exactly the same as when you started, it’s just the loss feels heavier and it biases decision-making. There is a bias in preferences, right? There’s so many things that you can address by, one, having a very structured a decision-making process, going through all of the alternatives, listing them out, writing them down, actually being explicit about them and thinking with pen and paper, if you will, because it helps you to bust all of these biases that you have. And then second of all, in the decision-making process, actually engaging the right set of people to come to an unbiased decision itself, with the right balance of expertise. And thirdly, I think understanding the details matter. The abstractions are helpful, yes, and there is a certain element where it is not adding value anymore to go even deeper. We would all agree you don’t need to understand quantum mechanics to know how to throw a ball, that there are helpful abstractions. But in decision-making on leadership and on businesses, you really do want to go to the right level of detail to truly understand the dynamics of what’s going on. And then there’s being time-bound, right? My father has this great saying that is with me a lot, and he says, “You need to have the courage to take the second-best solution.” And what he means with that is that the most and fiercest competitor that we have in life is status quo. Most of the time we are not taking a decision one way or another. Most of the time we simply decide to not decide and analyze more. Let’s find even more data. Let’s kick the can down the road because you are of the idea that if you just give it more time, you will come to a better solution. And the problem with that is that you are actually passing the point where progress is more important than one percent more accuracy in the decision that you take. So if you put those four things together, having a really good decision framework that goes against or insulates you from your own biases. Secondly, having the right mixture of experts around you to make sure you are really having the key voices representative. Thirdly, understanding the details so you can make an informed decision, and then when the clock runs out, you go. You need to have the courage for the second-best solution sometimes. Let’s put this into practice. Workday, like all enterprise software, suffers from a disconnect between the customer and the user. You see this in every enterprise. Every piece of enterprise software has this problem. It’s CIOs and CEOs and COOs who buy this stuff and there are employees who use it, and that means there’s not a great feedback loop between the experiences of the people using the software and the people who are spending money on it, and that means the software is all bad. Like, broadly. We don’t use Workday here, we use UKG Pro. I think UKG Pro is bad. I’ll just name all your competitors down the line. The users think the software is bad. Workday has a particular reputation here. Business Insider literally published a piece in 2024 called “Everyone hates Workday” and the quotes are brutal. Here’s one from an AI company, a copy director at an AI company. The quote is, “Using Workday is like constantly being botsmacked by bureaucracy incarnate. Getting somebody onboarded, using Workday is like trying to get water from your sink to your stove using a colander.” That’s bad. Using a what? Using a colander, like a strainer. Okay. You’re trying to carry water with a bucket with holes in it. You see this everywhere. The interface as expressed is bad. People do not like using the software. There’s another quote from that same piece: “Everything is so non-intuitive. Even the simplest tasks leave me scratching my head.” There’s one that says, “I just hate the software.” Great. That’s every piece of enterprise software. But Workday in particular has this headline, this reputation. You can see it on Reddit. You can see it in the comments of the training videos I was watching on YouTube. How do you fix that problem? I think a part of that is really understanding what you just articulated. As I said, understand the details, right? Understand, truly, the details to make sure you are making good decisions specifically about what you invest time in and what you think generates value for the users of Workday? So when we say, “Understand the details,” I think it’s really important in enterprise software to go through the workflows in detail and sometimes for yourself, sometimes by observation, sometimes by interview, and really have firsthand experience about what it is that people do and how does it feel and what makes it good and what can be improved upon it. I think to your point, it sounds so benign, but you said let’s apply this framework, right? The framework simply states that, “Well, do you understand the problem really when someone is saying this is great or someone is saying this is bad? What do they truly mean?” Because we all have our biases, right? For instance, one big bias is you seek validation, right? You seek validation for what you believe to be true, and you overemphasize on signals that reinforce that. The first step is really going to the right level of detail and understanding what it is at the action level that drives satisfaction or dissatisfaction in a piece of your application experience. Once you have that, once you understand that, it turns out that usually the framework becomes almost obvious to say, “Well, this is something that ideally should be different,” or, “This is something that actually works the way it’s supposed to.” It’s just not communicated. It’s miscommunicated, right? You are holding it wrong. That’s quite a quote. Yeah, that category exists, believe it or not. Or thirdly, “Hey, actually we have different ways or different expectations now of how you can use that.” For instance, when you talk about system interactions, right, the reality is that it’s a dynamic environment. I have two kids. They have different expectations of using a system than what I had. I grew up with forms, that was computer stuff, right? How cool is that? That’s amazing. My daughter is mobile-first and, dare I say now, AI-first, and she’s just eight years old. So that’s the amazing part of it, a different intuition. So when I say Workday and AI specifically, it’s now, “Hey, how can we make this conversational?“ or, “How can we make it so you don’t even have to specify some of this information anymore?” Like you said, I have to take information from here to there. Why is this complex? Why do you even have to? Is an AI model maybe proficient, and can we make it proficient so it just automates that? This is why I wanted to start with talking about what the software actually is. When I see a quote that says, “This software is bureaucracy incarnate,” what I imagine that means is a bunch of people at a company had a bunch of priorities and they all got expressed in a form. Everybody wants another piece of data from whatever process is happening and we’re just going to put another field in the form and then everyone can get their data, and that’s your “bureaucracy incarnate,” right? We’re literally shipping the org chart in the nature of this process. Okay, so now we’re going to say AI is going to fix it. We’re going to fill in all the forms as fast as possible just by talking, and all the forms get filled out, and then that looks like a risk. Like there you have exactly the risk. Maybe the AI is just going to say 20 percent nicer things because the model’s wrong because ChatGPT 4.0 got a little too nice one day. Maybe it’s just going to make some stuff up because it thinks that’s what you want to hear. Maybe it’s going to mishear the person. I hear a lot from a lot of companies that AI is the new user interface, all the way down to Eddy Cue on the stand in the Google trial yesterday, who said maybe 10 years from now you won’t even have an iPhone because AI will have replaced it all. That’s where we are as an industry. And then I look at this very simple problem for a lot of people filling out a database on Workday. Filling out the database for the AI might mean the database is full of bad information, but no one else has solved the problem in any other way. I think it really connects to where we started, the whole question of what drives value with AI. I fundamentally believe with AI, as with any other technology, you can apply it superficially or you can apply it in an excellent way. And applying AI in an excellent way actually means getting AI to differentiated levels of accuracy and outcomes. We talked about autonomous cars and you said some work and some don’t, right? So there’s clearly a difference, right? Even though you could all say, “Well, I’m sure they make all use of AI somewhere somehow to do processing and trajectory projection and so forth.” And that’s exactly what we are focusing on with Workday, because some of the information, like you have said, is important information, right? Guess what? You want to pay people. You want to have internal mobility. We have, in companies, in many companies today, a shortage of qualified labor for the work that they want to get done, and they have people sometimes inside the company who could do it or even people outside of the company that they could activate for doing it, just to pick a very simple example. And now the question is, what can you do by excellently applying AI to really revolutionize and improve these journeys? And there are clearly ways to do that. I was just speaking about recruiting, but you can help recruiters make better decisions. They don’t have to fill in the form anymore. They don’t have to make the assessment. The model helps them to identify the right candidate for the greater good of everyone. Well, let me ask you about that. You inherit literally the biases of the models, right? You inherit literally the capabilities of the model. Right now there’s a lawsuit against Workday saying that the tools are biased against workers and applicants, particularly Black workers and applicants over the age of 40. That might be the problem in the model, that might be the problem in how you’ve expressed the model, it might just be how people are using the model. But now you’re saying you’re going to help make these decisions and you have this liability. How do you fix that? First of all, I cannot possibly comment on any ongoing lawsuit, but in general– But the lawsuit exists, right? You know it exists. This is the problem in depending on the AI. The AI might make errors of this magnitude. I will give you Gerrit’s opinion. So because again, and you know this, if you want to have commentary on the ongoing case, you have to talk to the right person for it. That’s not who I am. But I can speak to you in general about AI. I think AI actually helps us to become unbiased, and the same principle applies, right? You can apply AI very poorly, and it’s a question of maturity. Since the course of the existence of machine learning, people learn that if you have the wrong training data and you’re lacking guardrails, the model just expresses what was given [to] the model during its training phase. Basically, you define it by the act of creating it. And as you move from immature AI to excellent AI, when we understand the representation of data, the guardrails that we have to put around it, I think all of these biases, as you described — that humans are susceptible too, just in a different way. But humans have emotions, humans have irrational elements to them. We are not computers. And that is what makes humans great, but it also makes us, in many cases, poor decision-makers. But the AIs… the corpus of their training material is biased human information. Yeah, exactly. How do you take that and then turn that into a thing that unbiases us? Especially in these contexts. I mean, Amazon had to stop using AI screening tools that were imposing bias into their hiring process. Can you measure it? Can you say, “Okay, we’re good enough”? You do it by getting the recipe right, meaning you’re getting the training recipe right, you’re getting the guardrails right, and I think this is the important intersectionally that in order to get AI right, you have to look at it holistically. You have to understand the domain. You have to understand what is the judgment that a model applies. You have to understand what training data you need to provide for it, and you need to provide the guardrails that you have to basically put as checks and balances around it so it stays in its defined parameters. Once you do that — and that’s the power of AI and machine learning models — they will consistently work at the same level of quality, but it’s the responsibility to create that system around it. I think — again, my opinion — if you do that, it works in an incredibly powerful way. Let’s just go back to something we all experience in San Francisco every day: autonomous cars. That’s a great example, because so many things can go wrong, and now we are at the stage where they work reliably. And the lesson is, if you design a system the right way, if you think about it holistically, you can actually make it work all the time, better than a human driver would, because we also have human limitations that we don’t want passed on. What is every good recruiting team doing? What is every good performance review team doing at the beginning of a review session? Let’s unbias ourselves, right? Let’s talk about them so we free ourselves from that being applied. And there are teams that are good at it. There are teams that are not as good at it. But if you codify it in a system, you can basically have the best-possible decision-making on tap every day, and that’s the power of it. Tekedra Mawakana, the CEO of Waymo, has been on the show, and the thing that struck me was that it’s true, it does work great in San Francisco, I think in Austin and Phoenix now, too. It’s rolling out. All warm weather cities. I asked her, “Will this thing work in Denver?” And she was like, “No, no, no, no, no. Too hilly. Too snowy. Can’t do it.” That’s what I mean. We’ve designed systems in very narrow domains under essentially perfect conditions that we trust, and then you make it more complex and then it’s just like no, we can’t do it yet. Maybe we’ll get there one day, but we can’t do it yet. I think you’re completely right, and that’s exactly what I mean. You make it work by narrowing the domain. It’s incredibly hard to make a car work everywhere. It’s incredibly difficult to make a general AI that works on everything. And again, that’s the Workday recipe. Our claim is not that we are going to make an artificial general intelligence that solves any problem. We do exactly what you said. It’s narrowing down the domain to something that we really understand, that we understand perfectly, and let’s design a system that basically solves that part of the enterprise ecosystem. When you think about the complaints people have for Workday today, I want to ask you two different questions. One, what are the top five ones that you want to fix? People do not like using this software. How would you fix it for them today? That seems to be a really important point for you, Nilay. As I said, you were brave. This is why enterprise executives don’t come on the show, because that’s honestly what the listeners want me to ask. How are you going to fix my problems today? It’s not just feature requests, it’s the holistic experience of using enterprise software that is bad. How would you fix it today? I think my conviction… down to the bones of my body if you will, I’m a product person. I love well-designed products and I seek them out for myself and I aspire to build them. I think when we say about building a product — and I was talking earlier like, are you holding it the right way? — beautiful design is how it works. It’s not just how it looks. Design is how it works in everyday use, from a coffee machine to an enterprise software system, and I think the recipe is for all of them the same. Recognizing that this is a big deal. This is not something that just falls off at the end. That’s something you have to carefully research, design, and invest for to make it work. And then secondly, when you asked me about my decision-making process, really understanding those details, what works well and what doesn’t. If something doesn’t work well, what’s the best way to improve it and to make a tangible improvement for the ones who are articulating the need for improvement. I believe honestly in a relentless pursuit of the basics. When we say excellence, how do you get excellence in anything? I think it’s to recognize the importance every day. Secondly, apply the discipline rigorously every morning, every afternoon before you go to bed. And if you do this consistently enough over a period of time, you will see huge differences. The problem with all of these things is you cannot go from here to there in a step function, change from here to tomorrow, right? Because actually what you’re saying is, “How do you achieve excellence in something which is non-trivial?” And as I said, first of all, it’s fully believing in its value, otherwise you won’t have the strength to see it through, and then secondly, applying the basics of that discipline every single day, rigorously, and over a period of time, and you will see amazing returns. I said I was going to ask this question two ways, so here’s the second way. Do you use Workday at Workday? Yes, we’re using Workday at Workday. What are the five things that bother you most about using Workday at your job? Can I tell you what the biggest surprise was, first of all, when I came to Workday? I have used Workday before. Sure. [Laughs] The Workday at Workday looks so different. [Laughs] I mean, this is one of the issues, right, because your customers deploy it differently. Exactly. And I was coming into Workday and I said, “I’m surprised,” because the system that I have just used for everything, from entire onboarding, from benefits enrollment, to corporate credit card, to learning my team, to any sort of approvals, to org review, I’ve done it all in Workday. Everything, and it is so different. And so I said “Explain this to me.” Because honestly, in my previous Workday experience, I had struggled with a couple of things here. This is different. And I was told basically what you said: “Yeah, it’s a real issue that we have customers who configure and deploy the system and are not updating the system to any of the improvements we have done over the recent past.” So when you asked what I wanted to change immediately? I want to go on a campaign and actually make sure that the quality of the experience — and I’m not saying there is nothing to be improved anymore — but the many, many things that I have experienced firsthand myself are 10 times better from what I personally have seen before. Making sure that all of this flows for the users. What are some of those things? Be specific. Search. Find me my form for requesting a credit card, searching “credit card,” and getting the form loaded and populated with the right fields already, because, guess what, you know my name, right? There is no surprise here. And my employee ID and all of that. And just making me basically select the credit card example, what is the limit, and if I want express delivery and send. Something like that. So search experience, one terrific example, or the assistant experience, one of the workflows that people most do commonly is request personal time off. In Workday Everywhere, you can do this by using Slack or Teams, right, with a chatbot. So I bet many of the things that you were quoting are people trying to do something that to them looks very simplistic: “I just want to know my PTO balance and put in a request. Why do we even have to log on to that system?” So that’s what I mean when I talk about a difference in expectations, that you just expect it to happen in your collaboration suite. Well, with Workday Everywhere, that works and I was surprised. Before you ask, I didn’t request PTO in my first 60 days, but I was trying it out, okay, because I wanted to know, because I believe in understanding the details. So as said, one of the things I want to do first is making sure all of this flows through to everyone because I think there is so much goodness that people are not yet getting. You’re hinting at something here, and this’ll be the last question because it’s just a big idea that I keep coming back to in all these conversations about AI and software and how we use it, that eventually the interface will just be natural language, right? There’s the small step you’re talking about, which is to go to the customers and help them deploy Workday more beautifully and make it make more sense for people and use all the tools. And then there’s the big one, which is you’re just going to talk to it and it’s going to do some stuff. How far away do you think we are from that? I think there are a whole lot of tasks where people use forms to approximate conversations where conversation is clearly a better paradigm, like a self-service type of request. Like I said, PTO and PTO balance. This is more like a self-service scenario where I can easily specify and it’s automating that and conversation is a good way of exposing it. And there are some others that fall in the same category, but turns out there are many that are not. So like I said, how many things can you remember in a conversation, off top of your head? Probably seven concepts max at a time. There are some application domains where you have a way more complex context and state models right there. Just something as simplistically as could you design a 3D scene without seeing it just through conversation? Of course not. Would you want to specify verbally that you want to select an element in the fourth layer? Probably not, right? It’s way too complex. Pointing and clicking is way more efficient. So I argue the case that conversational models will be a key part of what everyday experience is for a certain set of problems that just very nicely fit into it, and there is a larger set of problems, they are the state model, and the contexts are so dense that you cannot possibly conceive them in a conversational thread because it’s just overlaying what you can memorize in your brain. So I think it’s going to be on both ends, but I think every scenario where you’re going to ask something — “Can you do this for me? Can you find that information for me?” — it’s more simplistic in terms of the information retrieval, which is a great example of that, by the way. I think that’s going to be completely replaced with a conversational interface because why not? Essentially you have a request-response paradigm with some refinement in the middle for which a conversation turns out to be the best way of facilitating that. One of the reasons I asked this question is because my favorite Slack room at our company is called “finance-support,” and it’s staffed mostly by bots, and the people who are new to it come in and they ask very nice questions in full sentences, and the people who use it every day just shout nouns into the void. I’m looking at it right now — it just says, there’s someone who just says, “Extra April expenses.” One person literally just typed the word “credit card,” and then entered into an entire flow with this bot. It’s basically a command line and we’ve just recapitulated the command line with a more conversational interface where people have realized that the keywords will just do the job. Is that where we’re headed? We’re just doing command line? I don’t think so, but I do think what you’re describing actually is a good thing. I heard that OpenAI is using a lot of inference cycles because people are just being polite to the model, saying “thank you” and “please.” But the model’s going to work for that. So what you’re describing I think is just an amazing efficiency that people understand, “Hey, I don’t have to write a fully specified sentence of punctuation. I can just keyword it in and the system is going to do it for me.” And I think it’s because for some of the work this is just very efficient. Like are you really typing a full URL in your browser and writing it full out? I don’t. I rely on autocomplete and search to do the job for me. That’s a perfectly fine way of accomplishing the job. But I do think, like I’ve said, there are a certain set of problems like information retrieval and simple workflows where this is just a very nice way of doing it. That command line is good for a reason, to your point. An intelligent command line is very powerful. But there’s a bigger set of tasks and jobs where you wouldn’t use a command line. You need to see what you’re dealing with. You have many elements that are in relationship with each other. Just take something as simplistic as a contract in finance, because you just said finance, and you have a context with multiple payment terms that are dependent on each other. So you do need to see those pieces and how they interact with each other to make sense out of them. And AI is going to help you in identifying them and telling you, “This is a red line in a contract that you have to pay attention to. This is a payment term that you may want to leverage.” But if you want to modify that contract, if you want to rearrange it, you want to see the piece that you’re working with, right? You have this across so many domains that I think AI is going to change UI, and we have UIs that are designed with AI in mind. Today, some vendors are telling you you’re going to have a chatbot and a workflow engine and that’s going to be great, and that’s a good story to tell because we have all of this stuff built and having a chatbot over it doesn’t hurt, for sure, but it’s not going to change how you run as a company. It’s not going to be a transformative outcome for you. But if you design applications with AI collaboration in mind from the get-go — payroll, benefit selection, if you want to elect your benefits, you may want to see options. You may want to have multiple options compared to each other. There are going to be things where we can decide whether we’re going to render UIs into chatbots or render AI next to UIs, but it’s not going to lose those elements of interactivity where you just need to break beyond textual input and output. Gerrit, I feel like we could talk about the future of AI and how it changes workplace interface forever. I have to say, by the way, thank you. It is true — not many enterprise executives are brave enough to come on the show and answer the questions. So I appreciate it. Thank you so much for being on Decoder. Thank you for having me, Nilay.

Title: Media CEO Pay Packages in 2024: The Air Up There
URL: https://variety.com/lists/media-ceo-salaries-compensation-pay-packages-2024/
Time Published: 2025-05-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Top execs kept raking in the bucks last year, even as many of the companies they led struggled to stay aloft The entertainment business has seen better days. Film and TV production in the U.S. rose 18% last year but lagged 2022 levels, according to ProPro, which tracks studio productions. Theatrical ticket sales fell 3.3% in 2024 and remain nearly 25% down from pre-pandemic levels. Media conglomerates are spinning off cable channels at a dizzying rate, an acknowledgment of the damage that streaming has done to that cash cow. And tech giants like Amazon and Apple, which elbowed into the content business a few years ago, have found that it’s much harder to make a show that people care about than it is to sell them paper towels and iPhones. Cutbacks and layoffs are the order of the day. Yet for some reason the spirit of economizing didn’t extend to the executive suites. Seven of the 10 CEOs and media barons whose pay packages we examine as part of our annual survey of compensation got raises. And in most cases, the bumps were double-digit ones even though their results were often lackluster at best. “When the stock is up, CEOs always take credit, but when it plunges, they rarely take responsibility,” says Charles Elson of the University of Delaware’s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “There should be more alignment between pay packages and performance so when there’s a bad year, the CEOs take more of a hit.” To be fair, some of these executives will end up banking far less than what’s reported. That’s because the stock awards and options represent fair value as of the grant date and do not reflect actual dollar amounts received by executives. If the company’s value shrinks, so does their compensation. Of course, if it increases, their windfall could be even greater than it initially appeared in public filings. The pay packages may be largely undiminished, but our list of top executives shrank. Paramount Global hoped to have finalized its sale to Skydance Media by now, but the Trump administration and the president’s lawsuit against “60 Minutes” appears to be holding up regulatory approval. Still, Bob Bakish, who left Paramount amid the company’s deal talks with Skydance, has already profited handsomely, earning $87 million last year, which includes $69.3 million in severance. Then there’s Endeavor, which went private again after four years as a publicly traded company. Ari Emanuel, the brash agent who led the company’s whipsaw transformation, got a $173.8 million cash payout from the equity he converted to cash as part of the go-private deal (while also rolling his ownership interests with a total value of $290.3 million into the newly private company, Endeavor Group Holdings). Paramount Global will likely soon have company, as most industry observers expect that other media companies are looking for buyers (speculation often centers on Warner Bros. Discovery, which has endured two traumatic mergers over the past seven years and formally separated its TV business from its studio and streaming operations). Experts like Elson say companies often have good reasons for selling themselves or acquiring each other. But he also notes that there’s often a strong financial incentive for the people at the top to make these kinds of deals. “The synergies that come with a merger can be quite helpful, but you have to make sure the cost savings are really there,” he says. “Sometimes these deals are more ego driven and turn out to be disasters.” Historically, media chieftains are far better compensated than leaders in other industries. Much of that has to do with the ownership structure of entertainment conglomerates such as Comcast and Fox, which have dual-class stock. That gives the families behind them much tighter control, enabling them to reward themselves without risking much interference from average shareholders. This, in turn, skews the pay packages of media companies like Disney and Netflix, which aren’t run by families but justify rewarding their executives with big bonuses and options because they are part of the same peer group. It helps that the boards of these companies are often loaded with sympathetic allies. “Board members themselves are well paid,” says Rosanna Landis Weaver of shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. “It’s a very cushy gig. And no board member ever got asked to leave for saying, ‘Let’s pay the CEO more.’” Running a media company requires a very particular set of skills. A successful CEO must be the public face of a corporation — telegenic, amiable, able to work a room — and also serve as an ambassador to Wall Street at a time when investors have grown more skeptical about the long-term health of the entertainment business. Just look how difficult it was for Bob Chapek, the short-lived CEO of Disney, whose tenure was so rocky that the company reenlisted Bob Iger, the man he succeeded, as his replacement. But if media conglomerates rationalize giving their leaders extravagant pay packages because they’re worried that another company is going to poach them or that they will leave of their own volition, they should probably think again. “The thing about the media business is that these jobs are fun,” says David L. Yermack, professor of finance at NYU. “You get to have a lot of influence on society, and shaping culture is interesting work. Running a coal mine or being in the utilities business isn’t anywhere near as interesting.” Bob Iger, CEO2024 compensation: $41.4M/+31%Median employee compensation: $55,111Iger pay ratio to median employee: 746 How do you determine a job well done? When it came to Iger’s $7.2 million bonus, Disney’s board gave him credit for releasing “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which the family-friendly brand enthused was “the highest grossing R-rated film ever,” as well as for presiding over the best-attended D23 event in history and leading a company dubbed one of America’s most trusted by no less an authority than Newsweek. It’s hardly an empirical assessment, but Iger did have a successful 2024, one that saw the studio topping its rivals at the box office and releasing streaming hits like “Shōgun.” For Iger’s efforts, his relatively modest $1 million salary got augmented by more than $30 million in stock options and awards, as well as $523,685 in personal air travel and $1.4 million in security. It pays to rule the Magic Kingdom. Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO2024 compensation: $61.9M/+24.3% Greg Peters, Co-CEO2024 compensation: $60.3M/+50.2% Median employee compensation: $215,503Sarandos/Peters pay ratio to median employee: 287/280 Bingeing has been very good to Netflix’s co-leaders. Last year, the company targeted $40 million in total compensation apiece. Both got more than 50% of that, thanks to the streamer’s stellar performance. The company ended 2024 with 301.6 million subscribers (up 16%) and generated operating income of more than $10 billion. The stock soared 89% for the year, dispelling any doubts about the unusual two-in-a-box leadership structure. For 2024, Sarandos and Peters each received a $12 million cash bonus plus stock valued at $42.7 million, with Netflix’s compensation committee citing “our outstanding relative stock price performance compared to constituents of the S&P 500.” Meanwhile, co-founder and chairman Reed Hastings’ pay package dropped to $1.75 million last year (from $11.3 million in 2023). Don’t pass the hat for Hastings — he owned 4.23 million Netflix shares as of early April. David Zaslav, CEO and president2024 compensation: $51.9M/+4.4%Median employee compensation: $130,316Zaslav pay ratio to median employee: 398 Few would point to the marriage of Warner Bros. and Discovery and declare it a glittering success. The media conglomerate’s market cap hovers at $22 billion, roughly half of where it stood in 2022 when the companies joined forces. Like many entertainment giants, Warner Bros. Discovery has struggled to manage the contraction of the theatrical movie business and the collapse of cable, its primary source of revenue. Yet Zaslav, the main architect of the merger, is still rewarded handsomely. His $51.9 million compensation package includes a $23.9 million bonus (more than 100% of the target amount), as well as a $3 million base salary, another $23 million in stock awards, a $17,446 car allowance and 250 hours of personal flight time each year on the corporate jet. Brian Roberts, CEO and chairman2024 compensation: $33.9M/-4.5% Michael Cavanagh, President2024 compensation: $28.25M/-4.5% Median employee compensation: $89,237Roberts pay ratio to median employee: 380 Roberts and chief lieutenant Cavanagh got big bonuses last year — just not as fat as they were in 2023. Comcast grew on the top and bottom lines in 2024, while free cash flow (a component used to determine executive compensation) declined 3.8% to $12.5 billion. The board’s compensation committee determined that the company’s top execs were entitled to cash bonuses equivalent to 109% of target. But both Roberts and Cavanagh “requested that they not receive more than 100% of their target bonuses,” according to Comcast’s proxy filing, settling for $7.5 million. In discussing their performance, the company cited the plan led by the pair to spin off NBCUniversal’s cable TV networks (excluding Bravo) and complementary digital assets. The new public company, Versant, is set to separate from its parent by the end of 2025. Lachlan Murdoch, CEO and executive chair2024 compensation: $23.8M/+9.3% Rupert Murdoch, Chairman emeritus2024 compensation: $21.2M/-7.7% Median employee compensation: $89,068Lachlan Murdoch pay ratio to median employee: 267 Rupert Murdoch, 94, officially retired in November 2023. But the TV news, sports and entertainment company he built continued to pay him generously. As chairman emeritus, he had a compensation package totaling $21.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 2024, which included $8.6 million worth of stock and options and a $2.3 million bonus “following 71 years of service to the company,” per Fox Corp.’s annual proxy filing. Eldest son Lachlan Murdoch, who now runs the media empire, saw his pay climb 9.3% largely thanks to a $6 million cash bonus (versus $4.5 million in fiscal 2023) based on “quantitative” and “qualitative” performance factors evaluated by the board. “Fox once again delivered strong operational and financial results in fiscal 2024,” the company said in its proxy filing, including Fox News ending the period as the No. 1 cable network among total viewers for the eighth straight year. Tim Cook, CEO2024 compensation: $74.6M/+18%Median employee compensation: $114,738Cook pay ratio to median employee: 650 After docking Cook’s stock incentives in 2023, Apple determined that it wasn’t paying him enough. Based on an analysis of CEO compensation at “peer companies” including Amazon, Disney and Netflix, the tech giant boosted the target value of Cook’s equity award for fiscal 2024 from $40 million to $50 million. Cook’s stock grants were calculated to be worth $58 million. To be sure, the tech giant kept minting money: Apple revenue hit a record $391 billion (up 2%) for the fiscal year ended September 2024, while net income declined 3% to (only!) $93.7 billion. Of note: Apple’s services biz, which includes the App Store and Apple TV+, generated $96 billion for the year, up nearly 13%. In justifying Cook’s enlarged stock grant, the board’s compensation committee cited “the impact his leadership has on the company’s short-term and long-term success.” Andy Jassy, CEO2024 compensation: $1.6M/+17.6%Median employee compensation: $37,181Jassy pay ratio to median employee: 43 Don’t be fooled: Jassy earns more for running the e-commerce mega-company than the number listed for his 2024 compensation on Amazon’s proxy statement. As reported under SEC rules, the CEO was paid $1.6 million last year. But the bulk of Jassy’s remuneration is in stock awards that vest over several years (which Amazon reported as compensation for 2021). According to Amazon, Jassy’s 2024 “realized compensation” increased by 37%, to $40.1 million, due to the company’s stock price gains. That came after his realized comp decreased by 12% in 2023. In his April 10 annual letter to shareholders, Jassy touted the company’s growing entertainment lineup, including originals like “Reacher,” “Fallout,” “The Boys” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” and live sports like the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” — with the NBA and Nascar coming later this year.

May 15, 2025 09:25 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that the Elevance Health class action lawsuit – captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., No. 25-cv-00923 (S.D. Ind.) – seeks to represent purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock and charges Elevance Health and certain of Elevance Health’s executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-elevance-health-inc-class-action-lawsuit-elv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Elevance Health class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 11, 2025. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Elevance Health operates as a health benefits company. Among other things, the cost of providing health benefits to members is driven by the level of care a patient requires, often referred to as “acuity,” and the members’ utilization of the health benefits, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Medicaid redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance Health’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs; and (ii) this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance Health’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 17, 2024, Elevance Health revealed that it was now “expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint. Then, on October 17, 2024, the Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that Elevance Health announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that Elevance Health had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance Health further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 11%. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Elevance Health common stock during the class period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit.

Title: Walmart’s tariff price hikes are likely weeks away

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Walmart said in February that it wasn’t “immune” from the costs of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Now it’s preparing shoppers to pay more, potentially within weeks. The retail giant is likely to start rolling out tariff-related price hikes “towards the tail end of this month, and I certainly expect more in June,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC on Thursday, as the company reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Sales rose by 4.5% at U.S. stores, and the company’s e-commerce business notched its first profitable quarter. Walmart is the nation’s largest private-sector employer, with a 1.6 million-strong U.S. workforce and 4,700 locations, which it says are within 10 miles of 90% of the population. The company pulled in $165.6 billion in revenue in the first quarter. It’s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now. Walmart Chief Financial officer John David Rainey But despite Walmart’s huge footprint at the center of the consumer economy, Rainey said “it’s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now,” speaking separately Thursday to Bloomberg. He indicated the Trump administration has further to go to resolve cost pressures that have risen at a scale and speed without “historical precedent,” echoing analysts on the heels of recent truces with the U.K. and China. Walmart’s stock was trading about 3.6% lower Thursday morning following its earnings report. Since Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs on April 2 — then partially walked them back days later — its shares have risen 3.4%, outpacing the gains of Target and Costco, and remain up 2.9% since the start of the year. CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that Trump’s 145% tariffs on China have had “the biggest impact” on the many toys and electronics Walmart sources there. He thanked the president for recent “progress” after the U.S. agreed to lower its effective tariff rate on China to 30% for a few months. “We’re hopeful that it leads to a longer-term agreement” and lower duties, he said. Rainey added on the investor call that many tariffs remain too high. Duties that in some cases are “approaching 50% for other countries is not a good outcome for retailers, not a good outcome for the economy,” he said. “Real prosperity is American workers being able to support their families and communities because they have good jobs that pay well and provide dignity,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. These goals matter more than “cheap Chinese toys,” he said, and pointed to cooler wholesale and consumer inflation data for April released this week. Walmart is feeling pressure to raise prices on bananas, avocados, coffee and roses due to tariffs on Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia, McMillon said. He promised the retailer would “do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible.” That could include absorbing higher prices and opting to “not simply pass on a tariff cost attributable to each item individually,” McMillon said. “We also have suppliers shifting materials from tariff-impacted components like aluminum to fiberglass, where there is no tariff. Our merchants, sourcing team and suppliers are being creative.” Walmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases. Neil Saunders, managing director, globaldata Large companies typically have the most leeway to make adjustments like these. For many smaller operators, tariffs pose an existential threat that could allow big corporate rivals to expand their market shares, as the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce and independent shop owners themselves have warned. “If Walmart’s coming out — with its scale and its buying power and its focus — and saying prices are going to rise, everyone else is going to have to follow suit,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy GlobalData. “Walmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases.” Already, a number of companies that sell products at Walmart, such as Stanley Black & Decker, Adidas, Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have raised prices or signaled expected hikes. “Should the duties go away, there will of course not be price increases,” Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said in late April. “Should this duty stay or even be higher, then of course it will cause a price increase in the market in general.” Saunders said he expects grocery prices across the retail industry to rise 3% to 5% by the end of this year, while merchandise more dependent on global sourcing could jump by 5% to 7%. “It’s not just the odd 1% that people can almost absorb and ignore,” he said. “We’re looking at reasonably substantial inflation.” Other big-box retailers, including Home Depot, Lowes, Target and BJ’s Wholesale, are set to report first-quarter earnings next week. Several major consumer brands have already revised or scrapped their financial outlooks for the rest of the year, struggling to game out how ever-shifting trade policies will affect them. Walmart, for its part, maintained its 2025 sales and profit guidance. But it decided not to offer guidance on operating income or earnings per share for the second quarter now underway, due to “the range of near-term outcomes being exceedingly wide and difficult to predict.” Nationwide, retail sales rose just 0.1% in April, down sharply from a revised 1.7% increase in March, new federal data showed Thursday. Last month’s level was in line with analysts’ expectations but reflects consumers tightening their belts after a buying spree in which many scooped up products before more tariffs hit. Walmart said Thursday that it brought in new customers last month and saw growth among shoppers of all income levels. “They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases,” Rainey told CNBC. But so far, “their behaviors largely have not changed,” he said. “They’re still looking for value.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. J.J.

Title: What’s Happening With CoreWeave Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A laptop keyboard and CoreWeave logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo ... More taken in Krakow, Poland on March 28, 2025. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), an AI infrastructure provider, recently announced its Q1 results, reporting a loss of $1.49 per share on revenue of $982 million. This exceeded market expectations of $853 million in revenue. However, its capital expenditures plan of $20-23 billion was much higher than the $18 billion anticipated by the analysts and it didn’t sit well with investors - triggering a decline in the stock in after-hours trading. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? Since its IPO at $40 per share in March, CRWV stock has surged past $65 earlier this week, significantly outperforming the NASDAQ index’s 11% gain over the same period. CoreWeave’s strong backlog of over $25 billion has contributed to its stock’s impressive performance. However, if you prefer a less volatile investment alternative, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outpaced the S&P 500 and has delivered over 91% returns since inception. CoreWeave’s Q1 revenue of $982 million reflects an impressive 420% year-over-year increase. CoreWeave has secured significant contracts with leading AI labs, hyperscalers, and enterprises, including OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, Meta, and Mistral AI, aiding its revenue growth. The first quarter also saw OpenAI solidify its relationship with CoreWeave by committing to a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion. This significant agreement underscores the growing importance of CoreWeave’s infrastructure for OpenAI. Additionally, CoreWeave’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 700 bps to 62%, up from 55% in the previous year’s quarter. However, the adjusted net loss widened to $150 million from $24 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenue offset by a contraction in net margin resulted in adjusted net loss of $0.61 per share. Looking ahead, CoreWeave expects Q2’25 revenue of $1.08 billion and full-year 2025 revenue of $5.0 billion, at the mid-point of the provided range. This fares better than the consensus estimates of $987 million and $4.6 billion, respectively. CRWV stock has shown some volatility since its debut. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, is significantly more stable. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? This portfolio comprises stocks that have historically provided stronger returns with lower risk compared to the broader index, offering a more predictable performance, as evident in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and ongoing trade disputes, could CoreWeave sustain its upward trajectory? Since the stock was only listed last year, there is no historical data to assess its historical valuation multiple. At its current price of approximately $63 (after market hours), CRWV trades at 13 times trailing revenue. With sales increasing by over 700% in 2024, over 400% in Q1, and it’s expected to grow 2.3x this year, the company’s high valuation multiple appears justified. However, the company’s high capital expenditures and widening losses remain key near-term concerns.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Retail Shift to Riskier Tokens Jolts Bitcoin, Ether

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The cryptocurrency market pulled back over the last 24 hours, led by declines in major coins as retail investors switched out of large-cap tokens and into smaller, more speculative assets. Both bitcoin BTC$105,724.14 and ether ETH$2,462.74 dropped around 2% and the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broad market, fell 2.7%. "We’ve observed a significant week-on-week increase in retail participation, reinforcing the broader narrative of rising optimism," said Jake O., an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute. “The shift down the risk curve is most evident in retail screen flows.” Institutional investors, for their part, have been more conservative. They're still stocking up on bitcoin, ether and XRP$2.32, while easing off positions in solana SOL$165.56 which has faced “sustained pressures.” “Some are viewing SOLETH underperformance as an opportunity to position for Solana topside,” Jake noted, pointing to steady buying in $200 Solana call options ahead of June and July. Other options activity suggests traders are hedging for volatility ahead. Call spreads on ether were unwound and some traders moved into collar structures — strategies often used to protect against price swings — signaling caution after recent gains. The growing hedging activity adds a note of caution to retail's swing to speculation. Economic uncertainty, lingering inflation pressures and U.S. tariff policy are all weighing on risk appetite in crypto as well as traditional markets. Global asset managers, in fact, currently have their largest underweight position in the U.S. dollar in 19 years. Even though President Donald Trump secured a major investment deal with Qatar and a temporary reduction in U.S.-China tariffs, these outcomes may lead to further downside: Spanish bank Bankinter said in a note that the market has shown fatigue over the last trading session. “We still think the damage is done: both EPS and prices should feel the strain, with rising inflationary pressures preventing the Fed from cutting rates as much as the market expects,” the bank’s analysts wrote. Market participants are set to now focus on producer price inflation and retail sales data, as well as on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech later today. For the crypto market, a re-test of the all-time high isn’t out of the picture. “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on 19 May draws closer,” Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote.

Title: What's Next For AMD Stock After Recent 20% Gain
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/15/whats-next-for-amd-stock-after-recent-20-gain/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GERMANY - 2025/04/06: In this photo illustration, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. logo is seen displayed ... More on a monitor. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) increased by more than 4% during Tuesday's trading session and has risen by nearly 20% over the last month. What factors are contributing to the stock's upward trend? Tuesday saw AMD unveil a $10 billion agreement with Humain, a startup based in Saudi Arabia supported by the nation’s sovereign fund. Humain intends to procure CPUs, GPUs, and software from AMD to enhance its data centers and AI infrastructure. Overall, Humain anticipates constructing data centers with approximately 1.9 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. Importantly, Humain asserts that the arrangement with AMD is to avoid being dependent on a single vendor for AI-related hardware. This message is favorable for AMD stock, as we have noted that customers diversifying their suppliers away from Nvidia inherently presents an opportunity, especially considering the rapidly expanding AI market. Furthermore, sovereign AI—essentially state-funded initiatives for AI capabilities—is an area that semiconductor companies are increasingly focusing on, aiming to lessen reliance on a client base predominantly made up of large U.S. technology firms like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. It’s encouraging that AMD is also securing contracts in this sector. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? AMD's results for Q1 surpassed expectations, with its outlook for Q2 also exceeding predictions. Revenue grew by 36% to $7.44 billion in Q1, while earnings reached $0.96 per share. The growth was driven by robust data center sales, which surged 57% to $3.7 billion, thanks to increased GPU and CPU shipments. For quite some time now, AMD's CPUs have been gaining market share from Intel in the data center segment. Although AMD's GPU products do not match Nvidia's offerings at the high end, the AI surge is benefiting the overall market, with new large-scale models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and China's DeepSeek R1 poised to drive increased demand for GPUs. As the company secures new GPU and AI data center agreements, and customers seek to diversify their chip sources, AMD stands to gain. Earlier this month, AMD mentioned that new U.S. export restrictions targeting its MI308 AI chips could cut its 2025 revenue by $1.5 billion. The company also indicated that it might incur a charge of up to $800 million related to inventory, purchasing commitments, and reserves associated with these restrictions. According to the new regulations, AMD must secure a license to ship advanced AI processors to China. This was perceived as a setback since China constitutes about 24% of its revenue. However, there seems to be a silver lining. U.S.-China trade relations appear to be improving, with both nations agreeing to suspend triple-digit tariffs for the next 90 days and making progress in discussions over the previous weekend. This fosters hope that chip export restrictions may soon be reviewed. The rise in AMD stock over the last four years has not been steady, with annual returns showing much more volatility compared to the S&P 500. The stock recorded returns of 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, 128% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has been significantly less volatile. Moreover, it has outperformed the S&P 500 comfortably over the last four years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a smoother performance as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current unpredictable macroeconomic landscape concerning rate reductions and ongoing international conflicts, could AMD experience a repeat of the underperformance seen in 2022 and 2024 compared to the S&P over the upcoming 12 months, or will it witness a notable surge? We assess AMD stock at approximately $107 per share, which aligns closely with its current market price.

May 15, 2025 06:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Mitsotakis, Adonis and “the short legs”, Laskaridis’ proposal to shipowners, Divani, President for sale, the government’s message to Ivan Savvidis

Full Content:
Hello, yesterday was a day that in terms of news was essentially characterized by what we call in our journalistic jargon “aftermath” from the NTUA report on Tempi. In Parliament we had… many goals and spectacle from Floridis who, although he doesn’t look like it, when he opens his little mouth not even the Galikos river near his hometown in Kilkis can wash you clean, since he found Velopoulos in front of him and turned him into balm with everything this charming and picturesque guy was saying—who, frankly, I don’t see why anyone would want to argue with him, really. Everyone knows there’s always a…Velopoulos in Parliament for as long as I can remember. You’ll say that these pagan-style theories about the 13 missing railcars, the 33 tons of wood alcohol, the smugglers, and the hidden NATO weapons in the railcars, etc., have been heard from the entire opposition for the past three months and we almost believed them too, but never mind, if only the trains had been fixed and so many innocent lives hadn’t been lost and everything else just confirms that the conspiracy crowd was and will always be among us. And the Opposition? Now in the “serious opposition” —and in that, apart from our leader Nikos, I now also include SYRIZA— which since the day before yesterday has been struck by what Vissi sings, “awkwardnesssssss, awkwardnessss, what can you say to me, what can I say to youuuuuu.” Some minor announcements, some half-statements about the Karonis report, there’s also that proposal for a preliminary investigation by PASOK, we’ll see if anything else comes up because on the Tempi issue “we pretty much got screwed,” as Tzakri says. Mitsotakis–Adonis Yesterday Mitsotakis appeared alongside Adonis at the ygeiamou.gr (our own) conference and before going on stage to speak, a nearby interlocutor asked him what he would say about the Karonis report since he was bound to be asked—especially by the discussion’s moderator Sroiter, who hadn’t seen him since the infamous and very difficult interview he gave him on Alpha three months ago. So, Adonis, who had spoken at the conference a few minutes earlier and had said, “I’ve learned to speak my mind and shout whatever I believe is true,” encouraged him (K.M.) to…say everything right then and there about Tempi. “Say a good word for me too, President, that I was right in the end,” Georgiadis said to him smiling, but Mitsotakis chose to refer very briefly to the Tempi issue, simply because he knows very well that it doesn’t lend itself to celebration. So he limited himself to publicly declaring that “it always proves that lies have short legs, we’ll say the rest in Parliament.” Laskaridis’ idea for €1 billion in annual sponsorships Meanwhile, yesterday morning before heading to the ygeiamou.gr conference, Mitsotakis went to the facilities of the Supreme Military Command of the Interior and Islands (ASDEN), where together with Dendias and the Army leadership they inaugurated four ultra-modern drones that will be integrated into the overall weapon system “Achilles’ Shield,” and as the responsible minister said, will excellently oversee the security of our islands in the Aegean from above. (…those old P-3B Orion planes of Kammenos are no match!). This new weapons system is yet another donation from Thanasis Laskaridis, who a few months ago also donated the Special Cyber Unit currently under construction at the Ministry of National Defense. So, after the Prime Minister and the Minister thanked Laskaridis for his ongoing contributions, the shipowner himself took the floor and said: “In Greece today we have more than 300 serious shipping firms (i.e., shipowners); if the 100 largest of them gave a donation of 10 million euros each annually, we’d gather a significant amount of about 1 billion euros. Such an amount would be extremely useful either for national defense or for our country’s other major problem, the demographic issue.” Let’s see, let’s see, will anyone listen to the proposal? Because honestly, 1 billion euros a year in state sponsorships could make a huge difference everywhere—in healthcare, in education, and in demographics, apart from defense of course. Divani – President remain in the frame for sale Let’s start with the hotel market, where developments are dense and often some deals that seem stalled remain warm. Thus, banking sources said that the process of selling the Divani Group hotels has not been frozen, even though the non-binding offers gathered by Citigroup as financial advisor came… below the threshold that had been set at around 700 million euros. At the same time, there seems to be movement with the President Hotel on Kifisias Avenue in Ampelokipi. One of the hotel’s strong advantages, apart from its location, is that it has a large number of rooms—517 in total—while it is said there’s interest from funds and foreign groups that have been steadily expanding their presence in the domestic market in recent years. ThPA (OLTH): The behind-the-scenes, the message, and the guarantees Yesterday at noon, a few hours before the start of the shareholders’ general assembly of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (OLTH), the state’s representative on the port’s board sent a new letter withdrawing his objections to convening the assembly. The people from the Superfund clearly did not decide to make fools of themselves with back-and-forth decisions. The behind-the-scenes that preceded relates to the overall change in stance and strategy of the Superfund across all companies it participates in, and a message that it is not a passive shareholder that simply rubber-stamps management decisions. And it doesn’t stop there. For the first time in a while, the government—through the Superfund’s stance—sent a message to every concessionaire that infrastructure progress concerns not only investors but also the state, which remains the infrastructure owner. Therefore, it demands development according to master plans and, of course, implementation of mandatory investments that must be executed within each infrastructure’s investment period. In OLTH’s case, the exercise is even more complex: there are other projects with political and social significance that share the same investor. Consequently, the need for the immediate launch of Pier 6 and other projects at OLTH moved high on the agenda with the emphasis “urgent.” The government wants Thessaloniki—with the port, the Egnatia Highway, the Gonou military camp, the HELEXPO, and the new healthcare infrastructure—to become a strong economic hub and bridge for the Western Balkans and Europe. Before giving its approval for the General Assembly to proceed, the Superfund set and received specific guarantees for the immediate start and uninterrupted completion of the projects within schedule. Ivan, the power shifts on the Board, and the Government’s intentions Tomorrow the €2 per share dividend of OLTH will be “cut,” which after a 5% tax withholding comes to a net amount of €1.90. Shareholders witnessed a general assembly with suspicious calm. It became clear that Ivan Savvidis’ side wants to impose new balances on the Board of Directors. Thanasis Liagos technically has not resigned yet, but he will not be in the position of President in the new Board and seems caught in a tug-of-war among the involved (shareholding) sides, while he will assume the position of management advisor. Today, the shareholding structure at OLTH is 67% owned by South Europe Gateway Thessaloniki (SEGT) Ltd (6,753,600 shares), 7.3% by the Superfund (732,594 shares), and the remaining 25.7% of the share capital (2,593,806 shares) belongs to the general investing public. Let’s also recall the government’s intervention in the Volos Port tender, where awarding it to Ivan Savvidis was canceled—a development that also reveals its intentions and disposition regarding Thessaloniki’s future. Airports are soaring The 14 regional airports managed by Fraport Greece continue to show steady growth, with total passenger traffic recording a 4.9% increase in April, reaching 1.75 million passengers. At the beginning of the summer season, international traffic also rose by 4.9%, reaching 1.14 million passengers. As expected for this period, Thessaloniki recorded the highest volume of traffic among the 14 airports (Aktio, Chania, Corfu, Kavala, Kefalonia, Thessaloniki, Zakynthos, Kos, Mytilene, Mykonos, Rhodes, Samos, Santorini, Skiathos), with over 626 thousand passengers, up 8.1%. For Thessaloniki in particular, international traffic figures are even more encouraging, with a 9.4% increase reaching 389 thousand passengers. Among the major destinations, Rhodes had a strong start with a 12% increase compared to April last year, reaching 378 thousand passengers, while Chania recorded a 6.5% increase (199 thousand passengers), and Corfu 4.9% at 171 thousand. Although with a smaller volume of 36 thousand passengers, Mytilene is a pleasant surprise with double-digit growth rates, +17.3% in April for combined domestic-international traffic and +10.6% for international traffic alone. Santorini is the big loser of April with a -27.8% drop, slightly above 129 thousand passengers, while Mykonos showed a marginal increase of 1% with slightly over 46 thousand passengers, and a 9.3% drop in international traffic (around 17.5 thousand). For the four-month period, total passenger traffic from January to April 2025 exceeded 3.9 million passengers compared to 3.77 million in the same period last year (+3.7%), with international traffic accounting for over 2 million, marking a 5.7% increase from last year. Thessaloniki alone accounts for over half of this four-month traffic, or over 2 million passengers, up 8.3%, with international traffic specifically reaching +10% and 1.247 million passengers. The master builder’s drought Dimitris Koutras, a “master builder” of the sector, saw his plans for Domiki Kritis not unfold quite as he had hoped. The leap from a local construction company to one with nationwide reach, even if you have the experience, requires time, structure, and organization. And in those areas, the company still has a long way to go. The slowdown in the pace of construction projects is also reflected in the profits of the most recent fiscal year (217,000 euros compared to 2.771 million euros in 2023) for Domiki Kritis—a picture that is also reflected on the stock board, with the share price falling below 2 euros. Since last August, Domiki Kritis has been the provisional contractor for the Kelefina dam (tendered in 2023), valued at 25 million euros. However, due to legal appeals, the contract has stalled. If all goes well, according to sources, the signatures are expected soon, as the outcome favors the company, offering a lifeline to the current project backlog which is below 40 million euros and struggling to “get off the ground” with new contracts. The company is also the lowest bidder for a pedestrian bridge in Elliniko and has secured the renovation of the Panteion University building. Non-stop deals in insurance The capital increase in Europe Holdings is nearing completion (the rights exercise period ends tomorrow, 16/5, and trading of the new shares on the Athens Exchange is expected to begin on 26/5), and acquisition time has arrived. In fact, there are two acquisitions: NAK Insurance Brokers is being acquired, and, as many expected, full control is being taken of AMYNA – Insurance Brokers, which for years had shareholders from the Kokkalis Group. At the same time, the stock of Intracom Group’s subsidiary has gained momentum on the board, and its capitalization has reached 250 million euros. The insurance sector as a whole is undergoing intense activity, and in the coming period, we will see more deals across the entire market spectrum, regardless of size. Already, Mega Brokers of the Chatziotheodosiou family, a major player in Greek insurance brokerage, has acquired “Athinaiki Insurance Agents,” a company with a 30-year presence in insurance consulting and program management. HelleniQ Energy won’t impress The results that HelleniQ Energy will announce today will not excite the investment community. Reduced profitability—among other external factors—is due to the fact that one of its two refineries (Elefsina) remained closed for maintenance for four weeks. Additionally, there was a significant decline in international oil prices and refining margins. Sources indicate that the refining margin for the first quarter of 2025 dropped to $5.2/barrel compared to $7.8/barrel in the same period last year. As a result, the first quarter of 2025 for HelleniQ Energy includes reduced production (due to the closed refinery) along with increased energy and payroll expenses. Nevertheless, the stock of HelleniQ Energy is closely tracking Motor Oil, which has already reached a capitalization of 2.5 billion euros. Yesterday, HelleniQ Energy closed the session at €7.98 (+1.72%) and its capitalization exceeded €2.4 billion. OLP hit 1.1 billion euros Although the MSCI restructuring did not involve changes to the main index for Greek stocks, it held a pleasant surprise for OLP. The stock was included in the MSCI Greece Small Cap Index and is now more visible to the investment community. This development acted as an extra “fuel,” resulting in the extension of its historical record. Specifically, yesterday it rose by 3.5% to 44.5 euros and reached up to 45 euros at the day’s high. Trading activity also picked up compared to usual levels, with a turnover of 939 thousand euros and over 21 thousand shares traded. The stock’s performance this year is estimated at +48.3%, while its market value now exceeds 1.1 billion euros. The average target price is set at 48 euros, which means there is an upside potential of about 7.9% from current levels. An additional catalyst is the proposed dividend of 1.92 euros for fiscal year 2024, up 43.7% compared to 2023, when it was 1.34 euros. The “green light” is expected to be given at the annual general meeting on July 22. The ex-dividend date is scheduled for August 4, and payment for August 8. The Qualco Party The trading of Qualco’s stock starts today at €5.46. Following the impressive oversubscription of the Public Offering, only 10% reached retail investors, which might justify a “small party” for the stock in its early trading days. Approximately €563 million was offered in the Public Offering. A total of 20,700,000 common registered shares of the group were made available. Excluding the shares allocated to Cornerstone investors—Latsco Hellenic Holdings, Antenna Group BV, and Green Hydepark—the remaining shares were oversubscribed 8 times. Of the €563 million submitted in the Public Offering, €189 million came from subscriptions outside Greece. Qualco raised €47.7 million in net funds, which management pledged to use for its 5-year investment plan focused on strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in Greece and beyond. Stock Market: The Mood Shifted After 4 PM The goal is clear: the General Index wants to conquer 1,800 points. However, from 1,780 points and beyond, there are many interested sellers who would prefer to lock in profits, since the General Index has already gained over 21% since the beginning of the year. At the same time, investors are awaiting tomorrow’s derivatives closing. Yesterday, the General Index began with the usual “short-term profit-taking,” dropping to 1,780.99 points (-0.42%), but after 4 PM, buyers reappeared in the banks, pushing the Index up to 1,790.99 points (+0.14%). There were numerous block trades totaling over €32.9 million, while the total trading value reached €175.5 million. OPAP recorded the swiftest rebound after its dividend cut and, with trades worth €15.3 million (including a €4.84 million block at €20.17), closed at its highest price in the last 16 years at €20.2 (+0.5%). All banks (except National Bank) closed in positive territory. GEK TERNA (+1.74%) reached €19.25, AKTOR (+1.32%) €5.38, and Aegean (+1.09%) €12.96. OTE’s results did not satisfy the market, and the stock dropped to €17.1 (-1.44%). Despite market expectations, TITAN was not included in the MSCI Greece Standard Index, and the stock fell -0.48% to €41.75, while JUMBO—despite its charming new radio ad—saw profit-taking at €28.28 (-0.56%). Genekor to Announce New Deal Genekor Medical SA is a 100% Greek company in the field of molecular diagnostics in Europe. It already operates branches in 8 countries. Sources report that within the coming days (or hours?), it will announce another Balkan deal. The agreement concerns a strategic alliance with Kandilarov Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, a leading player in healthcare in Bulgaria. The two companies will leverage their expertise in research, development, and—most importantly—access. Their collaboration will focus on key areas of molecular oncology such as treatment response, identification of hereditary syndromes, and early cancer detection. Greece is exporting know-how in high-level healthcare services. Even the Scandinavians Are Now Considering Nuclear Power “Nuclear energy? No, thanks,” was the stance of Scandinavians in the 1980s. Today, things seem to have changed. Denmark—the country of wind turbines and cool energy—is now reconsidering its 1985 nuclear ban. Sweden, which closed most of its nuclear power plants over the past decade, has also changed course, with the new government supporting nuclear power, given that artificial intelligence requires massive amounts of energy. In 2005, Danes celebrated Sweden’s closure of a nuclear plant near their capital, Copenhagen. Today, they are “studying” next-generation mini reactors. Lars Aagaard, Denmark’s Minister of Climate, Energy and Public Utilities, is scheduled next week to argue in parliament in favor of small nuclear reactors. “There’s progress in new nuclear energy technologies with small modular reactors.” Large energy demands are leading to a different approach toward the once-taboo issue of “nuclear.” Explore related questions

Title: Amazon layoffs: 100 jobs cut from teams serving Alexa and Kindle in corporate trim

Amazon layoffs: E-commerce giant Amazon is cutting around 100 jobs in its devices and services division, which includers workers involved with the Alexa voice assistance and e-reader product Kindle, according to a report by Bloomberg. This moves comes as the company makes effort to “trim” its corporate workforce, it added. In a statement on May 14, Kristy Schmidt, spokeswoman for Amazon confirmed the layoffs and said that it is a part of the company's effort to “operate more efficiently” “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product road map, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transitions,” Schmidt added. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has begun the Seattle-based online retailer’s biggest-ever round of corporate job cuts. And as many as 27,000 workers were given the pink slip. Since then, several smaller rounds of layoffs in particular departments have led to job cuts across the company's various department, including some cuts in the communication division in January 2025. Till March 2025, Amazon had 1.56 million workers — the number include those on the rolls in full-time and part-time jobs. This is up 3 per cent comapred to 2024. However, the e-commerce giant’s workforce is mostly made up of hourly wage earners or logistics employees in its warehouse and delivery network. The job cuts at Amazon’s devices team were reported earlier by Reuters. This development comes after Microsoft Corporation on May 13 (Tuesday) also confirmed that it is cutting 6,000 jobs across departments in a bid to “reduce management layers”, the BB report added.

Title: Amazon Cuts 100 Jobs in Devices Unit Amid Ongoing Efficiency Drive
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2025/amazon-cuts-100-jobs-in-devices-unit-amid-ongoing-efficiency-drive/
Time Published: 2025-05-15T00:56:08Z

Amazon reportedly cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. The layoffs amount to a small portion of the unit’s total workforce, Reuters reported Wednesday (May 14), citing a company spokesperson. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” the spokesperson said, according to the report. Amazon’s devices and services unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox robotaxi, the report said. The spokesperson did not say which divisions saw layoffs, it added. Bloomberg also reported on the job cuts Wednesday, noting that Amazon has made several rounds of layoffs targeting specific departments and the company has about 1.56 million full– and part-time employees. In January, Amazon laid off dozens of people in its communications department. A company spokesperson said at the time that the changes were made after a review “to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and brings teams closer to customers.” It was reported at the time that Amazon has cut tens of thousands of corporate jobs since Andy Jassy became the company’s CEO in 2021. These include 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles. When announcing in January 2023 that Amazon planned to lay off more than 18,000 workers, Jassy said the economy was uncertain, the company had hired rapidly for several years, and leaders across the company were prioritizing the things that matter most to customers and the long-term health of the business. In September, Jassy said Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office. “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy said.
