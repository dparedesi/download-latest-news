Anthony Pompliano hailed Tether’s leadership and “pro-America” stance. Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, recently revealed a bold investment strategy focused on fueling growth within the United States. Over the past two years, Tether has funnelled approximately $5 billion of its profits into American companies and infrastructure, signaling a strong commitment to supporting domestic innovation. In a recent announcement on X, CEO Paolo Ardoino highlighted these significant investments, describing them as part of a “pro-America” approach. Taking to X, Ardoino said, “In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures.” Notably, earlier this year, Tether acquired more than 103 million shares of Class A stock in Rumble, committing $775 million to the video platform. Additionally, through its venture arm Tether Evo, the company invested $200 million in BlackRock Neurotech in 2024, becoming the majority stakeholder in the promising brain-interface startup. Responding to this, Anthony Pompliano added, “Tether has quickly become one of the most important pro-America companies in the world. Thank you for everything that you and the team have done.” In addition to its strategic equity investments, Tether has established a substantial footprint in U.S Treasury securities, holding more than $120 billion in total exposure. This portfolio includes direct purchases, money market funds, and reverse repurchase agreements, positioning Tether as the 19th-largest global holder of U.S Treasury bills. In fact, it has also surpassed Germany’s $111.4 billion stake, according to data from the U.S Treasury Department. These U.S Treasury holdings are vital in supporting USDT’s value, helping maintain its dollar peg and market stability. A significant portion of these holdings is reportedly managed through Cantor Fitzgerald, a prominent American financial services firm. This simply underscores Tether’s reliance on trusted domestic institutions to safeguard its reserve assets. Here, it’s worth noting that in 2025, USDT has recorded figures of $2.09 trillion in transaction volume, with USDC trailing behind at $1.30 trillion, according to Visa’s on-chain analytics. Tether has also recently issued an additional $1 billion worth of USDT on the Tron (TRX) blockchain network. Despite its dominant market position, Tether faces ongoing demands for greater transparency regarding its reserve holdings. Additionally, the stablecoin has drawn criticism for its occasional use by illicit actors. However, the company maintains that it actively collaborates with law enforcement agencies to identify and address any criminal activities involving USDT. This could be a sign of its commitment to regulatory compliance amid growing scrutiny.

Title: JioBlackRock AMC to widen reach, target flows with factor-based passive funds

Capital market regulator SEBI has given permission to Reliance Industries-owned Jio Financial Services and the American multi-national investment management company BlackRock to enter the mutual fund business in six months. The combination of Reliance Jio’s vast digital reach with BlackRock’s global investment expertise, the joint venture will democratise investment opportunities by attracting first-time retail investors. The competition in the MF industry has intensified with the entry of new players especially after SEBI eased the entry barriers to allow more players to enter asset management business and attract new investors from smaller cities. In last one year, the asset under MF industry increased 23 per cent to ₹70 lakh crore while the value of assets held by individual investors in MFs increased 21 per cent to ₹42 lakh crore. In fact, it will be a re-entry after 7 years for BlackRock into the Indian MF business after it sold 40 per cent stake in DSP MF. Tanmay Shah, MD, stock broking firm SIHL said the entry of Jio BlackRock into the asset management business marks a potentially disruptive shift, given the fact that MF penetration is still low. However, he said challenges remain in building investors trust, navigating regulatory requirements and competing with well-established AMCs. On the distribution side, AMFI last year granted execution-only platform license to Jio Payment Bank, a subsidiary of Jio Financial Services. EOP is a digital or online platform, which facilitates MF transactions such as subscription, redemption and switch transactions. Sunil Subramaniam, CEO of independent think-tank Sense and Simplicity said JioBlackRock will try to target becoming the largest player in the passives space by launching multiple factor-based passive funds which tweak an index to generate higher alpha and attract investment from large institutional investors like provident funds and family offices. By bringing in variation in the passive categories, the fund house may be able to charge a slightly higher fee. Using Jio’s marketing muscle it will try to protect its margins by going direct to customers, he said. With Jio Financial focusing on marketing and customer acquisition, and BlackRock bringing in its global expertise in passives, JioBlackRock MF will attempt to disrupt the market and achieve scale in the shortest possible time, he added. The fund will also open an office in GIFT City to channel inward and outbound foreign investments to take advantage of Blackrock’s Global expertise, said Subramaniam.

However, the NCLT’s order did not specify the reliefs. Media reports said relief included freezing of accounts held by Gensol and its promoters, among others. Gensol Engineering Ltd. along with other respondent companies and associated individuals, have committed grave violations of corporate governance norms, the counsel for the Ministry of Corporate Affairs told NCLT. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.’s board will consider a buyback of certain dollar-denominated bonds in this financial year, subject to market conditions. The board will meet on Saturday to mull the proposal, according to a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday.

Title: Bitcoin Over Gold? BlackRock Says The Case Is Clear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-over-gold-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T23:00:47Z
Full Content:
Speaking from the Nakamoto Stage at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, made a compelling case for BTC’s unique position in global finance—suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager sees Bitcoin not only as a legitimate portfolio hedge but also as a superior alternative to gold. Mitchnick described the performance of BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) as “unprecedented,” but emphasized that this was still the early stage of adoption. “It’s very early in the life cycle of an ETF,” he said. “In many instances, it takes multiple years to truly get all the cylinders firing—from education to institutional diligence to onboarding across major wealth platforms.” While IBIT has already gained massive traction in US markets, BlackRock has recently launched a similar product in Europe and sees global expansion as essential. “We’re excited,” Mitchnick said. “This has really been a global story… even if you look at IBIT’s numbers, a massive amount of that actually comes from offshore wealth channels, including Asia.” A key theme of Mitchnick’s remarks was the growing institutional normalization of BTC. He cited BlackRock’s own model portfolios—widely used by wealth managers—as a turning point. “In February of this year, just about three months ago, one of those portfolios added Bitcoin as an allocation in the 1 to 2% range,” Mitchnick said. “That was not a sudden reaction to any one thing—that was the result of multiple years of analysis and research.” These allocations, he explained, allow financial advisers to include BTC without requiring direct client demand, accelerating passive adoption across advisory networks. Mitchnick pushed back hard against the long-standing claim that BTC merely behaves like a speculative tech stock. “Through most of Bitcoin’s history, it’s had very low correlation [to equities],” he noted. While he acknowledged periods of short-term alignment—particularly among leveraged retail traders—he argued that institutional investors see BTC differently: “They view Bitcoin as a differentiator in a portfolio and a potential hedge against some of the left-tail risks that exist elsewhere in traditional assets.” He illustrated the point with a sharp anecdote: “Think back to August 5th… the market had a mini meltdown and Bitcoin got clobbered that day. It had nothing to do with Bitcoin fundamentally… but Bitcoin doubled over the next four months.” According to Mitchnick, this shows how short-term volatility often leads to accumulation by long-term holders—those who view Bitcoin not as a “risk-on asset” but as a monetary hedge. Asked directly about the ongoing gold-versus-BTC debate, Mitchnick avoided the typical zero-sum framing. “They’re both global, scarce, decentralized, fixed-supply assets,” he said. “Gold has much less volatility and a longer history. But Bitcoin is digitally native, efficient to store, and can be transferred anywhere in near real time at near-zero cost.” Then he delivered the verdict: “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold—and lower downside.” He also addressed why this narrative isn’t more dominant. “It’s amazing to me that the industry hasn’t promoted this more effectively,” he said, criticizing financial media and research firms that still link BTC’s value to irrelevant macro headlines. “Bitcoin’s never heard of tariffs. Doesn’t know what they are.” When asked about future crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Mitchnick drew a firm line. “Bitcoin is in a category of one,” he said. “The rest of crypto competes in different lanes, with different use cases… it looks more like tech equities or venture exposure.” As a result, he expects the correlation between BTC and other digital assets to fall further. On the topic of regulation, Mitchnick welcomed the growing bipartisan interest in Washington. “It’s just a great and encouraging thing that there is such momentum behind developing a regulatory framework,” he said. “Whether we’re talking about stablecoins or market structure, there’s great momentum there—and we’re excited to see how that shakes out.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,879.

Title: Nvidia overcomes tariff-driven turbulence to deliver Q1 results that eclipsed projections
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/28/nvidia/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T21:14:52Z

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human. The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward. But Trump’s tariffs — many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended – hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry’s prospects. Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia’s report for its fiscal first quarter. Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government’s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts. In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter. “Global demand for NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. The performance bolstered Nvidia’s shares, which gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia’s stock price ended Wednesday’s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth. The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology’s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company’s annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years. Wedbush Securities analyst estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia’s chips. Trump’s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia’s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off key market, especially China. In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia’s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil. Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden’s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.

XRP is back in the spotlight, now trading hands at just under $2.30. Investors remain bullish as excitement builds over a potential U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the near future. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now evaluating whether a proposed XRP ETF by WisdomTree offers adequate investor protection and safeguards against manipulation. The fund would be a major step toward broader institutional access and legitimacy for the Ripple-affiliated crypto if approved. According to a May 27 notice published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has started reviewing the WisdomTree XRP Trust. This marks the first formal review of a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF by the Commission. The SEC now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the ETF filing that would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without having to hold or store the token themselves. The investment vehicle would track XRP’s market price via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate. If greenlighted, the WisdomTree XRP Trust would be the first American spot XRP market ETF — a watershed that could unlock the door for similar vehicles based on other altcoins. The Commission is now looking for public comments on whether the ETF’s design satisfactorily addresses concerns related to market manipulation and investor protection. Besides WisdomTree, a bevy of other investment managers, including Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale, have all applied with the SEC to introduce XRP ETFs in the U.S. This comes as a new Trump-Vance administration has rolled into Washington, which has taken a more lenient approach to crypto. The SEC itself has also turned a new regulatory leaf following former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s departure in January, dropping most of the high-profile cases lodged during the Biden era. Bloomberg senior ETF analysts forecast an 85% chance of spot XRP ETF approval after the change in leadership at the SEC. The price of XRP is trading lower by 3.4% over the past 24 hours to $2.26. Approval of spot exchange-traded funds could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for XRP and potentially propelling prices toward $10. Some analysts even believe the XRP price could hit the elusive $100 threshold if prominent players like BlackRock and Fidelity jump into the ring.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose roughly 4% in post-trading hours after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday. The AI powerhouse posted a 69% increase in revenue in the first quarter, compared to a year ago, with its data center business growing 73% year-over-year. Net income came in at $18.8 billion, up 26% from a year earlier. The after-hours move pushed NVDA shares to a modest year-to-date gain and about a 20% year-over-year advance. AI crypto tokens, including Bittensor , NEAR Protocol NEAR$2.63 and Internet Computer (CIP), moved slightly higher after Nvidia’s earnings beat, although remained sizably lower for the day. Nevertheless, it was ongoing AI demand which was a key driver in the 73% growth in the company data center business. Turning to the outlook amid recent global trade uncertainties, Nvidia said it expects second-quarter revenue to come in below market estimates as a result of tariff-related restrictions between the U.S. and China.

Title: Nvidia beats on earnings again — even while it's locked out of China

Time Published: 2025-05-28T20:54:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) continues to go beyond expectations — even if things are a little more complicated this time around. Its strong first-quarter headline numbers show that Nvidia’s AI thesis is as strong as ever and that its margins remain elite, despite facing significant headwinds due to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 processors to China and other geopolitical concerns. After the bell on Wednesday, the $3.3 trillion chipmaker reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter, up 69% from the same period a year ago, and the company reported a $18.78 billion profit. Analysts had forecasted a revenue surge to $43.26 billion. The H20 restrictions led to a $4.5 billion write-down related to excess inventory and a $2.5 billion revenue shortfall, affecting the company’s gross margins. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.81, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $0.75. Without the H20 charge and the related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.96. Stock soared over 5% in after-hours trading and is up 25% over the past month, reflecting investor confidence amid mixed guidance and continuing market uncertainties. With demand for generative AI infrastructure still booming and competitors struggling to catch up, Nvidia’s performance exceeded expectations. In a Tuesday note, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said that Nvidia’s earnings would likely be a “bright green light” for the tech sector — especially companies heavily invested in the “AI Revolution.” And it was. The company’s Data Center division brought in an almost unreal $39.1 billion in the first quarter, up 10% from the previous quarter and up 73% from a year ago. That means Nvidia’s fastest-growing segment is now responsible for nearly 89% of all revenue — a sign of how deeply embedded its chips are in the AI build-out. Analysts had expected this division to generate around $37 billion in Q1 revenue. On a post-earnings-release call, CEO Jensen Huang said there are four positive surprises so far in 2025: the demand of reasoning AI, the removal of the AI diffusion rule, enterprise AI, and industrial AI. He said he foresees continued growth opportunities in AI. “AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate,” Huang said. “Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.” He said the demand for AI reasoning is up, and “we would like to serve all of it, and I think we’re on track to serve most of it.” Looking ahead, Nvidia projects Q2 revenue around $43 billion, slightly below Q1 figures, with gross margins expected to remain in the low 70% range. Nvidia’s outlook for this coming quarter reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion. Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist for Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, said in a note immediately after the earnings release that he remains “bullish” on Nvidia with a year-end price target of $165. “In our view, Nvidia remains the premier Artificial Intelligence stock and the dominant leader in GPUs,” Tentarelli wrote. Nvidia has long relied on the Chinese market for a sizable chunk of its revenue, but that has changed dramatically in the wake of tightening U.S. export controls and tariffs. And the market is watching Nvidia warily. “The question is not whether China will have AI. It already does. The question is whether one of the world’s latest AI markets will run on American platforms,” Huang said. “Export controls should strengthen U.S. platforms, not drive half of the world’s AI talent to rivals.” To maintain its foothold, Nvidia is pursuing R&D efforts in Shanghai and developing China-specific downgraded chips that comply with current restrictions. The company is ground zero in the U.S.-China tech rivalry — its GPUs might just be the most valuable components in the AI arms race, and its position is increasingly shaped by policy, not just engineering. Huang said the president has a plan — “he has a vision, and I respect it,” he said. “For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue,” Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said. “Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide.” Huang said there’s a bright future for onshore AI manufacturing in the U.S. — the company’s goal is “from chip to super computer — build in America within a year.” And the company has more planned, too. Kress said the company’s Blackwell Ultra AI Server will start to ship out later this quarter. “With all the world and markets watching...the Godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell,” Ives wrote in a post-earnings-release note Wednesday. The CEO has been on a world tour — China, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia — that will continue in the coming weeks as he heads to Europe. “Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure,” Huang said. The company also posted record revenue in its gaming business, which is Nvidia’s roots: $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. And while Nvidia’s auto revenue was down 1%, it’s up 72% year over year, driven by an increased appetite for self-driving cars. Nvidia has beat analysts’ earnings expectations in 14 of the past 16 quarters. So can anything slow Nvidia down? Maybe. Competition is heating up. AMD (AMD+0.47%) and Intel (INTC-1.50%) are sharpening their AI chip offerings, while hyperscalers are continuing to invest in custom silicon. And export restrictions remain a geopolitical wild card. Still, as the first-quarter earnings show, Nvidia’s moat is wide. Its software ecosystem, deep relationships with cloud providers, and product cadence make it more than just a chipmaker. It’s the AI era’s platform company. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Jarrett Stepman / @JarrettStepman Jarrett Stepman is a columnist for The Daily Signal. He is also the author of "The War on History: The Conspiracy to Rewrite America's Past." Send an email to Jarrett Trust in corporate media has disintegrated in recent years and even the most powerful legacy institutions are facing a reckoning. The Washington Post, which is owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, announced Monday that it was laying off a sizable chunk of its staff. “Today, we are announcing that The Washington Post is offering a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) to news employees with 10 or more years’ service at The Post, as well as to all members of the video department and to all members of the copy desk and sports copy desk,” Washington Post executive editor Matt Murray wrote in a staff memo obtained by Fox News. The memo further said that this was part of the Post’s “ongoing newsroom transformation efforts aimed at reshaping and modernizing the newsroom for the current environment.” It’s been a turbulent decade for the Post. It was one of the most aggressive defenders of the bureaucracy and the deep state in President Donald Trump’s first term. It leaned even further to the Left in the Biden years and went from denying that the deep state exists to actively celebrating it. It hired social media columnist Taylor Lorenz in 2022, a COVID-19 lockdown extremist to say the least. Lorenz eventually parted ways with the Post in October after she called President Joe Biden a war criminal, then seemingly tried to cover it up. By the way, she’s made a full transition from Left to bloodthirsty Left, openly gushing (might I say swooning?) over Luigi Mangione, who allegedly shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in cold blood. Lorenz was just a small part of the newspaper’s problems as their readership plummeted and it burned through money. In 2023 it laid off about 10% of its staff. Yet, the former media giant’s financial troubles continued. According to a January report in Semafor, the Post had “22.5 million daily active users” in January 2021 when Biden took office. By the middle of 2024, those numbers had dropped to “2.5-3 million daily users.” It gets worse. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the Post lost “around $100 million” last year. “The Post’s loss in 2024 was roughly 30% greater than the loss a year earlier, according to people close to the company,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “Advertising revenue fell to $174 million from $190 million in 2023, missing a target, according to a person familiar with the Post’s finances.” Bezos is a rich man but it’s clear that even he had his limits with a publication that was bleeding readership and money at an astounding rate. He seemed to conclude that the issue wasn’t merely a bloated staff, but something more fundamental. The publication didn’t endorse a presidential candidate in 2024. This was met, to no surprise, by much internal wailing and gnashing of the teeth. The publication continued laying off its staff as Trump was on the eve of retaking his office, despite The Washington Post Guild’s insistence that the publication was “growing.” A statement from the Guild on today's unconscionable layoffs at The Washington Post. pic.twitter.com/Xnn5NcNJFb Not long after, Bezos sent out a memo to staff that he shared on X saying that the publication was going to start focusing on two pillars: “personal liberties and free markets.” He also announced there would be a change in leadership for the opinion page. This appeared to cause another internal meltdown, with some Washington Post journalists lashing out publicly. Changes at the Post clearly haven’t come quickly enough given Monday’s news about additional layoffs. The publication remains reliably left-wing and produces a steady stream of anti-Trump news and editorials. It’s been one of the most constant critics of entrepreneur Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency layoffs of government employees, which is interesting given that its publication is currently getting the internal DOGE treatment. Much like the Democratic Party, The Washington Post hasn’t found a way to find its footing in the Trump years. Its audience has dwindled, Americans no longer implicitly trust it, and the true reboot has yet to take place as alternative media outlets thrive and take its place. Maybe, just maybe, legacy media outlets can try not being hyperbolically negative toward the Trump administration, supported by more than half the country, nearly 100% of the time. They could try finding just a little balance in their coverage and get back to basics. If they don’t, I imagine that the bottom will continue falling out and the layoffs will continue. Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Time Published: 2025-05-28T20:20:00Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the first quarter ended April 27, 2025, of $44.1 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 69% from a year ago. On April 9, 2025, NVIDIA was informed by the U.S. government that a license is required for exports of its H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61.0%, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3%. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.76 and $0.81, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge and related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.96. “Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer — a ‘thinking machine’ designed for reasoning— is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Global demand for NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation.” NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on July 3, 2025, to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2025. Q1 Fiscal 2026 Summary Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 excess inventory and purchase obligation charges, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 excess inventory and purchase obligation charges in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA on April 9, 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 products. H20 products were designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. In May, DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model on the developer platform Hugging Face. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

The IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock plans to acquire approximately 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg News reported on May 28. People familiar with the matter said Circle and its shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, are seeking to raise $624 million through the offering. Orders for the offering have reportedly exceeded the number of shares available, with the pricing scheduled for June 4. BlackRock already manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds roughly 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The fund reported nearly $30 billion in net assets as of April 30, 2024, based on the Circle IPO filing. The investment management firm could acquire its stake directly or through an affiliated entity, although its final participation remains subject to change. As a result, the IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. The filing also revealed a combined interest from major institutional investors, indicating heightened demand for equity in the stablecoin issuer as it prepares to enter the public markets. Circle’s USDC ranks as the second-largest US dollar-pegged stablecoin with a $61.3 billion market cap and plays a central role in crypto transfers. The stablecoin registered a $10 trillion year-to-date transfer volume as of April 30, according to data from Artemis. Pending legislation in Congress proposes backing stablecoins with cash or government securities, a structure already in place for USDC through the Circle Reserve Fund. Circle’s decision to proceed with a US-based IPO reflects broader efforts by crypto companies to secure public market capitalization at a time when federal regulatory policy is trending toward acceptance. Kraken is also reportedly eyeing an IPO for 2026. The IPO filing formalizes Circle’s long-anticipated listing plans, which previously included a terminated Special Purpose Acquisition Company deal in 2022. With backing from institutional players and a reserve fund managed by the world’s largest asset manager, Circle is positioning itself to expand operations under a more transparent and regulated capital structure.

Title: Part 3: Building an AI-powered assistant for investment research with multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/part-3-building-an-ai-powered-assistant-for-investment-research-with-multi-agent-collaboration-in-amazon-bedrock-and-amazon-bedrock-data-automation/

In the financial services industry, analysts need to switch between structured data (such as time-series pricing information), unstructured text (such as SEC filings and analyst reports), and audio/visual content (earnings calls and presentations). Each format requires different analytical approaches and specialized tools, creating workflow inefficiencies. Add on top of this the intense time pressure resulting from rapidly evolving industry conditions and narrow decision windows. Delayed analysis can mean missed opportunities or failure to identify emerging risks, with potentially significant financial consequences. AI-assistants boost productivity by automating routine data collection and processing tasks, surfacing relevant insights, and allowing analysts to focus on higher-value activities. However, a single AI agent struggles with complex, multistep investment research workflows to effectively handle the full spectrum of multiple specialized tasks. This is where multi-agent collaboration provides an advancement. By creating specialized AI subagents that excel in specific tasks and functionalities and using them together under a coordinated framework using an AI supervisor agent, we can address the full complexity of investment research workflows. A supervisor agent can intelligently decompose complex queries, delegate specialized tasks to subagents, and synthesize their outputs into comprehensive answers—similar to how a research team functions in the real world. The benefits of this approach are substantial, stemming from distributed problem-solving and specialization, improved accuracy through specialized expertise, enhanced scalability by adding new agent capabilities without rebuilding the entire system, and greater transparency because the reasoning process of each specialized agent can be tracked and verified. Amazon Bedrock Agents uses the reasoning of foundation models (FMs), APIs, and data to break down user requests, gather relevant information, and efficiently complete tasks. With the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock, you can build, deploy, and manage multiple AI agents working together on complex multistep tasks that require specialized skills. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) enables the generation of useful insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and video for your AI-powered applications, and it can be used as a parser when setting up a knowledge base for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. In this post, we walk through how to build a multi-agent investment research assistant using the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock. Our solution demonstrates how a team of specialized AI agents can work together to analyze financial news, evaluate stock performance, optimize portfolio allocations, and deliver comprehensive investment insights—all orchestrated through a unified, natural language interface. We use BDA as a parser when setting up a knowledge base for RAG workflows with multi-modal data. Amazon Nova understanding models are used as the large language models (LLMs) associated with the supervisor agents and subagents. Check the video that demonstrates the solution, Results from these agents are demonstrative, not to be taken as financial advice. The multi-agent investment research assistant is composed of a supervisor agent and three subagents (quantitative analysis agent, news agent, and smart summarizer agent) working together in a coordinated framework, as shown in the following diagram. The supervisor agent uses the instructions you provide to understand the structure and role of each collaborator agent. The supervisor agent orchestrates the overall investment research process by breaking down user prompts, delegating subtasks to specialized subagents, and consolidating their outputs to generate the final response. Each subagent is configured to carry out specialized tasks as follows: Multi-agent collaboration works as follows: This architecture uses the strengths of the different specialized agents to comprehensively address the various aspects of investment research, and the supervisor agent provides the intelligent orchestration. The following diagram is the technical architecture. Some of the key components and the associated codes of the technical architecture are: To deploy this solution, attach the appropriate permissions for Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to your execution role. You also need to deploy two AWS CloudFormation stacks: web_search and stock_data. For more information on the permission policy, CloudFormation stacks, and setting up the environment, refer to the README.md in the investment_research_agent repository on GitHub. To dive deeper into the solution and the code shown in this post, refer to the investment research assistant agent GitHub repo. The repo contains instructions for the end-to-end solution, including setting up the supervisor agent and subagents, associated action groups, unstructured data (earnings reports PDF files and earnings call audio files), and structured data (stocks time series). In the appendix at the end of this post, we share different questions asked by a financial analyst to the supervisor agent, the subagent invoked, and the answers from the supervisor agent. To clean up this solution, make sure to delete all agents, knowledge bases, and associated Amazon OpenSearch Serverless instances. Delete both the web_search and stock_data stacks. This will make sure that no charges are incurred after you’re finished testing this solution. Read the associated notebook in the GitHub repository for more instructions on cleaning up the agents. The multi-agent investment research assistant built using Amazon Bedrock Agents with its multi-agent collaboration feature represents how financial professionals can use AI to enhance their analytical capabilities. By using specialized agents—each focusing on distinct aspects of financial analysis—orchestrated by a supervisor agent, we’ve created a system that can process diverse data types, apply appropriate analytical techniques, and synthesize comprehensive insights in response to complex investment queries. The result is an AI assistant that can handle multistep financial analysis workflows that would otherwise overwhelm a single-agent system. The application of multi-agent collaboration extends broadly across the financial sector, from equity research and portfolio management to risk assessment and compliance monitoring. A complex financial workflow that requires multiple specialized skills and data sources can benefit from this architectural approach. The implementation uses key AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock for foundation models, the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon S3 for document storage, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless for vector search capabilities, and Lambda functions for specialized actions. This serverless architecture provides scalability, and the knowledge base integration provides context from financial documents to ground the AI’s responses in factual data.

BlackRock Inc. is considering acquiring roughly 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The IPO filing, made public on Tuesday, lays out plans to offer 24 million Class A shares — 9.6 million from Circle and 14.4 million from existing stakeholders. According to the filing, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in buying up to $150 million worth of the IPO shares. The shares are expected to be priced between $24 and $26, and will be trading under the ticker 'CRCL'. BlackRock’s potential involvement, though significant, is still up in the air. Bloomberg reported that it remains unclear whether BlackRock would invest directly or via an affiliated vehicle, and that it could ultimately walk away from the deal. BlackRock didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. The asset management giant already maintains a close relationship with Circle. It manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. USDC is one of the largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, used widely across crypto trading and DeFi protocols. If BlackRock follows through, the move would mark another major entry point for traditional finance into the digital asset space, further entrenching stablecoins like USDC in the broader financial system. The IPO would make Circle one of the few large crypto-native firms to go public in the U.S. after a long lull in public market debuts from the sector. Circle previously attempted to go public via a SPAC merger in 202, which was subsequently scrapped.

Nvidia is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday, in what could be a major test of the AI trade’s resilience. Nvidia earnings are a blockbuster, market-moving event for Wall Street. Investors parse the results for any sign that AI demand or investment is waning, making the report a catalyst for AI infrastructure stocks. Most of these AI stocks are currently trading at or above their price heading into Nvidia's last earnings report at the end of February. Those results weighed heavily on the majority of AI beneficiaries. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and nuclear energy provider Vistra (VST) outpaced Nvidia’s (NVDA) 8.5% decline the day after its last report, tumbling 16% and 12%, respectively. Constellation Energy (CEG), also a nuclear power provider, slumped about 7.5%. Nvidia’s position as the world’s largest semiconductor company has made it something of a bellwether for the entire industry. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) tumbled more than 6% after Nvidia’s last report, its biggest decline since January’s DeepSeek panic caused the index to nosedive. Major Nvidia competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tumbled 7% and 5%, respectively. Chip fabrication services provider Lam Research (LRCX) and memory chip maker Micron (MU) also closed sharply lower. The companies that supply data centers with essential networking equipment also tend to move on AI demand signals parsed from Nvidia’s earnings. Shares of Arista Networks (ANET) slid 5% following Nvidia’s February report, while fiber optic technology provider Corning (GLW) shed 2% and network provider Lumen Technologies (LUMN) dropped 4%. Granted, stocks within the AI ecosystem don’t always move in tandem. Nvidia shares soared more than 9% on its earnings report one year ago, but the boost its results lent to other AI infrastructure stocks fizzled out before the day’s end.

The native token of the Telegram-affiliated The Open Network, the 18th largest crypto by market value, was trading at $3.37, CoinGecko data shows. TON soared to almost $3.70 and was up about 23% at one point earlier in the morning. Telegram’s fortunes, which have risen in recent months, continued to swing upward on Wednesday. The company is preparing to raise $1.5 billion in a corporate-bond sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing several sources familiar with the company's plans. The messaging platform will issue five-year bonds offering a 9% yield—a raise that has invited interest from Emirati-owned investment firm Mubadala, BlackRock, and hedge-fund manager Citadel, according to The Journal. Telegram has shared with investors that it clocked $540 million in profits on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024, people familiar with the matter told the publication—a major rebound from its lackluster performance the year prior. The app boasted one billion active users as of March 2025, according to Telegram's executives, and enrollment in its subscription services has roughly doubled over the past year or so. Separately, Telegram will deploy AI-powered chatbot Grok to its growing platform under the terms of a one-year agreement with Elon Musk's xAI, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said Wednesday in a social media post. Telegram will receive half of xAI's subscription sales made through the messaging platform, Durov tweeted. Later in the day, however, Musk pushed back on the announcement, replying on X hat "No deal has been signed." Durov replied, "True. Agreed in principle, but formalities are pending." The price of TON dipped following the exchange. Durov is still facing criminal charges in France related to alleged illegal activities hosted on Telegram, leaving the application's future somewhat uncertain. French authorities arrested Durov in August, alleging Telegram facilitated terrorism and drug trafficking enterprises, among other nefarious activities, on its platform. And earlier this month, authorities declined the founder's appeal to travel to the U.S. for "negotiations with investment funds,” POLITICO reported. Telegram created TON in 2018, but distanced itself from the network just two years later as it faced regulatory scrutiny over its role in the project. However, the messaging application began flirting with TON nearly two years later, hosting the TON Wallet App and tap-to-earn games in its application. The latter initiative helped TON garner widespread recognition last year, as viral tap-to-earn games such as Catizen and Hamster Kombat‌ amassed hundreds of millions of players on Telegram. Edited by James Rubin Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to include the X exchange between Elon Musk and Pavel Durov, and impact on TON's price.

May 28, 2025 12:10 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify and certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

With a dramatic one-two punch, a $300 million alliance with Elon Musk’s xAI and a $1.5 billion high-yield bond raise, Telegram has moved from insurgent platform to profit engine. TON jumped 15% after Durov confirmed the collaboration. Yet its future, including IPO prospects, remains hostage to a legal tangle playing out in French courts. In a headline-grabbing move, Telegram announced an exclusive distribution agreement with xAI that will embed Grok, Musk’s LLM chatbot, into the platform for one year. The terms: xAI will pay $300 million in cash, as well as equity and 50% of all Grok-related subscription revenue generated through Telegram. “Together, we win ❤️📈🏆,” posted CEO Pavel Durov, celebrating what he framed as a platform-defining moment. The move marks Telegram’s first major monetisation of its 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs) – a sharp pivot from its historically donation- and debt-fuelled operations. Durov has insisted that Grok integration won’t compromise user data: “No Telegram data will be supplied for Grok training,” he wrote. The deal puts Telegram ahead of rivals like WhatsApp and Snapchat, who’ve struggled to extract revenue from AI features within messaging ecosystems. Telegram also disclosed its first-ever profit: $540 million in 2024, on revenue of $1.4 billion. This figure marks a dramatic turnaround from prior years, when the company operated at a steep loss. With 15 million paying users and organic growth of 2.5 million users per day, 2025 revenue is forecasted at $2 billion, with profit exceeding $700 million. For investors, the metrics finally validate Telegram’s long-gestating monetisation model. Along with announcing its AI deal, Telegram completed an oversubscribed $1.5 billion bond offering at a 9% yield, with major backers including BlackRock, Citadel, and Mubadala, according to WSJ. The five-year paper refinances debt from a 2021 convertible note and includes an IPO-linked conversion sweetener, an implicit bet that Telegram will go public before 2030. The bond’s success surprised some market watchers, especially given CEO Durov’s ongoing legal entanglements. But investors appear willing to price that risk as noise against Telegram’s unit economics and growth profile. Despite operational momentum, a significant cloud looms over Telegram’s prospects: founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in France in August 2024 and subsequent indictment on 12 preliminary charges, including non-cooperation with child safety investigations. Durov remains under judicial supervision and is barred from leaving France. A May 12 court ruling blocked his planned trip to the U.S. to meet investors. “We complied with all the binding legal requests we received,” Durov told the WSJ. “Up until this day, we don’t understand what we did wrong.” The legal case could delay or derail IPO ambitions, raise governance concerns, and complicate global platform operations. It also emphasizes broader regulatory questions about the liabilities of end-to-end encrypted app providers. Is Telegram now on a glide path to IPO? Possibly, but not inevitably. The bond’s conversion feature suggests that at least the option remains alive. But some analysts argue the high-yield raise could be a bridge or even a hedge, a way to lock in growth without public-market scrutiny while Durov navigates his legal peril. The one-year Grok integration, too, carries open questions: Will AI subs stick? Can xAI deliver? Will regulators scrutinise the data layer despite Durov’s assurances? And if Musk stumbles, what becomes of the promised $300 million? Still, with its platform pivot, Telegram has shed the image of a burning-money outlier. Whether it becomes a public tech titan or a cautionary tale may depend as much on courtroom outcomes as on product-market fit. Telegram’s summer surge, marked by AI monetisation and a bold debt raise, signals a company evolving into a sustainable business. But Durov’s legal cloud may prove the ultimate variable in whether Telegram becomes the next great tech IPO or a cautionary tale of platform governance in the age of encryption.

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges."

Shares were trading around $137 a share. The stock is up nearly 2% year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 0.5% gain. Nvidia announced a partnership with Saudi tech firm Humain on May 13 to strengthen sovereign AI infrastructure and elevate the country's position as an AI developer. The chipmaker's stock surged to its highest valuation since February following the announcement. Nvidia said in an announcement that the first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will be a deployment of 18,000 Nvidia GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips. Nvidia defines "sovereign AI" as a nation's capability to produce AI with its own resources, the chipmaker wrote on its website. It's an area that Huang has emphasized multiple times. "It codifies your culture, your society's intelligence, your common sense, your history — you own your own data," Huang at the World Governments Summit in Dubai last year. — Ana Altcheck Huang announced at the tech show Computex on May 19 that Nvidia is looking at the Beitou Shilin area in northern Taipei for a new Nvidia office named "Nvidia Constellation." Taipei's mayor Chiang Wan-an, who showed up at Huang's keynote, said in an interview following the announcement that the city government welcomes the chipmaker's office and will provide assistance as needed. Huang, who was born in Taiwan, also announced a partnership with TSMC to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan. The project will be a joint effort between the Taiwanese government and Taiwan manufacturing firm Foxconn. — Ana Altchek At GTC this year, Jensen Huang announced plans for Nvidia to build a quantum research lab in Boston. "It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world," Huang said. "And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT." Wednesday's earnings call is the company's first since the announcement, and the quantum sector has been booming. Some notable startups include D-Wave, whose stock has risen over 138% in the last 30 days as of May 27; IonQ, whose shares have risen over 67% in the same timeframe; and Rigetti Computing, whose stock has increased by more than 53% in the last month. As tech giants, including Nvidia, expand their quantum offerings, investors are keen on tangible road maps for their progress in the burgeoning field. Expect to see those plans mentioned more often going forward. — Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had "considerably improved" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company "strategic importance" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients. "We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline," Zino said. "While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility," he added. It's the first earnings call for the company since US lawmakers said in April they were investigating how the Chinese AI company DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips. House Representatives said in a report that it appeared DeepSeek had used 60,000 Nvidia chips even though US sanctions limited the sale of the company's tech in China. The lawmakers also accused Jensen Huang of directing the design of Nvidia chips to get around US export controls. The company said in a statement at the time that "the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter." — Kelsey Vlamis While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote. The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Share this article RedStone is launching its blockchain oracle services on Solana in partnership with Securitize, enabling access to tokenized traditional financial assets like US Treasuries and credit products, the company announced on Wednesday. The integration, powered by Wormhole Queries, is aimed at providing Solana builders with price feeds for both traditional and crypto assets. Developers can now incorporate real-world assets (RWAs), such as Apollo’s $ACRED or BlackRock’s $BUIDL, into dApps. Discussing the launch, RedStone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak said the development represents a foundational shift in how tokenized RWAs are utilized on Solana. Rather than serving solely as static, tokenized instruments, RWAs can now be actively composed within DeFi protocols, enabling practical use cases that bridge traditional financial products with on-chain systems. “This is a foundational step in making RWAs not just visible but usable in DeFi on Solana,” said Kazmierczak in a statement. “It’s no longer just about tokenization — it’s about composability and unlocking use cases that merge traditional and onchain finance.” Securitize, which partners with major asset managers including Apollo, BlackRock, and VanEck, has chosen RedStone as the oracle provider for its tokenized products. The company said it has accumulated over $3.6 billion in tokenized assets under management. “We’re seeing the walls come down between TradFi and DeFi,” said Securitize’s Head of Credit and DeFi, Reid Simon. “The next evolution is about giving global institutions the tools to transact seamlessly across chains.” RedStone’s collaboration with Securitize, announced in March, helps enhance the usability of Securitize’s tokenized funds across DeFi platforms. RedStone delivers price feeds for these assets, enabling their integration into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms, with cross-chain capabilities on networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Earlier this month, RedStone’s $ACRED feed was successfully deployed in a Morpho vault on Polygon, one of the first live DeFi vaults to integrate a major RWA. The Solana expansion could enable similar products to reach a wider audience, from retail to institutional users. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Instant messaging app Telegram has signed a deal with Elon Musk's xAI to integrate the Grok AI service within the app. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, revealed on X, that the two companies agreed to a 1-year partnership that would see Telegram receive $300 million in cash and equity from xAI, in addition to 50% of revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Telegram. "Together, we win!" Durov wrote. The deal comes as Telegram looks to raise $1.5 billion via a bond offering that is being backed by the likes of BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel. The proceeds of the raise will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021. The messaging giant has 1 billion customers and reported a $540 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024. The TON token, the native token of the TON Network that was developed by Telegram, is now up by 18.5% over the past 24 hours after starting to surge two hours before the announcement was made. The move continued after the announcement, rising from $3.28 to $3.55.

Title: Nvidia, AMD Could Stand To Gain Big Time As Japan Proposes $7 Billion Chip Deal In Trump Tariff Talks Amid China Export Curbs: Report

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/28/2025 5:11:30 AM PDT by RoosterRedux Japan is reportedly planning to import nearly $7 billion worth of U.S.-made semiconductors in a move that could significantly benefit chipmakers like Nvidia Corporation amid ongoing trade negotiations with the Donald Trump administration. What Happened: Japan has proposed purchasing up to 1 trillion yen ($6.94 billion) in U.S. semiconductor products, reported Reuters via Asahi newspaper, which cited unidentified sources. The Japanese government would subsidize domestic companies that purchase the American chips, the report said. The plan is designed to help reduce the U.S.'s approximately 10 trillion yen trade deficit with Japan. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit the U.S. around May 30 for a fourth round of trade discussions, the report added. Why It's Important: Last month, shares of Nvidia and AMD encountered renewed pressure after the U.S. government imposed new restrictions on AI chip exports to China and several other areas. China continues to be a key market for Nvidia, with it contributing 13% of its revenue in the last fiscal year. However, CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year said that the company's market share in China has dropped sharply, from 95% prior to 2022 to just 50% now. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

Title: Nvidia, AMD Could Stand To Gain Big Time As Japan Proposes $7 Billion Chip Deal In Trump Tariff Talks Amid China Export Curbs: Report

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/28/2025 5:11:30 AM PDT by RoosterRedux Japan is reportedly planning to import nearly $7 billion worth of U.S.-made semiconductors in a move that could significantly benefit chipmakers like Nvidia Corporation amid ongoing trade negotiations with the Donald Trump administration. What Happened: Japan has proposed purchasing up to 1 trillion yen ($6.94 billion) in U.S. semiconductor products, reported Reuters via Asahi newspaper, which cited unidentified sources. The Japanese government would subsidize domestic companies that purchase the American chips, the report said. The plan is designed to help reduce the U.S.'s approximately 10 trillion yen trade deficit with Japan. Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit the U.S. around May 30 for a fourth round of trade discussions, the report added. Why It's Important: Last month, shares of Nvidia and AMD encountered renewed pressure after the U.S. government imposed new restrictions on AI chip exports to China and several other areas. China continues to be a key market for Nvidia, with it contributing 13% of its revenue in the last fiscal year. However, CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year said that the company's market share in China has dropped sharply, from 95% prior to 2022 to just 50% now. (Excerpt) Read more at benzinga.com ...

Title: Rocket Lab to Acquire Geost in Strategic Expansion into Satellite Payloads
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_to_Acquire_Geost_in_Strategic_Expansion_into_Satellite_Payloads_999.html
Time Published: 2025-05-28T12:05:09Z
Full Content:
Geost, based in Tucson, Arizona, has a two-decade track record supporting both classified and unclassified missions with EO/IR sensors. These systems are integral to missile warning, surveillance, reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness. The acquisition aligns with U.S. Department of Defense initiatives aimed at developing resilient space infrastructure, such as the Golden Dome architecture and the Tracking Layer from the Space Development Agency. Bringing Geost's payload technologies under Rocket Lab's umbrella enables the company to deliver more integrated spacecraft systems tailored for defense. This vertical integration is expected to reduce cost and risk while accelerating delivery timelines. Geost's sensor technologies will support real-time threat detection and situational awareness for military operations in contested space environments. The move adds Optical Systems to Rocket Lab's capabilities and further establishes the company as a disruptive force in the national security space sector. CEO Sir Peter Beck emphasized Rocket Lab's founding vision to challenge the status quo, stating: "With the acquisition of Geost, we're bringing advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads in-house to support secure, responsive, and cost-effective systems at scale." Bill Gattle, Geost General Manager and CEO of Lightridge Solutions, noted that the acquisition is a strategic fit, adding: "By bringing high-performance optical technologies in-house, Rocket Lab is strengthening its ability to deliver responsive, full-stack solutions for government and commercial missions." Rocket Lab will also acquire Geost's production assets, labs, and facilities in Arizona and Virginia, along with intellectual property and inventory. Geost's 115 employees will join Rocket Lab's growing team, expanding its global workforce to over 2,600 across multiple U.S. states, Canada, and New Zealand.

Messaging platform Telegram is raising at least $1.5 billion through a new bond offering. The firm is raising the funds through a five-year bond with a 9% yield, which has drawn interest from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel, the Wall Street Journal reports citing sources with the deal. The proceeds will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021, due next March. The new bonds are convertible into equity at a discount if Telegram goes public. Telegram originally developed layer 1 network TON, before making it an independent operation. In April, tokenization firm Libre said it plans to tokenize $500 million worth of Telegram debt on TON as Telegram Bond Fund (TBF). Read more: Telegram’s TON Takes On Real World Assets With Libre’s $500M Tokenized Bond Fund Telegram reportedly has over 1 billion monthly active users and 15 million paid subscribers, having doubled the figure in one year according to Durov. Financially, the firm turned a corner in 2024, reporting a $540 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue, up from a $173 million loss in 2023, the WSJ wrote. It projects a profit of more than $700 million for 2025. Telegram has grown its revenue by expanding its ad business and introducing features like in-app digital gifts and a platform for developers to build apps and bots.

Title: An Amazon exec says junior developers have the most to gain from AI, not the most to lose
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ai-leader-rory-richardson-junior-developers-jobs-coding-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-28T11:50:20Z
Full Content:
Tech leaders have been warning that AI is coming for junior developer jobs, but one Amazon executive says entry-level engineers shouldn't be worried — and they might actually have the most to gain. Rory Richardson, director of go-to-market for generative AI at Amazon Web Services, said that AI is leveling the playing field between junior and veteran developers. "A lot of studies that we're seeing as far as the impact of generative AI on this particular population is about getting your most junior noobs more performant," she said on an episode of the "Digital Disruption" podcast that aired Tuesday. AI tools that use natural language make it easier for early-career developers to learn and contribute, Richardson said. "I don't see anyone being left behind in this, mainly because it's so darn easy to use," Richardson said. "It's not like you have to learn a new programming language. It's all through natural language." She sees the biggest shift coming for newcomers rather than veteran developers. "It's opening the aperture of who's going to be able to relate to the technology," Richardson added. Richardson's optimism stands out in an area where layoffs have been widespread and job postings for software engineers are down more than a third from five years ago. This month, Google's Jeff Dean said AI may perform at a junior coder's level "within the next year-ish." Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicts "95% of code is going to be AI-generated" within five years, while Anthropic's Dario Amodei expects AI to be writing "essentially all of the code" by next year. Richardson instead sees AI as changing what entry-level developers do, rather than replacing them. She compared it to when graphing calculators reshaped database administrator jobs. "We're gonna see that same shift within all of our job families, I think, over the next two years," she said. "What they actually do is probably going to change as well, meaning you're going to not see this area as just a cost center that you have to maintain old code." Richardson said that when her kid is applying for a job in 2027, they probably wouldn't relate to computer language in the same way. "But the role of invention, context switching, synthesis, those higher-order ideas that make humans super valuable are going to be even more valuable," she said. The real risk, Richardson said, isn't being too junior but refusing to adapt. "Grit, creativity, those are those are still very important, the most human things possible," she said.

Jio BlackRock Asset Management has secured approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to initiate its mutual fund operations in India. This development allows the firm to operate as an investment manager, targeting both retail and institutional investors within the Indian market. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more In 2023, BlackRock and JFSL announced a 50:50 joint venture (JV), Jio BlackRock, leveraging the strengths and brands of both companies.

Title: Telegram to raise $1.5B in bond sale, Citadel joins BlackRock in backing the deal: WSJ
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/telegram-bond-issue-commercial/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T10:15:01Z
Full Content:
Share this article Telegram, the popular messaging platform, is preparing to issue at least $1.5 billion in new bonds on Wednesday, having secured commitments from both new investors, including Citadel, and established bondholders such as BlackRock and Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported early Wednesday. The bond will have a 5-year term at a 9% yield, according to the report. Proceeds from the bond offering will be used to buy back Telegram’s 2021 bonds, which mature in March 2026. About $400 million of that earlier debt has already been repurchased. Investors will have the option to convert their debt into shares at a discount if Telegram pursues a public offering, though an IPO appears unlikely in the near term. The deal signals that investors remain confident in Telegram’s financial trajectory and user growth, despite legal uncertainty around its founder, Pavel Durov. Durov has faced preliminary charges in France for allegedly refusing to cooperate with investigations into illegal activity on the platform. After being detained and investigated in France last year, in March, Durov was granted permission by an investigating judge to temporarily leave France. In a statement post-return to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where Telegram’s headquarters and operations are located, he stated that Telegram has not only met but also exceeded legal expectations in moderation, cooperation, and crime prevention. Ahead of the bond offering, Telegram reported a $540 million profit in 2024, according to the Financial Times, which cited a company presentation shared with potential investors. The profit marked a sharp turnaround from a $173 million loss the previous year, with revenue soaring to $1.4 billion, driven largely by premium subscriptions, advertising, and partnerships tied to the Ton blockchain ecosystem. The announcement sparked a rally in Toncoin (TON), the crypto asset tied to The Open Network, which climbed 6% to nearly $3.2 shortly after the news, according to CoinGecko data. TON has previously shown a quick reaction to developments involving Telegram and its CEO. Last August, the token plunged 18% following Durov’s arrest, only to rebound after his release. Also on Wednesday, the TON Foundation announced it had appointed former Visa executive Nikola Plecas as vice president of payments to lead its global payments strategy. Plecas will focus on enhancing payment capabilities within The Open Network (TON) and managing partnerships, particularly involving TON and Telegram, while also overseeing compliance.

When Microsoft (MSFT) pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month and a Wells Fargo (WFC) report suggested Amazon (AMZN) Web Services was reconsidering some leases, market watchers quickly diagnosed the symptoms: AI bubble concerns, demand uncertainty, and the inevitable cooldown after years of breakneck expansion. There was just one problem with that analysis: The companies building these data centers say it’s wrong. Rather than signaling doubt about AI’s future, recent data center adjustments by Amazon and Microsoft reflect an industry confronting harsh realities: power grids that take years to expand, land speculators inflating prices sixfold, and utilities overwhelmed with requests for more electricity than actually exists. The question isn’t whether AI infrastructure demand is real — it’s whether the real estate market and power grid can handle what’s coming. A focus on each lease update from the tech giants reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the data center market operates, said Andy Cvengros, a 20-year data center industry veteran at JLL (JLL) who represents major tech companies in their real estate deals. Unlike typical real estate deals, hyperscalers work with the same partners across multiple markets and treat their portfolios holistically. That means cancellations in one location often coincide with expansions elsewhere. Moreover, the massive scale and long timelines involved make these adjustments routine business rather than strategic retreats. “This stuff happens all the time,” Cvengros said. “Whereas two years ago, nobody followed any of this.” Cvengros said that 75% to 85% of new data center capacity through 2029 is already pre-leased. These aren’t tentative commitments from struggling startups, but contracts with investment-grade hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon planning to spend more than $300 billion this year alone. The tech CEOs also reject the retreat narrative. Amazon’s Andy Jassy recently told shareholders they would be “very happy” with the company’s $100 billion AI infrastructure spending. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella dismissed data center adjustments as routine business that simply gets more attention now. “We’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build all through the last 10, 15 years,” Nadella said on an earnings call. “It’s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter-over-quarter nowadays.” That aligns with what Cvengros sees on the ground. Rather than pulling back, hyperscalers are “pausing to re-architect their strategy, ultimately to come back and continue doing what they’re doing in a large way,” he said. “We have not seen them slow down by any means.” The real constraint isn’t wavering demand but basic infrastructure. Power grids across the country are struggling (or failing) to keep up with AI’s explosive energy requirements. The scale of the challenge is unprecedented. In 2023, data centers consumed more than 4% of American electricity, and that could rise to 12% by 2028, according to the Department of Energy. New facilities are regularly requesting 500 megawatts or more — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes. In Virginia alone, the state’s largest utility has connected 75 new data centers since 2019, driving statewide electricity sales up 7% and prompting projections of 85% demand growth over the next 15 years. The tech industry is adjusting its buildout plans in response. “We are finding the best right sizing,” said Henrique Cecci, a Gartner (IT) analyst who tracks the data center market. Beyond infrastructure constraints, the data center sector is moderating its energy demand forecast, going from five- to six-fold growth expectations to a more realistic three- to four-times increase. “Nobody knows exactly how big AI is, but everybody agrees it’s a big thing,” Cecci said. The supply side tells a grimmer story. Utilities ordering necessary grid technology like combustion turbines today won’t receive them until 2029, according to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), an independent energy research institute. Traditional grid buildout takes four to seven years under normal circumstances, but supply chain bottlenecks have made the situation worse. Potential solutions are emerging. EPRI’s DCFlex project, launched last fall, is exploring how data centers can become grid resources rather than just consumers. “There is genuine interest in load flexibility among the data center community, particularly if it can reduce time to interconnect,” said Anuja Ratnayake, an emerging technologies executive at EPRI. The approach combines three flexibility elements: compute workloads that can shift timing, cooling systems that can modulate power use, and backup generators that can feed power back to the grid. Europe offers another model entirely. Vincent Weynandt of LuxConnect, Luxembourg’s government-backed data center operator, points to a more holistic approach that emphasizes sustainability from the start. “We try to be as sustainable as possible, but there needs to be willingness to invest in this kind of thinking,” he said. That planning approach contrasts with the reactive measures now emerging in the U.S., where some cities have imposed energy moratoriums and others have implemented new sustainability requirements from regulatory authorities. The restrictions reflect growing concern that data center growth is outpacing grid capacity and straining local power supplies. The difference in approaches reflects deeper philosophical divides, Weynandt said. “The U.S. always is a business approach first,” he said. “If I can squeeze like $1 more out of it, let’s take that dollar.” The pursuit of those extra dollars has fueled what JLL’s Cvengros calls the real bubble in data centers, and it has nothing to do with AI demand. “You have everybody and their mother trying to get in this data center game,” he said. “Whether it’s a farmer, somebody who owns land, private equity, or it’s a group who puts land under contract, they slap a power study on it, and then try to sell it for six times what it’s worth.” This frenzy has created a secondary market where developers acquire sites, add basic power studies, and flip them at massive markups. Each power study generates a formal request to utilities for grid capacity, creating an avalanche of applications. The situation has become so distorted that utilities now see 30 to 100 gigawatts of power requests in individual markets — far exceeding what’s actually available. The power crunch is forcing utilities to require massive upfront commitments. In markets seeing 30 to 100 gigawatts of power requests, companies must now put down deposits of $10 million to $30 million just to get in line for grid connections, Cvengros said. Those massive utility deposits aren’t just about power planning — they’re designed to reduce the speculation. “That is a bubble that will fall apart in the next 12 months, 24 months,” Cvengros said. Meanwhile, the hyperscalers with real business models continue their strategic building, working around the speculators when possible. They’re even buying entire neighborhoods, paying residents well above market rates to relocate. Cvengros recently helped a group acquire about 30 homes in one transaction, demolishing them to make room for data center expansion. This is happening more and more in core locations, such as Chicago’s Elk Grove Village, which are hitting the physical limits of where data centers could even fit. The solution isn’t retreat but expansion: Companies are moving outward to places like Illinois’ Yorkville and Aurora, or entirely new markets such as Columbus and Minneapolis. The industry has navigated major technological shifts before. When virtualization was introduced in the early 2000s, companies could suddenly consolidate dozens of physical servers into just a few machines, dramatically increasing efficiency. Data centers built in that era suddenly found themselves using only 10% to 20% of their footprint, Cvengros said. A similar adaptation could happen with AI infrastructure if efficiency improvements outpace usage growth. The emergence of vastly more efficient AI models like China’s DeepSeek has already prompted industry discussions about whether massive buildouts are necessary, with some companies reconsidering the scale of their planned expansions. But the technology’s trajectory suggests otherwise. Nvidia’s (NVDA) roadmap shows future server racks will consume 600 kilowatts each — a 30-fold increase from the 10-20 kilowatt standard that prevailed for the past two decades. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has signaled that while chips will be more efficient, they’ll also be more powerful and require more energy, telling the industry to start building for higher power demands now. The demand is also shifting toward inference — running AI models for end users — rather than just training them. Unlike training, which happens in intensive but limited bursts to build models, inference runs continuously every time someone uses ChatGPT, asks Siri a question, or gets AI-powered search results. This usage pattern could multiply exponentially if AI applications reach broader adoption, creating sustained rather than cyclical demand for computing power. The companies navigating this transition successfully will be those with real business models and deep pockets, not land speculators. “We’re nearing a 2% vacancy nationally,” Cvengros said, describing an extremely tight market where serious operators continue building while speculation gets shaken out. “I don’t necessarily see a bubble popping.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 2 trades BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder told us he's making to help generate almost 7% yield

It's been a particularly busy start to the year for BlackRock's bond chief, Rick Rieder — not that someone overseeing $3 trillion in assets has all that much spare time to begin with. The economic policy uncertainty that President Donald Trump has introduced has sent the bond market flailing in a way Rieder hasn't seen before. But the volatility isn't necessarily a bad thing. "There is change afoot. One of the great things about investing in this environment is it's not static," Rieder told Business Insider. "The reaction function to any piece of news can be really extreme," he added. "So markets go through these periods of illiquidity, and it just presents these great opportunities that, by the way, may only be there for 10 minutes, or an hour, or a day. But I've never seen markets move to such extremes." Rieder shared a few of those opportunities he's leaning into at the moment in his iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC), which yields 6.6% and has grown to $9 billion in assets since launching in May 2023. One of them is the front end of the yield curve, or short-duration Treasurys. Yields on the two-year note had dropped from 4.3% last year to 3.6% in April as investors started to price in as many as five rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But as rate-cut expectations have fallen, yields have risen back up to nearly 4%, making them more attractive. Front-end bonds also offer a hedge for economic volatility in the short term, allowing investors to clip a robust coupon without being locked in for too long. The long end of the curve, meanwhile, isn't acting as a recession hedge, Rieder said, with investors worried about inflation from tariffs and rising yields thanks to ballooning fiscal spending deficits. "I'd rather keep yield up and not have to worry about the volatility," Rieder said. "The long end is not a hedge," he added. "Its traditional offsetting risk function doesn't work today, and so until yields move significantly higher, I don't see any significant reason to own longer in interest rates." Long-end rates in Europe, however, are more attractive, Rieder said. He said he's betting on European B- and BB-rated high-yield bonds to deliver higher yields. This is because economic growth is slowing to a greater degree in Europe than in the US, and inflation is tamer, so the European Central Bank is likely to cut rates more aggressively. This has meant limited upside volatility for European rates. For example, while 10-year Treasury yields have surged from 3.99% to 4.43% since April 4, 10-year eurozone bond yields have been virtually flat, falling by just 3 basis points from 3.13% to 3.1%. When yields rise, bonds lose their value, and vice versa. "Taking some of your interest-rate risk in Europe versus the US — particularly versus long US — has been an exciting thing to be involved with," Rieder said. "Usually, US and European rates move together," he added. "Now you're seeing historic movements of European rates relative to the US, meaning European rates are much more stable." Plus, the dollar's weakness relative to the euro is icing on the cake. "Because of the cross-currency swap, you could buy Europe and you get a couple of percent of additional yield," Rieder said. To mitigate the downside risk of some of the higher-yield bonds in his portfolio, Rieder pairs them with high-quality assets like AAA collateralized loan obligations, he said.

Title: Govt To Hold High-Level Meet To Tackle Dark Patterns On Apps

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Union Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi will today address consumer concerns around dark patterns on e-commerce apps at a high-level stakeholder meeting in New Delhi. This meeting aims to identify more effective ways to tackle manipulative design practices used by digital platforms. Companies such as Amazon, Swiggy, Flipkart, Zomato, MakeMyTrip, Meta, WhatsApp, Ola, and Apple will attend the meeting. National Law Universities (NLUs) and Voluntary Consumer Organisations (VCOs) have also been invited to participate. The meeting comes nearly 18 months since the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued guidelines to curb deceptive user interface practices. Notified in November 2023, the guidelines identified 13 dark patterns, including basket sneaking, forced action, drip pricing, confirm shaming, and false urgency. Despite notified guidelines from the Government, many platforms have made few visible changes. On Swiggy, users still see a message claiming they saved Rs 9 on delivery. That message appears above a Rs 11.80 platform fee that is added quietly in the bill. The app also nudges users to buy a Swiggy One Lite subscription by promising 10 free deliveries for three months at Rs 15. These tactics rely on presentation and timing to influence decisions. Screenshot from Swiggy showing Rs.9 savings with free delivery, even as Rs 11.80 is charged as platform fee Screenshot from Swiggy prompting users to subscribe to Lite for Rs 15 to get 10 free deliveries for three months MakeMyTrip continues to use fare tiers like Regular and Premium. Phrases such as âYou are missing out on these benefitsâ encourage users to choose a more expensive option. The total cost builds up in stages, reflecting what the CCPA guidelines describe as drip pricing. Screenshot from MakeMyTrip showing tiered fare options like Regular and Premium Elsewhere, Zomato shows how much a user âsavedâ through its Gold membership, even though that discount comes from a paid subscription. A Rs 10 platform fee appears only at the final step before payment. Users are also prompted to donate Rs.4 to Feeding India, a non-profit initiative by Zomato that works to reduce hunger among underserved communities in India. While the donation is optional, it sits in the middle of the billing flow, making it easy to add without much thought. Screenshot showing âYou saved Rs 21 with Gold,â a Rs 10 platform fee added at checkout, and a prompt to donate Rs 4 to Feeding India These small nudges may seem harmless, but they add up. They may play on user hesitation, create confusion, or make it easier to spend without noticing. A study published in 2024 by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) Academy and UI/UX design agency Parallel helps put these design choices in context. The researchers examined more than 12,000 screens across 53 apps, and found that nearly every app studied (98%) contained at least one dark pattern, and each app showed an average of 2.7 such patterns. The study identified the following dark patterns as most prevalent in Indian apps: The CCPA had released the guidelines to curb deceptive user interface practices after public consultation, but it removed Clause 8 from the notified guidelines. This clause, which had appeared in the draft version, had stated that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, would apply in case of any guideline violations. This gap allows platforms to continue using dark patterns without facing legal consequences. While some may view these as common interface choices, they raise questions about how far design can go in guiding user behaviour before it becomes misleading. At the high-level stakeholder meeting held later in the day, Union Consumer Affairs Minister urged companies to conduct internal self-audits and proactively remove dark patterns from their platforms. âCompanies must not wait for the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to intervene. They should proactively recognise and remove these deceptive practices before notices are issued. This is not just regulatory compliance but itâs about building trust with your consumers,â the Minister said. Officials from the Department of Consumer Affairs highlighted a surge in consumer complaints about dark patterns on the National Consumer Helpline (NCH). They also showcased digital tools developed earlier through the Dark Patterns Buster Hackathon 2023 in collaboration with IIT-BHU. These include the Jagriti App, which enables consumers to report dark patterns; the Jago Grahak Jago App, which offers real-time safety scores for e-commerce links; and the Jagriti Dashboard, which generates analytical reports on platforms under the CCPAâs scrutiny. Officials also noted that companies who took the Safety Pledge on National Consumer Day 2024 are expected to uphold that commitment. They said that continued use of dark patterns infringes the pledge. The meeting brought platforms and regulators back to the table, but for users, it leaves a critical question unanswered: if companies are still relying on these design tricks 18 months after the guidelines were issued, what action will the government take next? The ASCI study confirmed that dark patterns are not one-off design quirks-they are systemic and widespread, especially in delivery and travel apps that continue to use tactics the government itself has labelled harmful. The guidelines offered a roadmap. The meeting reaffirmed the governmentâs commitment to consumer protection but whether that commitment translates into enforceable rules, legal action, or stronger penalties remains to be seen.

According to data from the platform (May 2024 – May 2025), Greek investors use Freedom24 to invest mainly in technology stocks (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA), but also fixed income (through REITs and ETFs), emphasizing diversification and protection from market volatility According to data from the platform (May 2024 – May 2025), Greek investors use Freedom24 to invest mainly in technology stocks (NVDA, AMD, META, TSLA), but also fixed income (through REITs and ETFs), emphasizing diversification and protection from market volatility. Among the most popular ETFs offered on the platform are VUAA and SXR8 (S&P 500), the domestic AETF.GR, as well as thematic ETFs linked to oil, bonds and volatility. Greeks are strengthening their investment profile by making an investment shift to foreign stocks with an emphasis on ETFs and technology, choosing stocks such as Nvidia, Meta, Tesla and Google that are among their main international choices. In the domestic market, they prefer Metlen, OPAP, National Bank, Jumbo, Piraeus, Motor Oil, Alpha Bank and PPC. However, data shows that participation in the domestic market remains limited, with only 30 million euros directed to Greek products out of a total turnover of 682 million euros of the platform, a fact that confirms the international orientation of the average Greek investor of Freedom24, who is on average 35 years old, active in investments, with a systematic monthly presence, steadily building his portfolios with a long-term perspective and not occasionally. As emphasized by George Karageorgos, Head of Representative Office in Greece, “our goal is to strengthen the investment culture in Greece. We warmly thank the 100,000 Greek investors for their trust. This is a milestone that confirms the dynamic development of the company in our country and the trust of Greek investors in modern, transparent and easy-to-use digital investment solutions. We are committed to continuing to innovate, offer reliable solutions and support investment progress in Greece.” The Freedom24 office in Greece began operations in 2021 and has grown from 3 to 16 people in the last two years. In 2024, the company recorded a 71.6% increase in its client base compared to the previous financial year, and its client funds reached 330 million euros. It is the first international investment platform with ATHEX membership, with healthy client growth and fully coordinated with the preferences of Greek investors. The Greek office’s plans include connecting as a representative with the parent company in Cyprus, with the aim of expanding its investment portfolio. At the same time, it plans to offer fund transfer and card linking services to portfolios. Freedom24 is the European subsidiary of Freedom Holding Corp., a NASDAQ-listed international investment group with operations in the US, Europe and Central Asia. The group serves 555,000 clients worldwide and has a market capitalization of 9 billion dollars. As a European-based retail broker, Freedom24 offers access to over 40,000 stocks, 1,500 ETFs and 800,000 options on US stocks on the largest exchanges in the US, Europe and Asia. The platform has been awarded with awards such as “Best Multi-product Broker” in Italy and “Best ETF Broker” in Portugal, while it has also received the gold medal “Champion of Service” in Germany for two consecutive years. Freedom24 continues to expand its network across Europe, with a physical presence in 10 countries, including Greece.

Title: Ad tech’s IPO dreams are stirring again – MNTN just made them look a bit more real

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead For ad tech bosses, the IPO dream is no longer just a late-night fantasy, it’s starting to look like a real possibility. “Look” being the operative word. Nothing’s guaranteed but there is momentum. MNTN’s splashy debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week didn’t just grab attention, it lit a signal flare. Priced at $16 a share on May 21, the company hit the market with a $1.2 billion valuation – right at the top of investor expectations. By Friday, it was already at $28. On Tuesday, it was around $26. “This could be a meaningful moment for the CTV advertising ecosystem, even if MNTN itself is still relatively small in the grand scheme of AdTech,” said Karsten Weide, principal and chief analyst at W Media Research. “They’ve got a few strong things going for them: the backing of Morgan Stanley gives the IPO some institutional credibility, and the cachet of Ryan Reynolds as chief creative officer continues to generate attention well beyond the industry bubble.” But as good as all this sounds for MNTN, its fate is far from sealed. At 16 years old, it’s a veteran in ad tech terms but one that’s trailing behind peers. The Trade Desk and Criteo had already crossed the billion dollar revenue mark by this point in their life cycles. MNTN, by contrast, is pulling in $225 million. “This [the IPO] is a big tell in the market that reinforces the idea that not all ad tech companies are equal in so far as the ones that are doing well are rooted in performance,” said Brian Mandelbaum, CEO of Attain, a consumer data platform focused on outcomes. Here’s a closer look at that tightrope walk, based on the company’s S-1 filing with the SEC. Since 2020, MNTN has posted a tenfold revenue jump and 769% customer growth, riding the momentum of CTV and performance-driven advertising. That’s impressive. But the gloss fades with a $32.9 million net loss in 2024. Yes, adjusted EBITDA came in positive at $38.8 million (up from $32.5 million the year prior), suggesting it’s still squeezing more out of operation, but it’s not enough to silence the skeptics. And skeptics there are. Questions around MNTN’s legacy, especially from its earlier SteelHouse chapter – and ongoing concerns about transparency haven’t gone away. In today’s ad tech market – where hype no longer sells itself – that kind of baggage could weigh heavy with institutional investors. For now, though, the market’s buying what MTNN’s selling – and that’s sending a clear signal to private equity firms. PE has long been the default exit for ad tech startups, typically offering seven to 10 times adjusted EBITDA. MNTN, by contrast, hit the public market trading at a staggering 32 times adjusted EBITDA – a multiple that puts it closer to The Trade Desk than a typical mid-market player. “This [the MNTN IPO] could put a spanner in the works when it comes to private equity investors’ plans for ad tech,” said former MNTN executive Dan Larkman, now CEO of CTV advertising partner Keynes Digital. “Even if it settles at 30 times EBITDA, that changes the PE firm’s view of trying to pay seven to 10 times EBITDA to much higher.” A recalibration of this magnitude could shift the entire trajectory for a swath of mid-sized ad tech firms. If public investors are once again willing to reward growth – especially in hotter corners of the market like CTV – the IPO window starts to look less like a last-ditch plan B and more like a viable, even preferable, way out. But only for those with the stomach for it. Going public is no cake walk. It’s a gauntlet of competing stakeholders, relentless scrutiny and virtually no margin for error. That’s why so few ad tech companies, notably The Trade Desk and Criteo, have truly stuck the landing. Still, if MNTN can handle the heat, hold the line and deliver in the quarters to come , it could change the calculus for others. After all, the risks are steep, but so is the upside. Just ask an unnamed ad tech CEO who recently relocated to New York to be closer to the action as they prepare to take their own shot at going public. “He [the CEO] told me as recently as last fall that the aim is to start that process in the near future,” said one ad exec who exchanged anonymity for candor on those plans. Then again, “in the near future” is vague enough to stretch from next quarter to next year. And that’s the tension: the return of the ad tech IPO is far from guaranteed. Solid business fundamentals don’t mean much when the markets they rely on are anything but. A choppy macroeconomic outlook, shaken by trade wars, shifting tariffs and global uncertainty, has consumer spending wobbling. When that happens ad dollars tend to follow. “MNTN isn’t about to challenge the big DSPs like DV360 or The Trade Desk,” said W Media Research’s Weide. “The functionality is much more streamlined by design for smaller advertisers, and might not be feature-rich enough for marketers at bigger advertisers. But where it could create pressure is among smaller demand-side players like StackAdapt or FreeWheel’s Beeswax.” Needless to say, if there’s a moment to make the leap, this might be it. There’s more maturity in the public market’s view of ad tech than there was a decade ago. Back then, hype outpaced clarity. Companies went public on arbitrage plays and fat margins on ad spend, with little transparency into how the sausage was made. The bubble burst, and the scars of rocky IPOs lingered. This time feels different. “Investors have a better handle on the market than they did back then, but I still don’t think they know how to value it properly,” said Keynes Digital’s Larkman. “Ad tech companies don’t own the full ecosystem the way Google or Meta do. They control just a piece of the infrastructure, which makes it harder for investors to understand where the value actually lies – and how to price it accordingly.” The 24-page pitch deck for Amazon’s demand-side platform is telling: it puts its off-Amazon’s ambitions in black and white. As the ceiling on sport sponsorship investment rises, room for non-standard approaches is also growing for a variety of brands. While summer might be a slower season, it’s an important time for brands and retailers to ensure they’ve still got customers’ attention.

Title: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has quietly funneled roughly $5 billion of its earnings into a mix of US businesses and government debt over the past two years. It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup. These aren’t small stakes. They’re big plays on what could be the next wave of tech growth in the US. In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures. (That’s on top of having more than 120 billion in… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) May 26, 2025 Based on reports, Tether has also built positions in several US‐based Bitcoin mining firms. It recently boosted its holding in Bitdeer to 21%, making it one of the top shareholders. On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. With $153 billion in USDT out there—about 60% of the total stablecoin supply—Tether still leads globally. But in the US and Europe, USDT has seen some exchange delistings over MiCA compliance worries. A homegrown coin may smooth those relations. Tether’s strategy isn’t without challenges. It faces calls for more transparency on its reserves and criticism over the use of USDT by bad actors. The company insists it works closely with law enforcement when criminal funds surface. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: ELV Class Action Lawsuit – Shareholders Should Contact Robbins LLP for Information About Leading the Class Action Against Elevance Health, Inc.

May 27, 2025 18:12 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, May 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024 and October 16, 2024. Elevance is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV) Failed to Disclose the Impact Medicaid Redetermination Would Have on its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the Medicaid redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. Defendants further reassured investors that “we’re intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook,” and that, while the Company was seeing an acuity mix shift in the Medicaid business, it was “nothing outside of the bounds of what we’ve expected and guided for.” In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. On July 17, 2024, the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” In response to these disclosures, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, from a closing price of $553.14 on July 16, 2024, to a closing price of $520.93 on July 17, 2024. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Elevance Health, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class are required to file their papers with the court by July 11, 2025. The lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.

Investors' renewed risk appetite on Tuesday boosted Nvidia shares—and those of several companies linked with the tech giant—a day before the company is slated to report earnings. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 3.2% amid a broad rally following President Donald Trump's weekend decision to postpone until early July a 50% tariff on European imports he first threatened on Friday. Consumer discretionary and tech stocks led Tuesday's rally, with small-cap and AI stocks performing particularly well. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) Shares of Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) jumped nearly 50% on Tuesday. The power semiconductor maker’s stock soared more than 150% on Thursday after the company announced it would supply power chips for Nvidia’s next-generation AI systems. Navitas entered Tuesday's session with a market cap of about $850 million. Shares of several other Nvidia affiliates—past and present—were sharply higher Tuesday. Coreweave (CRWV), in which Nvidia held a nearly $1 billion stake as of the end of March, soared more than 20% on Tuesday. The cloud computing firm's stock has more than tripled in value since debuting on the Nasdaq in late March. SoundHound AI (SOUN) gained 16%, putting the stock up nearly 400% since Nvidia disclosed an equity stake in February 2024. Nvidia divested from SoundHound in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a regulatory filing earlier this year.

Title: Wall Street rallies on Trump’s EU tariff delay

Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride created by President Donald Trump’s trade policies whipped back upward on Tuesday, this time because of a delay for his tariffs on the European Union. The S&P 500 leaped 2% in its first trading since Trump said Sunday that the United States will delay a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union until July 9 from June 1. The European Union’s chief trade negotiator later said on Monday that he had “good calls” with Trump officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by July 9. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2.5%. They more than recovered their losses from Friday, when Wall Street’s roller coaster dropped after Trump announced the tariffs on France, Germany and the other 25 countries represented by the European Union. Such talks give hopes that the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners that would keep global commerce moving and avoid a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time. “We focus on actions over words,” Jean Boivin and other strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said, “as economic constraints spur policy rollbacks.” Caution still remains on Wall Street, of course, even if the S&P 500 has climbed back within 3.6% of its record after falling roughly 20% below the mark last month. A worry is that all the uncertainty caused by on-again-off-again tariffs could damage the economy by pushing U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending and investments. Surveys have already shown U.S. consumers are feeling worse about the economy’s prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs. On Tuesday, though, optimism ruled. The stock market’s gains accelerated after a report released by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved by more in May than economists expected. It was the first increase in six months, and consumers’ expectations for income, business and the job market in the short term jumped sharply, though it still remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. About half the survey results came after Trump paused some of his tariffs on China. The rise in confidence was widespread, covering different age and income groups, according to the Conference Board. On Wall Street, Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S&P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It’s the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies that have grown so large that their stock movements dominate the rest of the market. Nvidia has been riding a tidal wave of growth created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, but it is also facing criticism that its stock price has shot too high. Informatica climbed 6% after Salesforce said it would buy the AI-powered cloud data management company in an all-stock deal valuing it at about $8 billion. Salesforce rose 1.5%. They were part of widespread gains across the U.S. stock market, where 93% of the stocks within the S&P 500 rose. One of the outliers was AutoZone, which fell 3.7% following a mixed report on its performance for the three months through May 10. Its profit fell short of analysts’ expectations, though its growth in revenue was stronger than expected. CEO Phil Daniele said both its DIY and commercial businesses did well domestically, but shifting moves in foreign-currency values put pressure on the retailer’s operations outside the United States. All told, the S&P 500 rose 118.72 points to 5,921.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 740.58 to 42,343.65, and the Nasdaq composite gained 461.96 to 19,199.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.44% from 4.51% late Friday. It had been rising last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government’s rapidly increasing debt. Yields had been climbing for bond markets around the developed world, particularly in Japan, where a recent auction of longer-term bonds found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan’s finance ministry sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market. In stock markets abroad, European indexes mostly rose, while Asian indexes were mixed. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo and rising stock graph are seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo NEW YORK :Traders in the options markets are bracing for industry-wide volatility when AI-chipmaker Nvidia reports results on Wednesday, with defensive options contracts on a major semiconductor ETF drawing heavy trading. For VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the largest semiconductors ETF with some $22 billion in assets, about 2.4 put options changed hands daily over the last 10 days against every call option traded, the most defensive the trading has been in about 10 months, according to Trade Alert data.

Title: S&P 500 rallies 2% as Wall Street responds to Trump delay of 50% EU tariffs

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Stan Choe, Associated Press Stan Choe, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride created by President Donald Trump’s trade policies whipped back upward on Tuesday, this time because of a delay for his tariffs on the European Union. The S&P 500 leaped 2% in its first trading since Trump said Sunday that the United States will delay a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union until July 9 from June 1. The European Union’s chief trade negotiator later said on Monday that he had “good calls” with Trump officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by July 9. READ MORE: U.S. consumer confidence bounces back after five straight months of declines amid tariff anxiety The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2.5%. They more than recovered their losses from Friday, when Wall Street’s roller coaster dropped after Trump announced the tariffs on France, Germany and the other 25 countries represented by the European Union. Such talks give hopes that the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners that would keep global commerce moving and avoid a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time. “We focus on actions over words,” Jean Boivin and other strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said, “as economic constraints spur policy rollbacks.” Caution still remains on Wall Street, of course, even if the S&P 500 has climbed back within 3.6% of its record after falling roughly 20% below the mark last month. A worry is that all the uncertainty caused by on-again-off-again tariffs could damage the economy by pushing U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending and investments. Surveys have already shown U.S. consumers are feeling worse about the economy’s prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs. On Tuesday, though, optimism ruled. The stock market’s gains accelerated after a report released by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved by more in May than economists expected. It was the first increase in six months, and consumers’ expectations for income, business and the job market in the short term jumped sharply, though it still remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. About half the survey results came after Trump paused some of his tariffs on China. The rise in confidence was widespread, covering different age and income groups, according to the Conference Board. On Wall Street, Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S&P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It’s the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies that have grown so large that their stock movements dominate the rest of the market. Nvidia has been riding a tidal wave of growth created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, but it is also facing criticism that its stock price has shot too high. Informatica climbed 6% after Salesforce said it would buy the AI-powered cloud data management company in an all-stock deal valuing it at about $8 billion. Salesforce rose 1.5%. They were part of widespread gains across the U.S. stock market, where 93% of the stocks within the S&P 500 rose. One of the outliers was AutoZone, which fell 3.7% following a mixed report on its performance for the three months through May 10. Its profit fell short of analysts’ expectations, though its growth in revenue was stronger than expected. CEO Phil Daniele said both its DIY and commercial businesses did well domestically, but shifting moves in foreign-currency values put pressure on the retailer’s operations outside the United States. All told, the S&P 500 rose 118.72 points to 5,921.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 740.58 to 42,343.65, and the Nasdaq composite gained 461.96 to 19,199.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.44% from 4.51% late Friday. It had been rising last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government’s rapidly increasing debt. Yields had been climbing for bond markets around the developed world, particularly in Japan, where a recent auction of longer-term bonds found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan’s finance ministry sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market. In stock markets abroad, European indexes mostly rose, while Asian indexes were mixed. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

The $65 billion Dutch pension fund PME is reportedly warning US money managers not to abandon their “basic principles of stewardship” during the Trump era. According to a new Bloomberg report, PME says US money managers are allegedly risking significant business by “caving into pressures” from President Donald Trump’s administration by abandoning basic principles of responsible investing. Says Daan Spaargaren, PME’s senior strategist for responsible investing, “[US money managers] aren’t condemning what Trump is doing and how he is operating and how he is handling issues like climate change and demolishing the judiciary. We are worried about that.” The PME warns America’s investment industry that a Trump capitulation is prompting it to think twice about its US investments. The PME is reconsidering its $5.7 billion mandate with BlackRock Inc., after the world’s largest asset manager withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. A decision from PME is expected within weeks. Spaargaren says Trump’s actions that are raising concerns include attacking judges, countering America’s move to cleaner energies and the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. “[If asset managers] align their interests and their policies with the current administration in the US, then we are legitimizing also these steps and these practices by offering them our funds.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Why Nvidia Is a Morgan Stanley 'Top Pick' Ahead of Earnings

Morgan Stanley named Nvidia (NVDA) its "top pick" among semiconductor stocks Tuesday, a day before the chipmaker's expected earnings release, despite near-term concern over sales to China. The bank's analysts on Tuesday said potential issues that might trouble investors—like the impact of the Trump administration's ban on the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China—are "well telegraphed" and the "path to a [second-half] re-acceleration is clear." Nvidia has said it expects to face a $5.5 billion charge related to the tightened export controls. The bank affirmed its "overweight" rating and $160 price target, which implies a roughly 22% upside over the stock's closing level last Friday. The analysts said they are "not buying the stock for the [quarter] explicitly, but buying it for what we believe is coming." The impact of tighter export restrictions on China is softened by demand growth in the Middle East, Wedbush Securities analysts said Tuesday. Earlier this month, Nvidia announced a deal to supply chips to a Saudi Arabian startup and reportedly is involved in a deal allowing UAE to import advanced American-made chips. AI spending from Saudi Arabia and UAE "could help fill the void left by this near-term China uncertainty in Nvidia's future business" and potentially add $1 trillion to the global AI market in the coming years, the Wedbush analysts said. Wedbush's price target for Nvidia is $175, which—unlike Morgan Stanley's—is above the Visible Alpha analyst consensus approaching $164. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 3% to $135.53 in recent trading Tuesday to move into slightly positive territory for the year.

Title: 2 reasons BlackRock sees upside ahead for one beaten-down corner of the stock market

US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise. Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space. First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever. "The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs," BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand." In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024. Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks. "Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth," BlackRock wrote. "Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think." BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth. "Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers," BlackRock wrote. "But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: 'Full hit from China': Analysts are staying bullish on Nvidia ahead of earnings, but tariffs loom large

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges."

Shares were trading around $137 a share. The stock is up nearly 2% year-to-date, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 0.5% gain. Nvidia announced a partnership with Saudi tech firm Humain on May 13 to strengthen sovereign AI infrastructure and elevate the country's position as an AI developer. The chipmaker's stock surged to its highest valuation since February following the announcement. Nvidia said in an announcement that the first phase of the 500 megawatt buildout will be a deployment of 18,000 Nvidia GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips. Nvidia defines "sovereign AI" as a nation's capability to produce AI with its own resources, the chipmaker wrote on its website. It's an area that Huang has emphasized multiple times. "It codifies your culture, your society's intelligence, your common sense, your history — you own your own data," Huang at the World Governments Summit in Dubai last year. — Ana Altcheck Huang announced at the tech show Computex on May 19 that Nvidia is looking at the Beitou Shilin area in northern Taipei for a new Nvidia office named "Nvidia Constellation." Taipei's mayor Chiang Wan-an, who showed up at Huang's keynote, said in an interview following the announcement that the city government welcomes the chipmaker's office and will provide assistance as needed. Huang, who was born in Taiwan, also announced a partnership with TSMC to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan. The project will be a joint effort between the Taiwanese government and Taiwan manufacturing firm Foxconn. — Ana Altchek At GTC this year, Jensen Huang announced plans for Nvidia to build a quantum research lab in Boston. "It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world," Huang said. "And it's going to be located in Boston so that we can partner with Harvard and MIT." Wednesday's earnings call is the company's first since the announcement, and the quantum sector has been booming. Some notable startups include D-Wave, whose stock has risen over 138% in the last 30 days as of May 27; IonQ, whose shares have risen over 67% in the same timeframe; and Rigetti Computing, whose stock has increased by more than 53% in the last month. As tech giants, including Nvidia, expand their quantum offerings, investors are keen on tangible road maps for their progress in the burgeoning field. Expect to see those plans mentioned more often going forward. — Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert Angelo Zino, a senior equity strategist at CFRA Research, said the outlook for Nvidia had "considerably improved" in recent weeks, pointing to progress between the US and China in securing a framework trade deal and the US getting rid of its AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Nvidia's recent Saudi Arabia deal also gives the company "strategic importance" in the US's trade negotiations with other countries, Zino wrote in a note to clients. "We believe NVDA's content growth story in data centers will extend through at least 2027, supported by its product pipeline," Zino said. "While quarterly variability is a risk, we view any pullbacks as enhanced buying opportunities given the better policy backdrop/customer visibility," he added. It's the first earnings call for the company since US lawmakers said in April they were investigating how the Chinese AI company DeepSeek may have gotten Nvidia chips. House Representatives said in a report that it appeared DeepSeek had used 60,000 Nvidia chips even though US sanctions limited the sale of the company's tech in China. The lawmakers also accused Jensen Huang of directing the design of Nvidia chips to get around US export controls. The company said in a statement at the time that "the US government instructs American business on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter." — Kelsey Vlamis While earnings for Nvidia should be "fine" for the first quarter, guidance will likely be lowered in the second quarter to account for a hit to the company's revenue in China, analysts estimated. "With regard to the F2Q26 we are slightly lowering estimates to account for a full hit from China," the firm wrote in a note this month. Still, demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain on a solid trajectory in the coming years, the firm said, pointing to Nvidia's recent deal with Saudia Arabia. The research firm reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $150 a share, implying 11% upside from current levels. Nvidia's almost 25% share price jump this past month has come hand-in-hand with several announcements that place its chips at the center of vast new AI data centers. During a trip to Saudi Arabia this month, Jensen Huang revealed a deal to ship 18,000 of Nvidia's top chips to the country. Last week, the FT reported that Oracle will buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia for a US data center. Any sign that more deals are coming down the line could reassure investors that huge revenue growth in the chip giant's lucrative data center business is still achievable. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia's stock is up 25% in the last month. In an earnings preview note, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote that Nvidia's stock "has been running over the past few weeks" following an easing of AI restrictions by the US government and recent announcements of AI projects with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The analysts wrote that they don't expect these developments to help today's results or guidance for the current quarter. The main drag on earnings will likely come from the Trump administration's restriction on selling H20 chips to China. Still, the analysts expect quarter-on-quarter growth to be viewed positively by investors and that Nvidia's supply chain issues will be resolved. The networking business should also pick up, alleviating some investor concerns around potential market share loss in that sector, the analysts wrote in last week's note. — Shubhangi Goel Restrictions on chip sales in China will likely remain an "overhang" on Nvidia until new rules are implemented, analysts at DA Davidson wrote. New restrictions on chips sold in China could also come "any day," they added, despite the Trump administration recently rolling back Biden's AI diffusion rule. The firm reiterated its "neutral" rating on the stock and issued a $120 price target, which they said was dependent on factors like how regulation in China will shake out and if some of Nvidia's neocloud customers face borrowing challenges. The price target implies 11% downside from current levels. In April, President Donald Trump placed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China. The chipmaker said it expected a $5.5 billion write-down in its first-quarter earnings as a result of the new restrictions. During the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on May 21, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China dropped to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. He added that Chinese companies have benefited from US chip export rules, and they have been "a failure." The chipmaker is reportedly planning to begin mass production for a less powerful AI chipset for China at a lower price as early as June, Reuters reported on Monday. — Ana Altcheck Piper Sandler said it expects Nvidia to miss on revenue for the first quarter. That's due to uncertainties related to the US economy, tariffs, and the ban on its H20 chip in China. "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week," analysts wrote. Still, the firm sees Nvidia benefiting from a strong second half of the year. That's due to strong capital expenditures from other tech firms and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." The firm reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia and issued a $150 price target, implying 11% upside from current levels. A concern often raised by Nvidia investors is the small pool of customers it has depended on to generate billions of dollars in revenue. A handful of Big Tech firms have accounted for more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue as the AI boom has taken shape. But Nvidia has shown signs that its days of depending on West Coast tech firms may soon be over. Deals to sell its chips to nation states with plans to build sovereign AI capabilities have been picking up. Investors could look to get a clearer roadmap on plans to widen its customer base. — Hasan Chowdhury Nvidia should post a "modest" sales beat in the first quarter, but analysts at Bank of America said the company's guidance for the current quarter could be "messy. " They pointed to the impact of tariffs on Nvidia's shipments from China. The bank estimated that Nvidia could see a $4 billion to $5 billion headwind on shipments from China in the second quarter. Sales guidance for the second quarter could be revised down to $41 billion, down from the $46 billion consensus estimate. BofA estimated that Nvidia's total sales for the 2026 fiscal year could be around 6% below consensus, while earnings could be around 10% below consensus. "Despite these near-term headwinds, we maintain Buy on NVDA, a top sector pick given its unique leverage to the global AI deployment cycle and possibility for China sales recovery on new redesigned/compliant products later in the year," analysts wrote. The bank has a price target of $160 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Nvidia beat Wall Street's sales expectations in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday despite significant headwinds in China as the chip giant navigates trade restrictions. The company reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion. In its key data center segment, Nvidia saw revenue of $39.1 billion during the quarter, lower than analysts' expectations for $39.36 billion but up 73% year-over-year. Trading was volatile immediately after the results, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading to about $138.41. Shares were up 0.4% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, closing at $134.68. Nvidia didn't waste any time mentioning what was dragging down its sales for the quarter. In the second sentence of its earnings release, Nvidia detailed how much of an impact US export restrictions had on its business in China for the quarter. "As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished," the company wrote. The company had previously sold a less-powerful chip, the H20, in the Chinese market. "NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter," it added, with its gross margin taking around a 10% hit in the first quarter as a result. The company said its second-quarter guidance reflects a loss of around $8 billion in H20 revenue. Wall Street largely appeared to like what it heard on Nvidia's analyst call, however, with the stock trading up around 5% after CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress said the demand for AI inference had seen a "sharp jump" and customer commitments for its chips were "firm." Kress also spoke about the robust demand for the company's Blackwell chip. "Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue," Kress said. "Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter." The Nvidia execs fielded multiple questions on the call about the company's plans to navigate export restrictions in China. Huang said he trusts the President's vision for export controls — "the President has a plan," he said. However, he said that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang said. Earlier in the call, Huang didn't mince words about what he felt about the challenging situation. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang said. Scroll on for a play-by-play from Nvidia's analyst call. Huang closes out the call. Nvidia shares are trading up around 4.25% after hours. "AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the Internet, mobile, and cloud," Huang says. The CEO says "inference is exploding," and the company's Blackwell chip system is designed to "power the full AI lifecycle." Huang wraps up by mentioning Nvidia's upcoming tour in Europe and ends the call with, "see you in Paris." Huang says he trusts the President's vision for export controls, but that Nvidia's ability to innovate around the ban on H20 chips is limited at the moment. The existing restrictions on chips Nvidia can sell into China, "pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further," Huang says. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri asks if the company is working on another strategy for a compliant chip. Huang replies: "The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it." Huang says "agents are really quite successful" and much more "game-changing" than generative AI, setting up the path to success for enterprise AI. "Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and are able to problem solve and use tools and have memory," he says. The first positive surprise is the "exponential growth" in inference reasoning, Huang says. Huang mentions the rescinding of "AI diffusion" as the second positive surprise. He says the world is awakening to "the importance of AI as an infrastructure." Huang says the third surprise is "enterprise AI," and, more specifically, agentic AI. He says agents can understand "implicit instructions" and problem solve using tools and memory." Agentic AI is game-changing," Huang says. Lastly, Huang mentions "industrial AI." He says all of the new plants and factories are being created at the right time."Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," Huang says Huang says he's going to be "on the road next week through Europe," continuing his world tour for AI that's been going for the past several months. His latest trips include a visit to Beijing, meeting with Chinese officials and DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang — as well as his trip to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. During the call, he clearly explains his rationale: "Just about every country needs to build out its AI infrastructure." Nvidia's CEO says it has more Blackwell orders than it had at the company's GTC conference. He adds that Nvidia is increasing its supply chain and building it out. "We're building it here on shore, United States," Huang says. Nvidia's CFO breaks down the losses from H20 sales in China. Nvidia incurred a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 due to lost H20 revenue in China. The charge was associated with excess inventory of H20 and purchase obligations as demand for the chip slumped. That's $1 billion less than the chipmaker had predicted. However, the chipmaker was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in Q1. Nvidia's Q2 outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion — a huge number. Huang fields the first question, which is about demand for reasoning inference. Huang says, "We would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of It." Huang is making some forceful remarks about China out of the gate. "China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success," Huang says, adding that "the platform that wins China is positioned to lead" globally. Huang reiterates that the $50 billion Chinese market is currently closed off from the chipmaker due to US export restrictions. He says Hopper is no longer in option and it's taking "a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold for repurpose." Huang says China's AI will move on with or without Nvidia's chips. He says the question remains whether China's AI market will run on US platforms. "Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals," Huang says. The US should also make sure it stays ahead in open-source AI. "On DeepSeek — DeepSeek and QN from China are among the best open source AI models," the Nvidia CEO says. "Released freely, they gain traction acros the US, Europe and beyond.""America wins" when models like DeepSeek run best on "American infrastructure," Huang adds. Nvidia's autos revenue was down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year on year, year on year. "Growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NEVs, Kress says. "We are partnering with GM to build the next-gen vehicles, factories, and robots using Nvidia AI simulation and accelerated computing, and we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes Benz, starting with the new CLA hitting roads," she adds. And here's another reminder of Nvidia's roots. Amid all the AI talk, Nvidia still remains a power player in the gaming industry. The company reports a record $3.8 billion revenue for the quarter, up 48% from the last quarter. The CFO says Nintendo's upcoming console, the Switch 2, uses Nvidia's neural rendering and AI tech. Kress says Nintendo has shipped 150 million consoles to date. Kress says Nvidia's China data center revenue was "slightly below" expectations due to H20 export restrictions. "For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue," the CFO says. Nvidia CFO Kress says the company has "a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of Nvidia AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future." That's roughly the energy output of about 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia shares are trading up over 5% after hours as Kress continues her prepared remarks. Nvidia's CFO says the chipmaker is seeing a "sharp jump in inference demand." Kress said OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are experiencing a "leap in token generation." She says Microsoft, for example, processed more than 100 trillion tokens in Q1, which is a fivefold increase year-over-year. The "exponential growth" is representative of "strong demand for" AI services across Microsoft's platform, she adds. Kress starts by highlighting a "challenging" economic environment. However, she says Nvidia's customer commitments are "firm." "Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory," Kress says.Nvidia is evaluating its options in China, Kress adds. Losing the ability to sell its chip to China would materially impact Nvidia's business, the CFO says. "Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide," Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on the line. Huang and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress will give opening remarks before answering questions live from analysts. Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told BI that the results weren't as bad as some expected, given the recent China export restrictions. "Nvidia results were not as bad as feared considering the increased restrictions on selling into China," Luria said. "While revenue guidance for the second quarter was lower, it incorporates the increased restrictions." EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI that while Nvidia beat earnings expectations, the chipmaker is facing increasing challenges with maintaining market dominance. In addition to geopolitical tension, Nvidia is also facing pressure from rival chipmakers, like AMD, which has gained "ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads," Bourne said. He added that there are also broader concerns around trade tensions and looming tariffs creating headwinds for AI chip demand. "This doesn't signal an end to Nvidia's dominance," Bourne said. "But highlights that sustaining it will require navigating an increasingly complex landscape of geopolitical, competitive, and economic challenges."

Dominic Kohler, head of investment and client solutions at Brown Shipley, a Quintet Private Bank, reflects on the resilience of traditional assets, equities and bonds, amid inflation, volatility, and a new generation of investor expectations. Marked by rapid macroeconomic shifts, traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income are being tested like never before. According to Kohler, the investment landscape is one of complexity and opportunity where prudence, adaptability, and trust are more valuable than ever. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more “We have been navigating a challenging environment over the past couple of years,” Kohler notes. “High interest rates, sustained inflationary pressure, volatile markets and continued geopolitical uncertainty” have reshaped how traditional assets are perceived and deployed. For equities, Kohler stresses, “being more selective; quality and resilience matter more than ever.” On the fixed income side, the outlook has brightened. “Things are looking up again now that yields are more attractive.” This combination of cautious optimism and tactical flexibility underscores Brown Shipley’s broader approach. “It’s a market where careful positioning is key – with a focus on the long term whilst also looking for opportunities as and when they present themselves.” Even as inflation shows signs of cooling, Kohler maintains that preserving wealth remains a core priority especially for private clients seeking long-term stability. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Apart from capital appreciation, our investment philosophy also includes a focus on wealth protection,” he explains. “Even with inflation starting to ease, this remains key. Quality shares and government or corporate bonds remain reliable tools to help us deliver on our philosophy.” While new asset classes and financial innovations continue to emerge, Kohler believes in the continued importance of traditional investments. “We are convinced that – even with changing market conditions, new asset classes and product innovation – traditional assets will continue to play a key role.” Brown Shipley employs a flexible yet disciplined approach to asset allocation, allowing it to respond quickly to market developments without losing sight of long-term objectives. “We have a dynamic asset allocation approach,” Kohler explains. “We actively adjust our positioning as the market changes, always guided by our long-term outlook but responsive to short-term shifts.” During periods of heightened volatility, this might involve reducing exposure to riskier assets like equities and increasing allocations to higher-quality bonds. “Within equities, we lean towards sectors and companies that are better positioned to weather uncertainty,” he adds. “On fixed income, with yields now more attractive, bonds have become an effective tool not only for capital preservation but also income generation.” While traditional assets form the core of most portfolios, Kohler highlights the growing relevance of alternatives in achieving true diversification. “It’s all about finding the right mix,” he says. “Alternatives can help reduce risk, increase diversification and provide an illiquidity premium.” Private markets, in particular, are gaining traction especially with younger, more growth-oriented investors. However, Kohler offers a word of caution. “Private markets are complex and often poorly understood. Clear communication and positioning of the benefits – and risks – is therefore important.” Despite the rise of alternatives and digital investments, Kohler remains confident in the long-term performance potential of traditional assets. “We are focused on providing consistent risk-adjusted returns over the long term,” he says. “Traditional assets still have a strong role to play. They can offer stability and consistency, particularly when clients see uncertainty and risk in the market.” Moreover, risk management is central to Brown Shipley’s investment philosophy. Through its parent company, Quintet, the bank partners with BlackRock to gain access to cutting-edge risk assessment tools. “As part of our partnership with BlackRock, we utilise best-in-class risk management tools to stress-test portfolios and consider various market scenarios,” Kohler explains. But numbers alone aren’t enough. “It is critical that advisers are close to clients and understand what is most important to them – spending time with them and ensuring their strategy remains aligned to their investment objectives and personal circumstances.” Where geopolitical developments can move markets overnight, Kohler’s advice is to remain level-headed. “Whether elections, conflicts or tariff announcements, we look at how such events may affect markets and adjust portfolios as required,” he says. “However, as we have seen at the start of this year, it is key to filter out the noise – whilst it is important to seek out opportunities, sometimes standing firm in our positioning can be the best course of action in the long run.” Looking ahead, Kohler sees several forces reshaping the future of traditional investing from regulatory shifts and product innovation to the expectations of younger investors. “We are in the midst of the largest wealth transfer in history,” he says. “Younger investors have an increased focus on thematic and sustainable investing. We are continuing to evolve our product offering accordingly, providing clients more choices about how their wealth is managed and invested.” Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly front and centre. But Brown Shipley’s approach is personalised rather than prescriptive. “ESG is often about deeply held beliefs, reflecting the individual values of the families we serve,” Kohler explains. “That’s why we do not impose our values but rather offer our clients a wide range of choices so they can invest in alignment with their values.” Incorporating ESG, he notes, is also a matter of sound investing. “Investors are constantly seeking to limit their investment universe by excluding poorly run or excessively risky companies. Incorporating ESG metrics is an attempt to evaluate and avoid risk – and identify opportunities – based on factors not always associated with investment decisions in the past.” While the human relationship remains at the core of client service, technology is playing an increasingly important role in portfolio construction and management. “Technology helps us make more informed decisions faster,” Kohler says. “We have a number of key partnerships that have given us access to market-leading technology that our clients benefit from as they feed into our internal processes and decision-making.” Still, he adds, “human interaction and judgement remain essential.” Traditional assets continue to offer a solid foundation for wealth preservation and growth. For Brown Shipley, it’s not just about selecting the right stocks or bonds, it’s about building long-term trust, leveraging innovation responsibly, and staying anchored to what matters most to clients. As Kohler puts it: “With the right allocation and solid instrument selection, traditional assets can continue to deliver superior long-term returns.”

Title: Piper Sandler Warns Of The “Last Wave Of Negative News” Ahead Of NVIDIA’s Pivotal Q1’25 Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA shares have been firmly pegged on a dizzying roller-coaster ever since DeepSeek released its R1 model back in January, having contended with peak AI fears, a full-fledged global war and the ensuing rapid de-escalation, and the fallout from the ongoing decoupling between the US and China. Yet, NVIDIA seems to have emerged from these Sisyphean obstructions relatively unscathed, and is on the cusp of clearing its last remaining negative catalysts for the year, as per a new investment note from Piper Sandler. To wit, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar has reiterated an 'Overweight' rating and $150 share price target for NVIDIA, while noting: "All in all, we think that NVDA is poised to be flat to down into the print this week. We think that April quarter is poised for a miss in revenues largely from macro uncertainty and from the H20 ban." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the Trump administration recently imposed licensing requirements on NVIDIA's China-specific H20 GPUs, which is expected to translate to a $5.5 billion inventory-related charge in Q1. As per an estimation by Susquehanna analysts, these licensing requirements cost NVIDIA $1 billion in China-related sales over the last three weeks of the company's April-ending quarter. For the rest of the year, these lost sales are likely to amount to $3.5 billion per quarter. What's more, the H20-related write-downs might depress NVIDIA's margins by 11 percentage points to 67.7 percent in Q1, as per an analysis by Wedbush. Last week, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang declared that his company had walked away from $15 billion in potential annual sales in China following the imposition of licensing requirements. Concurrently, Huang predicted that the market for AI GPUs in China would swell to $50 billion in 2026. Of course, NVIDIA has been working on a China-specific, watered-down version of its Blackwell GPUs to comply with existing US export controls. However, given Washington's mercurial temperament towards all things China-related, the world's second-largest economy remains a persistent point of concern for NVIDIA. Coming back, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar believes NVIDIA's new China-specific Blackwell GPU will only launch in the latter half of its July-ending quarter. Kumar also believes that the factors responsible for NVIDIA's underperformance in Q1 are largely "outside" its control. The analyst goes on to note: "Despite this, we see a strong back half of the year given HPC capex coming on strong coupled with macro forces improving driven by sovereign investments following the announcements of several large deals over recent weeks." Kumar ends his note with solid advice: "We advise investors to weather the uncertainty and stay long the stock as this is likely largely the last wave of negative news for NVDA this year." Of course, while Piper Sandler appears cautious heading into NVIDIA's Q1 earnings print on Wednesday, Lynx Equity is anything but, boldly declaring that the stock could break out to new highs. "After a couple of quarters of inline results, we think NVDA has the potential to provide upside to muted investor expectations." Lynx Equity also took pains to note the resurgence of CoWoS capacity build at TSMC, which strongly suggests recovery in NVIDIA's supply chain. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: ETFs’ impact on Bitcoin – Is the classic bull-bear cycle over?

BTC’s cycle is becoming less predictable – Are ETFs and institutions changing the rules? The typical bull-bear Bitcoin [BTC] cycle may be facing a structural shift, according to DeFi analytics platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock). During previous cycles, Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTH) accumulated during bear markets and unloaded later during bull runs (mostly halving). This helped form the typical bowl-shaped (red) patterns on the crypto’s on-chain charts. Source: Sentora/X However, the current cycle has been different and confusing even to seasoned BTC cycle analysts, noted the analytics firm. “This time, however, the script is different: distribution kicked off much earlier, has unfolded in a slower, stop-start fashion, and shows none of the clean, symmetrical rhythm we’ve come to expect.” Most analysts have linked the perceived cycle changes to a greater number of institutions embracing BTC. Especially after the approval of U.S Spot ETFs in early 2024. In fact, CryptoQuant founder Ji Young Ju shared a similar outlook after making a wrong bear market call in early 2025, only for BTC to hit a new all-time high two months later. He said, “It feels like it’s time to throw out that cycle theory. New liquidity sources and volume are becoming more uncertain, signalling a transition as the Bitcoin market merges with TradFi.” Despite the aforementioned changes in demand and supply dynamics, the present cycle (epoch 5) has been closely trailing the third (blue) and fourth (green) cycles. Worth pointing out, however, that it slightly diverged in January 2025. Source: Glassnode Since the last April halving, Bitcoin has rallied by over 70%, rising from $63k to over $109k. However, over the same period, the past cycles saw much higher returns. In the 2020-2021 cycle (epoch 4), BTC pumped by 354% while in 2017 (epoch 3, blue), the asset gained by over 500%. When the returns were zoomed out on a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) basis, it revealed a steady decline. The 4-year BTC cycle CAGR dropped from over 850% in 2015 to about 30% in May 2025. In short, annual investor returns have shrunk over the years – A move some have linked to BTC’s “asset maturity” status as TradFi embraces it. This thesis can also be supported by easing volatility (price swings). Source: The Block Since the debut of U.S Spot ETFs, annualized BTC volatility (30-day) has dropped from 78% to 35% – A sign that the asset became relatively less volatile from early 2024. When zoomed out from 2017, its volatility has been trending southwards, indicating that BTC has become more mature. Further adoption by institutions may make it even more like stocks or gold. Going forward, BTC’s massive upside potential may diminish. Despite it being the best asset on a risk-adjusted basis, compared to most traditional investments.

May 27, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, May 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Trump's relationship with Apple in souring

The president floated a 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the U.S. on Friday, adding that Apple (AAPL-0.39%) would foot the bill. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,” President Trump said in a TruthSocial post on Friday morning. Shares in Apple were down almost 4% by market open. The threat followed a report by the Financial Times that Foxconn (HNHPF-1.69%), Apple’s supplier, would spend $1.5 billion on a plant in India for iPhones. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during business roundtable in Qatar last week. I said to him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Cook was absent from the president’s Middle East tour, which was attended by Big Tech’s leaders. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Trump said to Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang at an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The spat over Apple’s plans for Indian manufacturing marks a shift in Trump and Cook’s relationship, as the pair have historically been close allies. The president mistakenly called the CEO “Tim Apple” in 2019. That same year, the president told reporters that Cook is a “great executive because he calls me and others don’t.” Cook even donated $1 million of his personal money to Trump’s inauguration. On top of that, Apple committed to spend more than half a trillion dollars in the U.S over the next four years, with a focus on boosting domestic manufacturing, winning an exemption from April’s “reciprocal” tariffs. That exemption has since been made temporary, however. The possible 25% tariff comes at a bad time for Apple. It’s is the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, dropping 22%.

Title: BTC reclaims $110k as Trump Media announces $2.5B Bitcoin treasury

Trump Media and Technology Group, a Donald Trump-linked company that’s publicly traded in the US, has announced it’s raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin price, which had hovered around $109k before the news, jumped to above $110,000 as bulls looked to reclaim the upper hand. The news comes as Bitcoin 2025, a major Bitcoin conference, begins in Las Vegas, with Trump sons Eric and Trump Jr expected as speakers. Nasdaq and NYSE Texas-listed Trump Media, trading under the ticker DJT, is the operator of Trump’s social media app Truth Social as well as streaming platform Truth+ and financial technology firm Truth.Fi. On Tuesday, the company revealed plans to raise $2.5 billion from 50 institutional investors, with subscription agreements targeting $1.5 billion of Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes. The funds raised from this private placement offering will close on May 29, 2025. According to the announcement, the proceeds of the offering will be used to adopt a Bitcoin treasury. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions,” said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and chairman of Trump Media. Adding Bitcoin to the Trump family-owned company’s balance sheet will see it join other publicly-traded companies that now hodl billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. The biggest player in this corporate frenzy for BTC is Strategy, which has amassed over $40 billion in BTC since first buying it in 2020. The surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also seen BlackRock gobble up thousands of BTC as inflows mount. Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital are Trump Media’s custody providers as it embarks on this BTC treasury venture. Other companies to help TMTG are Yorkville Securities and Clear Street as co-lead placement agents, and Cantor Fitzgerald as financial advisor. Bitcoin price changed hands around $110,065 at the time of writing, just 1.7% off its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, 2025.

Title: The luxury housing market is cracking — and tech-heavy cities are getting hit hardest
URL: https://qz.com/luxury-home-prices-jumbo-mortgages-economic-uncertainty-1851782446
Time Published: 2025-05-27T14:39:00Z
Full Content:
Luxury home sales fell 10% in April from a year earlier, according to new data from Redfin (RDFN+0.64%). While prices remain near record highs — with the median sale hitting $1.35 million, up nearly 7% since 2024 — beneath the surface, demand is cracking. The 10% drop in sales makes for the steepest decline since 2023 and the lowest April level in over a decade. Rising prices and rates on jumbo mortgages stubbornly stuck near five-year highs help to explain the sales decline. But this isn’t just a housing story. It’s a broader signal. For years, wealthy Americans bought the dip and shrugged off volatility. Now, they’re blinking. Evidence from the housing market and beyond suggests that the top 5% of U.S. households are growing skittish. Consider the location of the steepest declines — San Francisco, an extraordinarily tech-heavy market, but with its own finance-sector presence, too. Since 2022, nearly 500,000 tech workers have been laid off as major tech companies and smaller players have quietly offshored high-paying roles, from engineers to product managers. Even Walmart (WMT+0.77%) is trimming corporate headcount — not out of desperation, but arguably because it can. The Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.90%) recently captured the new mood in boardrooms: “Everybody’s replaceable.” Such attitudes are likely to particularly affect white-collar workers in the wealthiest 5% who rely on their corporate salaries for the bulk of their income. In short, if such workers are anxious, they’re right to be. So they’re not buying mansions or rushing to close — they’re wondering if the floor beneath them is as solid as it felt a year or two ago. It’s a quiet kind of panic: the pullback of those who still have money, but no longer feel safe. The result is weakening demand in what should be the most interest-rate-immune and resilient segment of the market. There’s other evidence to suggest that the wealthy are parking capital, not deploying it. Numerous news reports, ahead of Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) earnings expected Wednesday, are pointing out that some $7 trillion is sitting in money-market funds. While not all this cash reflects U.S. upper-middle-class wealth, a portion of it certainly does, suggesting affluent Americans may currently see more risk than reward in assets such as stocks and housing. At the other end of the market, would-be buyers are priced out by 7% mortgage rates and $400,000 median homes, an affordability crisis devouring some 43% of median household income. When the housing market locks up at both ends, cost alone can’t explain the crisis. You have to look to confidence, and how that has gone missing.

Title: Google slashes quantum requirement to crack Bitcoin by 95% with technology a decade away

Expert predictions point to a possible Bitcoin split due to rising quantum computing capabilities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s cryptographic resilience is facing renewed questions after a Google researcher suggested that quantum computers may be capable of breaking its encryption far sooner than expected. Craig Gidney, a leading quantum computing researcher at Google, published new findings indicating that the hardware requirements to break 2048-bit RSA encryption, a key mathematical element similar to that of Bitcoin, have dropped significantly. Gidney pointed out that his earlier estimates placed the threshold at 20 million noisy qubits, but the new projection requires fewer than one million. The reduced computational burden marks a significant leap in quantum capability, though it might take several days instead of a few hours. The Google researcher attributes the advancement to more refined quantum algorithms and enhanced error correction techniques that reduce the number of physical qubits needed by encoding logical qubits more efficiently. The revelations arrive as concerns grow over the pace of quantum computing development. Last year, Google introduced its Willow chip, a next-generation quantum processor that many believe brought real-world threats to digital security closer than previously assumed. In response, major financial institutions are updating their disclosures. For example, BlackRock recently flagged quantum computing as a material risk for its Bitcoin ETF product, IBIT. According to the firm: “If quantum computing technology is able to advance and significantly increase its capacity relative to the capacity of today’s leading quantum computers, it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like Bitcoin.” This shift reflects growing awareness that technological breakthroughs could challenge Bitcoin’s foundational encryption earlier than anticipated. Despite the concern, some experts believe the crypto sector still has time to adapt to the potential risks. Today’s logical-qubit demos top out at dozens (e.g., Quantinuum’s 12 logical qubits). Gidney’s 1,000,000-qubit figure is about physical (noisy) qubits, not logical. We’re three orders of magnitude away in sheer qubit count, and need major error-rate breakthroughs. Even the physical-qubit goal is likely 8–12 years out, and a true million-logical-qubit machine is decades away. Meanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Fred Krueger believes the emergence of a “quantum-resistant” version of the top crypto is inevitable. He anticipates a network split between a newly fortified Bitcoin and a legacy version, similar to how Ethereum split into ETH and Ethereum Classic. He stated: “Ulimately there will be a fork. ‘Quantum Resistant Bitcoin (QRB)’ and ‘Bitcoin Classic.’ The big money will recognize and push QRB. Some will fight it. Bitcoin Classic (BTC) will become the new Ethereum Classic.” Still, if Bitcoin becomes vulnerable in eight years, the network will not have long to adopt a quantum-resistant upgrade. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Reuters (TRI+0.10%), citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that the company is preparing to release a stripped-down version of its popular Blackwell AI chips that have been specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules. The news comes days before Nvidia prepares to release its first-quarter 2025 earnings. The Blackwell-based, China-only chip will reportedly cost from $6,000 to $8,000 and use conventional GDDR7 memory, a step down from the high-bandwidth tech in Nvidia’s flagship models. The previous H20 chips offered in the country sold for between $10,000 and $12,000. This coming chip also would ditch packaging in technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+0.63%) An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the company is looking at its “limited” options: “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market.” This isn’t Nvidia’s first regulatory rodeo. After the U.S. blocked chip exports to China in 2022, the company responded with watered-down versions. When those got swept up in restrictions in late 2023, Nvidia developed chips with further reduced performance to comply with regulations. And that regulatory merry-go-round has continued. In April, Nvidia took a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China. Now, Nvidia is hoping that this China-specific chip variant will thread the needle. CEO Jensen Huang has been increasingly vocal about his frustrations with U.S. policy. At an event earlier this month, he called the export controls “a failure,” saying they’ve only accelerated China’s push to develop domestic AI hardware — sidelining U.S. players in the process. Tech has become the next battleground in the trade war between the U.S. and China. As a result of Nvidia’s export restrictions, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is gaining ground with its AI chips, which are quickly becoming the preferred alternative for Chinese tech firms. Nvidia’s market share in China has reportedly fallen from 90% to around 50% since 2022. But China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. And this new chip is expected to help the company keep pace overseas despite its market share loss — because as good as Huawei is becoming, Nvidia is still considered better.

Title: Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the future of search, AI agents, and selling Chrome

The head of Google discusses the next AI platform shift and how it could change how we use the internet forever. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. We recorded this conversation in person after the Google I/O developer conference last week in what’s becoming a bit of a Decoder tradition. This is the third year that we’ve done Decoder after I/O, and this one felt really different. Google is in a very confident place right now, and you can really feel that in this conversation. If you caught any of the news from I/O, you know that it was all about AI — particularly a huge new set of AI products, not just models and capabilities. Sundar told me that these products represent a new phase of the AI platform shift, and we talked about that at length: how that shift is playing out, what the markers of these phases are, and whether any of these products can actually deliver a return on the huge investments Google has made in AI over the years. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! This year’s I/O also marked the beginning of what appears to be a new era for search and the web. Google’s new vision for search goes well beyond links to webpages to something that feels a lot more like custom app development. When you search for something, Google’s new AI Mode will build you a custom search results page, including interactive charts and potentially other kinds of apps, in real time. You can see that vision in the new AI Mode, which is now available to all US users. Google’s plan is to “graduate” features from AI Mode into the main search experience over time. I wanted to know how Sundar was thinking about that graduation process and how he thinks that will affect the web itself, which is shaped more than anything by the incentives of Google Search and SEO. You’ll hear Sundar say in several different ways that the web is still getting bigger and Google is sending more traffic to more websites than ever before, but the specifics of that are hotly contested. Just before we talked, the News Media Alliance — the trade group that represents publishers like Conde Nast, The New York Times, and The Verge’s parent company Vox Media — issued what can only be described as a furious statement, calling AI Mode “theft.” So we talked about that, too, and about what happens to the web when AI tools and eventually agents do most of the browsing for us. What does it mean for the web to go from a series of websites when AI tools just see it as a series of databases instead of as sites for people to use? Why would companies like Uber, DoorDash, or Airbnb allow their businesses to get commoditized in that way? If you’ve been listening to the show, you know I’ve been talking about this idea a lot, so Sundar and I spent some time on this idea; it was a real Decoder conversation. Of course, we also talked about the smart glasses that Google announced at I/O and when the next era of AI hardware might arrive — including what Sundar thinks of the big OpenAI and Jony Ive deal that was announced just before we spoke. And I couldn’t let this go without asking about the major antitrust trials that Google is involved in, including the government’s demand that Google sell Chrome, and what the negotiations with the Justice Department have involved. President Donald Trump has long complained about his search results being too negative, but Sundar told me that he will not change search rankings in response to political pressure, calling search “sacrosanct.” There’s a lot in this one — I’m eager to hear what you all think of it. Okay: Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sundar Pichai, you’re the CEO of Alphabet and Google. Welcome back to Decoder. Nilay, good to be back. Feels like a nice tradition post-I/O to be talking to you. So good to be back. I think this is the third year we’ve done this after I/O. I’m excited. Thank you for keeping the tradition alive. Lots to talk about. You announced a lot of things yesterday during the keynote. There’s AI mode rolling out for US users, and big updates to Gemini. There’s Veo 3 and Imagen, the generators that you solved Pokémon with, which is very exciting. My takeaway from yesterday was that Google feels very confident now. There’s a real confidence about the technology coming to life and the products. A lot of things are shipping imminently. What’s the one piece that gave you that confidence? Is it just the volume of things that are shipping? Is it one technology that clicked into being ready for consumers? Where is it coming from? I think it comes from the depth and breadth of the AI frontier we are pushing in a more fundamental and foundational way. We spoke a lot about this theme called research becomes reality, but it is… We’ve always felt we are a deep computer science company, and we’ve been AI-first for a while. So putting all that together and bringing it to our products at the depth and breadth is what I think is really pleasing to see. For example, people may not have noticed it much. It was so quick. We spoke about text diffusion models in the middle of the whole thing, but we are pushing the frontier on all dimensions, right? And Demis [Hassabis] spoke about world models. So I think that’s the exciting part, like how deep we are pushing this frontier and then bringing it to users, and maybe that’s what makes it feel that way. You mentioned research into reality several times. Obviously, a lot of these projects have been cooking in the labs for a long time. You’ve said many times over the past many, many years that you and I have talked about it that you think AI will be as profound as electricity. But you said something yesterday that I think adds to that, which is that we are in a new phase of the platform shift. People have talked about AI being a platform shift for quite a while, but that always has meant to me that there’s a user interface platform shift coming, right? We’re going to interact with computers in natural language in more natural ways, they’ll interact with us back in that same way, and everything will change. Is that the platform shift? Yeah, you are right. Each of these platform shifts changes many things on the I/O front. Nothing to do with Google I/O, just I/O in the traditional computer science sense. You could feel it. Yesterday, when I watched the Android XR… I’ve used them and played around with them, but watching it, with two people talking in different languages, you can envision the future one day where it’ll actually be seamless. In a way, you couldn’t have done it with phones, you couldn’t have done it without AI because there’s nothing in your way. You’re looking at the other person and talking, right? And that is an element of platform shift, but there are many more elements. This is the only platform where I think the actual platform is, over time, capable of creating, self-improving, and so on. In a way, we could have never talked about any other platform before, so that’s why I think it’s much more profound than the other platform shifts. It’ll allow people to create new things because, at each layer of the stack, there’s going to be profound improvements. And so I think that virtuous cycle you get in terms of how you can unleash this creative power to all of society, be it software engineers, be it creators — I think that is going to happen in a much more multiplicative way. So when I say it’s a next phase, I’m talking about that part too. Let me just make that more concrete for people. I think the last platform shift we all understand is the shift to mobile. That’s right. And that was, we’re going to have multi-touch, we’re going to have faster cell connections, we’re going to increase processing power that can go with you everywhere. And then there was a layer of applications that was enabled by all of those things. You can push a button, and a Toyota Camry will show up wherever you are in the world. It’s like a very powerful thing that requires all of those ideas. How would you describe the phase we’re in now compared to that? The phase of this, that first phase of AI was that the transformers work and the models work, and we can all see this capability. The second phase, what is it to you? Just imagine when the internet came, blogging became a thing. Pre-internet, very few people had a means by which they could put their thoughts out to the world. With the internet came a new medium, which allowed people to create and express themselves in a new way. With mobile came cameras, and you could shoot and you could create videos. Look at what’s happened with YouTube. For me, a similar part of this is that we are all talking about things like vibe coding. Yesterday, you saw Veo 3, so we are now in that phase. I think people are going to be able to create AI applications, you can call it, vibe coding, there are many names for it. But that power is yet to be unleashed. We are barely scratching the surface, and these models aren’t quite there. You can kind of do one-shot coding, but you really need to be a programmer to iterate and create something with polish, right? But that frontier is evolving pretty rapidly. So I think you’re going to see a new wave of things, just like mobile did. Just like the internet did. I came to Google at the time when AJAX was the revolution, the fact that the web became dynamic. You had things like Google Maps, Flickr, and Gmail, that all suddenly came into existence. But I think AI is going to turbocharge in a way we haven’t seen before. It feels like what you’re describing is that we’re in the phase where the products are developed, right? The capabilities were the first phase, and now we’re going to make some actual products. And more people can build products than ever before. That’s the multiplicative part I’m talking about. Not just this platform that helps you create more products. The process of creating, developing, etc., is going to be accessible to a much wider swath of humanity than ever before. I’m wondering, when you look at the landscape of products that exist now, most people experience AI in Gemini or ChatGPT as a chatbot. It’s a general-purpose interface to a bunch of knowledge that will talk to you. What products do you see that will have the same kind of impact as the Web 2.0 products you were talking about, besides the general-purpose chatbot? Well, obviously, you’ve seen a wave with coding IDEs, like that entire landscape is… I can’t even keep track of how many new companies have come into it, and people are using a lot of it. And yesterday we showed a bunch of partners with whom we are working. So that’s an area where AI is making the most progress. You’re seeing the application layer, at least in terms of code editors, really come into vogue. We’ve had success with NotebookLM. We launched Flow yesterday. Flow is a new [AI video] product that allows you to create and imagine. So those are all the applications we are doing. I think others are beginning to do it. People are working on legal assistance, and there are all kinds of startups. I was recently in a doctor’s office, and they have an AI that transcribes the whole thing, puts it all in reports, and so on. That’s an enterprise application layer. It kind of works completely differently from when I went on a visit two years ago. So all that change is happening across the board, but I think we are just in the early stages. You will see it play out over the next three to five years in a big way. Did you ask your doctor what model their transcription software is running on? [Laughs] No, I didn’t. No, I didn’t. One of the reasons I’m asking this, and I’m pushing on this, is that the huge investment in the capability from Google and others has to pay off in some products that return on that investment. NotebookLM is great. I don’t think it’s going to fully return on Google’s data center investment, let alone the investment in pure AI research. Do you see a product that can return on that investment at scale? Do you think in 2004 if you had looked at Gmail, which was a 20% project, which people were internally using as an email service, how would we be able to think about Gmail as what led us to do workspace, or get into the enterprise? I made a big bet on Google Cloud, which is tens of billions of dollars in revenue today. And so my point is that things build out over time. Think about the journey we have been on with Waymo. I think one of the mistakes people often make in a period of rapid innovation is thinking about the next big business versus looking at the underlying innovation and saying, “Can you build something and put out something which people love and use?” And out of which you do the next thing, and create value out of it. So when I look at it, AI is such a horizontal piece of technology across our entire business. It’s why it impacts not just Google search, but YouTube, Cloud, and all of Android. You saw XR, etc., Google Play, things like Waymo, and Isomorphic Labs, which is based on AlphaFold. So I’ve never seen one piece of technology that can impact and help us create so many businesses. AI is going to be so useful as an assistant. I think that people will be willing to pay for it, too. We are introducing subscription plans, and so there’s a lot of headroom ahead, I think. And obviously, that’s why we are investing, because we see that opportunity. Some of it will take time, and it may not always be immediately obvious. I gave the Waymo example. The sentiment on Waymo was quite negative three years ago. But actually, as a company, we increased our investment in Waymo at that time, right? Because you’re betting on the underlying technology and you’re seeing the progress of where it’s going. But these are good questions. In some ways, if you don’t realize the opportunities, that may constrain the pace of investment in this area, but I’m optimistic we’ll be able to unlock new opportunities. One reason I wanted to start here as the foundation of the conversation is that you showed off Android XR yesterday. You showed off some prototype glasses, and you have some partners making glasses. A lot of people think augmented reality glasses powered by AI will be the realization of the full platform shift, right? You will have an always-on assistant that can look at the world around you. You showed some of those demos yesterday. The form factor will change, and the interface will change. This will be marketed as big as smartphones were. How close do you think we are to that as a mainstream product? It was a nice reflective moment all the way back from Google Glass. Wearing the product, I think there’s a difference between goggles and glasses. Everyone at The Verge understands as well, but obviously, we are also shipping goggles. We have announced products with Samsung to come later this year. On the XR side, I’m excited about our partnership with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker. We’ll have products in the hands of developers this year, but I think those products will be pretty close to what people eventually see as final products. I’m excited. I think the pace is actually pretty palpable. I’d be shocked if you and I were sitting next year and I wasn’t wearing one of those when I’m doing this. Do you think that will be a mainstream iPhone-level replacement product? Because there’s a lot of hardware that needs to be developed along the way to pull that off. You’re wearing something on your face. I have a prescription. The bar is higher in terms of making the experience seamless enough that you’re willing to wear it on your face and enjoy it for all. I don’t necessarily think next year it will be as mainstream as what you’re talking about, but would millions of people be trying it? I think so, yeah. Both are true. I have to ask you… Just before we sat down, OpenAI announced that Jony Ive was selling a company he had started called “io,” and Ive and his design consultants in Lovefrom would take overall design. They didn’t announce a product, but they said it’s the future of computing and it’s coming next year. Do you anticipate more of that competition, that your competitors who don’t have a smartphone operating system will go even harder in this direction? I’m looking forward to an OpenAI announcement ahead of Google I/O, the night before. First of all, look, stepping back, I mean Jony Ive is one of a kind. You look at his track record over the years, I’ve met him only once or twice, but I’ve admired his work, obviously like so many of us. I think it’s exciting. This is why I feel like there’s so much innovation ahead, and I think people tend to underestimate this moment. In some ways, I always like to point out that when the internet happened, Google didn’t even exist. I think AI is going to be bigger than the internet. There are going to be companies, products, and categories created that we aren’t aware of today. I think the future looks exciting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity to innovate around hardware form factors at this moment with this platform shift. I’m looking forward to seeing what they do. We are going to be doing a lot as well. I think it’s an exciting time to be a consumer, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. I’m looking forward to it. Ive, in that video, described the phone and the laptop as legacy platforms, which is very interesting considering his own history. Are you all the way there that the phone and the laptop are legacy platforms? I think these things, if anything, I’ve found through this AI moment that I’m using the web a lot more, because it’s easier to create a Veo 3 video in my browser on a big screen, right? And so I think the way I’ve internalized this, computing will be available, and you don’t have to make these hard choices. Computing will become so essential to you. You’re going to have it in multiple ways around you when you need it, right? I use a phone, a tablet, a laptop, and I have my workstation. And so I have the breadth of it, but over time… It makes sense to me that at some point in the future, consuming content by pulling out this black glass display rectangle in front of you and looking at it is not the most intuitive way to do it, but I think it’s going to take some time. I feel like we could do a full hour just on Android tablets and where they could go. We’re going to come back for that. A big part of what you’re describing implicates search in really big ways, right? We’re going to be surrounded by information search, Gemini, or some future Google product. We’ll organize that information, take action for you across the web in some way, and you will have a companion. Maybe you only pull out your tablet to watch a video or something. A lot of what’s going on with search has downstream effects on the web, and downstream effects on information providers broadly. Last year, we spent a lot of time talking about those effects. Are you seeing that play out the way that you thought it would? It depends. I think people are consuming a lot more information, and the web is one specific format. We should talk about the web, but zooming back out, there are new platforms like YouTube and others. I think people are just consuming a lot more information, right? It feels like an expansionary moment. I think there are more creators, and people are putting out more content. And so people are generally doing a lot more. Maybe people have a little extra time on their hands, and so it’s a combination of all that. On the web, look, things that have been interesting and… We’ve had these conversations for a while. Obviously, in 2015, there was this famous meme, “The web is dead.” I always have it somewhere around, and I look at it once in a while. Predictions… It has existed for a while. I think the web is evolving pretty profoundly. I think that is true. When we crawl and look at the number of web pages available to us, that number has gone up by 45% in the last two years alone, right? That’s a staggering thing to think of. Can you detect if that volume increase is because more pages are generated by AI or not? This is the thing I may be worried about the most, right? It’s a good question. We generally have many techniques in search to try and understand the quality of a page, including whether it was machine-generated, etc. That doesn’t explain the trend we are seeing. Generally, there are more web pages, right? At an underlying level, I think that’s an interesting phenomenon. I think everybody as a creator like you are at The Verge, has to do everything in a cross-platform, cross-format way. I look at the quality of video content you put out, it’s very sophisticated and very different from how The Verge used to be, maybe five to 10 years ago, right? It has profoundly changed. I think things are becoming more dynamic, and cross-format. I think another thing people are underestimating with AI is that AI will make it zero friction to move from one format to another, right? Because our models are natively multimodal. We tease people’s imagination with audio overviews in NotebookLM, right? The fact that you can throw a bunch of documents at it, you have a podcast, and you can join and learn from it. I think this notion, the static moment of producing content by format, whereas… I think machines can help translate it. It’s almost like different languages and they can go seamlessly between. I think it’s one of the incredible opportunities to be unlocked right ahead. But maybe, I didn’t want to drift from the question we were having. Look, I think people are producing a lot of content, and I see consumers consuming a lot of content. And we see it in our products; others are seeing it too. That’s how I would probably answer at the highest level. The way I see it currently is that the web is at an all-time high as an application platform, right? The fact that Figma exists and is as successful as it is, and its primary interface as a web app is, I think, remarkable. A lot of the products you are talking about are expressed as web apps. Even some of the most interesting search results you showed yesterday are how Google would generate a custom web app for you and display it in a search result to do some data visualization. I think that’s all looking incredible. I think the web as a transaction platform is reaching new highs, especially with rulings that mean smartphone makers have to let people push transactions to the web. There’s something very interesting happening there. As a media platform, it feels like it’s at an all-time low, right? Do you mean the web as a media platform? The web as a media platform, as an information platform. If I were starting The Verge today with 11 of my co-founders and friends, we would start a TikTok channel, and we might start a YouTube channel. We would definitely not start a website with the dependencies we have as a website today. And that’s the dynamic that it feels like AI is pushing on even harder. I’m not fully sure I agree, right? I think if you were to go and restart The Verge again, I bet you would have an extraordinary web presence. At best, no, I’ve thought about this a lot. I think at best our web presence would look like a Substack or a Ghost or something, right? Maybe. I’m not fully sold on that, but you know the space. I acknowledge that you know that space better than I do. I don’t have that intuition, which you do here. But look, in fact, you say the web application platform is at an all-time high, but I’ve looked. I was vibe coding with Replit a few weeks ago. The power of what you’re going to be able to create on the web — we haven’t given that power to developers in 25 years. That is going to come ahead. It’s not exactly clear to me. Maybe today you’re looking at it and say, I wouldn’t put all the investment in because it looks like a lot of investment to do that. But that may not be true two years out, right? If you feel like you would create a TikTok channel, then maybe with 2% extra effort you could have a robust web presence. Why wouldn’t you, right? And so I’m not fully sold on it, but I think it’s a good question to ask. But you have to somehow reconcile that with the fact that overall, web traffic seems to be growing. We see more web pages. Somewhere, we have to explain all of that, too. The publishers, as they often do, responded to Google I/O announcements. So, the News Media Alliance, after AI mode was announced yesterday, I would say they’re very upset. Here’s a statement from the President of the News Media Alliance, “Links for the last redeeming quality of search that gave publishers traffic and revenue. Now, Google takes content by force and uses it with no return, no economic return. That’s the definition of theft.” And they go on to say the DOJ and lawsuits must address it. That’s pretty furious. That’s not a negotiation, right? That’s a “We just want this to stop.” How do you respond to that very loud set of people who say, “Yeah, okay, maybe it’s growing somewhere, but for us, it’s crushing our businesses.” First of all, through all the products, AI mode is going to have sources. And we are very committed as a direction, as a product direction to make... I think part of why people come to Google is to experience that breadth of the web and go in the direction they want to, right? So I view us as giving more context. Yes, there are certain questions that may get answers, but overall… And that’s the pattern we see today, right? And, if anything over the last year, it’s clear to us that the breadth of area we are sending people to is increasing. And so I expect that to be true with AI mode as well. But if it was increasing, wouldn’t they be less angry with you? You’re always going to have areas where people are robustly debating value exchanges, etc., like app developers and platforms. That’s not on the web, etc. There’s always going to be — when you’re running a platform — these debates. I would challenge, I think more than any other company, we prioritize sending traffic to the web. No one sends traffic to the web in the way we do. I look at other companies, newer emerging companies, where they openly talk about it as something they’re not going to do. We are the only ones who make it a high priority, agonize, and so on. We’ll engage, and we’ve always engaged. There are going to be debates through it all, but we are committed to, I’ve said this before, everything we do across all... You will see us five years from now sending a lot of traffic out to the web. I think that’s the product direction we are committed to. I think it’s what users look for when they come to Google, and the nature of it will evolve. But I am confident that that’s the direction we’ll continue taking. Is there public data that shows that AI overviews and AI mode actually send more traffic out than the previous search engine results page? The way we look at it is... I mean, obviously, we take a lot of... We are definitely sending traffic to a wider range of sources and publishers. And because just like we’ve done over 25 years, we’ve been through the same with featured snippets, the quality of... It’s higher-quality referral traffic, too. And we can observe it because the time that people spend is one metric. And there are other ways by which we measure the quality of our outbound traffic, and it’s also increasing. And overall, through this transition, I think AI is also growing, and the growth compounds over time. So whenever we have worked through these transitions, it ends up posted. That’s how Google has worked for 25 years, and we end up sending more traffic over time. So that’s how I would expect all this to play out. So why do you think that there is so much general economic turmoil on that side of the house? If you’re sending more traffic and the goal over time is to make sure that that works… We’re a year into it, and it doesn’t seem to have gotten better over there. No, look, we are sending traffic to a broader source of people. People may be surfacing more content, looking at more content, so someone may individually see less. There are all kinds of... At the end of the day, we are reflecting what users want. If you do the wrong thing, users won’t use our product and go somewhere else. And so you have all these dynamics underway, and I think we have genuinely… We took a long time designing AI overviews, and we are constantly iterating in a way that we prioritize this, sources, and sending traffic to the web. I mean, my criticism of this industry, just to be clear, is that everyone’s addicted to Google, and it would be better if they weren’t. But they’re addicted to Google, right? And they’re feeling it. And then on top of that, you see… You’ve mentioned several times that overall queries are increasing on Google surfaces, but they’re changing. They’re getting longer, they’re getting more complicated. AI mode might walk you through several steps. Maybe some people are searching on TikTok now. Eddie Cue on the stand in the trial the other day said that search in Safari for the last month dropped for the first time in 22 years. That’s a big stat. Obviously, your stock price was affected by it. There was a statement. Is that trend bearing out that the standard Google search is dropping from devices, and different kinds of searches are increasing? No. We’ve been very clear. We’re seeing overall query growth in search. But have you actually seen the drop in Safari? We have a comprehensive view of how we look at data across the board. There can be a lot of noise in search data, but everything we see tells us that we are seeing query growth, including across Apple’s devices and platforms. Specifically, I think we quantified the query growth from AI overviews. And what’s healthy is that the query growth is continuing to grow over time. So to step back, and this is what I’ve said before, it feels very far from a zero-sum game to me. I said this last year. I think people are... It’s interesting we spoke about TikTok, right? Think about how profound of a new product TikTok was. How has YouTube done since TikTok has come, right? You could ask all these questions there. Why is it that TikTok arrives and YouTube has grown? And so I think what we always underestimate in these moments is that people are engaging more, doing more with it. We are improving our products. And so that’s how I would think about these moments. Let me just broaden that out to agents. I watched Demis Hassabis yesterday. He was on stage with Sergey Brin and Alex Kantrowitz asked him, “What does the web look like in 10 years?” And Demis said, “I don’t know that an agent-first web looks anything like the web that we have today. I don’t know that we have to render web pages for agents the way that we have to see them.” That kind of implies that the web will turn into a series of databases for various agents to go and ask questions to, and then return those answers. And I’ve been thinking about this in the context of services like Uber, DoorDash, and Airbnb. Why would they want to participate in that and be abstracted away for agents to use the services they’ve spent a lot of time and money building? Two things, though. First, there’s a lot to unpack, a fascinating topic. The web is a series of databases, etc. We build a UI on top of it for all of us to conceive. This is exactly what I wanted, “the web is a series of databases.” It is. But I think I listened to the Demis and Sergey conversation yesterday. I enjoyed it. I think he’s saying for an agent-first web, for a web that is interacting with agents, you would think about how to make that process more efficient. Today, you’re running a restaurant, people are coming, dining and eating, and people are ordering takeout and delivery. Obviously, for you to service the takeout, you would think about it differently than all the tables, the clothing, and the furniture. But both are important to you. You could be a restaurant that decides not to participate in the takeout business. I’m only going to focus on the dining experience. You’re going to have some people that are vice versa. I’m going to say, I’m going to go all in on this and run a different experience. So, to your question on agents… I think of agents as a new powerful format. I do think it’ll happen in enterprises faster than in consumer. In the context of an enterprise, you have a CIO who’s able to go and say, “I really don’t know why these two things don’t talk to each other. I am not going to buy more of this unless you interoperate with this.” I think it’s part of why you see, on the enterprise side, a lot more agentic experiences. On the consumer side, I think what you’re saying is a good point. People have to think about and say, “What is the value for me to participate in this world?” And it could come in many ways. It could be because I participated in it, and overall, my business grows. Some people may feel that it’s disintermediating, and doesn’t make sense. I think all of that can happen, but users may work with their feet. You may find some people are supporting the agent experience, and your life is better because of it. And so you’re going to have all these dynamics, and I think they’re going to try and find an equilibrium somewhere. That’s how everything evolves. I mean, I think the idea that the web is a series of databases and we change the interface… First of all, this is the most Decoder conversation that we’ve ever had. I’m very happy with it. But I had Dara [Khosrowshahi] from Uber on the show. I asked him this question from his perspective, and his answer attracts yours broadly. He said, first, we’ll do it because it’s cool and we’ll see if there’s value there. And if there is, he’s going to charge a big fee for the agent to come and use Uber. Because losing the customer for him, or losing the ability to upsell or sell a subscription, none of that is great. The same is true for Airbnb. I keep calling it the DoorDash problem. DoorDash should not be a dumb pipe for sandwiches. They’re actually trying to run a business, and they want the customer relationship. And so if the agents are going across the web and they’re looking at all these databases and saying, okay, this is where I get food from, and this is where I get cars from, and this is where I book… I think the demo was booking a vacation home in Spanish, and I’m going to connect you to that travel agent. Is it just going to be tolls that everyone pays to let the agents work? The CIO gets to just spend money to solve the problem. He says, “I want this capability from you. I’m just going to pay you to do it.” The market, the consumer market, doesn’t have that capability, right? Well, look, all kinds of models may emerge, right? I can literally envision 20 different ways this could work. Consumers could pay a subscription for agents, and the agents could revenue share back. So that is the CIO-like use case you are talking about, that’s possible. We can’t rule that out. I don’t think we should underestimate... People may actually see more value in participating in it. I think this is... It’s tough to predict, but I do think that over time, if you’re removing friction and improving user experience, it’s tough to bet against those in the long run. And so I think if you are lowering friction for it and then people are enjoying using it, somebody’s going to want to participate in it and grow their business. And would brands want to be in retailers? Why don’t they sell directly today? Why won’t they do that? Because retailers provide value in the middle. And why do merchants take credit cards? Why... I’m just saying. So there are many parts, and you find equilibrium because merchants take credit cards so they see more business as part of taking credit cards than not, which justifies the increased cost of taking credit cards. It may not be the perfect analogy, but I think there are all these kinds of effects going around, and so... But what you’re saying is true. Some of this will slow progress in agents just because we all are excited about Agent2Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP)... And we think no, some of it will slow progress, but I think it’ll be very dynamic. Yeah. Yeah. There are other pressures on Google. There are antitrust pressures. The government would like you to sell Chrome. Can you do all the things you want to do if you’re made to sell Chrome? I don’t want to comment on... We are in a legal process. I look at having been directly involved in building Chrome. I look at... I think there are very few companies that would’ve... We not only improved our product, but we also improved the state of the web by building Chrome. We open-sourced it. We provided Chromium. Everyone else has access to the browser. So I think the amount of R&D, the amount of innovation we put into it, the investments in security, etc., we do, so I think we- But if you’re made to sell it, can you do all the things that you want to do? I don’t think that’s the scenario we’re looking at, but stepping back… Look, I think as a company, we think of ourselves as a deeply foundational technology company, which then translates into products that touch billions of people. So we do it across many, many things. And so, of course, I think, look, as a company, we’re going to continue investing and doing our best to innovate and build a successful business in all scenarios. So this is how I would answer it. The Trump administration is extremely transactional, I would say. The tech industry has a new relationship with Trump in his second term. You were at the inauguration. Have you had conversations about what a settlement might look like and what the Trump administration might demand to make these problems go away? We’ve engaged with the DOJ, like we did over the years, in the context of all the cases we have. So that’s how we normally do these conversations. Trump has very publicly said he doesn’t like his search ranking, and he wants it changed in some way. Would you ever adjust the search ranking for Donald Trump? No. Look, we have a... I can’t... Today, the way Google Search works is that I cannot... No person at Google can influence the ranking algorithm. AI mode is different, right? We’ve seen system prompts adjusted in very chaotic ways from some of your competitors. Is that something that you would be open to in a world where you’re serving the full answer? Would you adjust the AI mode responses in response to political pressure? No. Because we’ve certainly seen in Grok and others, the system prompts change the answers in dramatic ways. The way we do ranking is sacrosanct to us. We’ve done it for over 25 years. We make a lot of... There are a lot of ranking signals we take into account and stuff. And if there’s broad feedback from people that something isn’t working, we will look at it systematically and try and make changes, but we don’t look at individual cases and change the rankings. When you think about those sources of information, one of the things that I have been thinking about a lot is, I don’t know, how the CDC web pages have changed a lot recently. Diversity, equity, and inclusion language has been removed from pages across the government. Those used to be very high-ranking sources in Google Search. We just implicitly trusted the CDC’s web pages in some ways. Are you re-evaluating that? How there might be misinformation on some of these pages that then gets synthesized into AI results? Oh, it’s a misunderstanding of how search works. We don’t individually evaluate the authoritativeness of a page right then. It’s what our signals do. Obviously, our signals are multiple orders of magnitude more complicated than PageRank today. But to use PageRank as an example, we weren’t the ones determining how authoritative a page is. It’s how other pages were linking to it, like an academic citation, etc. So we are not making those decisions today. And so I don’t see that changing. As you synthesize more of the answers, do you think you’re going to have to take more responsibility for the results? We are giving context around it, but we’re still anchoring it in the sources we find. But we’ve always felt a high bar at Google. I mean, last year when we launched AI Overviews, I think people were adversarially querying to find errors, and the error rate was one in 7 million for adversarial queries, and so... But that’s the bar we’ve always operated at as a company. And so I think to me, nothing has changed. Google operates at a very high bar. That’s the bar we strive to meet, and our search page results are there for everyone to see. With that comes natural accountability, and we have to constantly earn people’s trust. So that’s how I would approach it. What do you think the marker is for the next phase of the platform shift after this one? We opened by talking about how we’re in a second phase. What’s the marker for the final phase, or the third phase? Of the platform shift, do you mean? Yeah. Of the AI platform? What are you looking for as the next marker? I think the real thing about AI, which I think is why I’ve always called it more profound, is self-improving technology. Having watched AlphaGo start from scratch, not knowing how to play Go, and within a couple of hours or four hours, be better than top-level human players, and in eight hours, no human can ever aspire to play against it. And that’s the essence of the technology, obviously in a deep way. I think there’s so much ahead on the opportunity side. I’m blown away by the ability to discover new drugs, completely change how we treat diseases like cancer over time, etc. The opportunity is there. The creative power, which I talked about, which we’re putting in everyone’s hands, the next generation of kids, everyone can program and will... If you think of something, you can create it. I don’t think we have comprehended what that means, but that’s going to be true. The part where the next phase of the shift is going to be really meaningful is when this translates into the physical world through robotics. So that aha moment of robotics, I think, when it happens, that’s going to be the next big thing we will all grapple with. Today they’re all online and you’re doing things with it, but on one hand… Today, I think of Waymo as a robot. So we are running around driving a robot, but I’m talking about a more general-purpose robot. And when AI creates that magical moment with robotics, I think that’ll be a big platform shift as well. Yeah. I’m looking forward to it. Next year we’re going to do this with glasses and robots. It’s going to be great. [Laughs] We’ll give it a shot. Thank you so much, Sundar. All right. Thanks, Nilay.

This article first appeared on kyndinfo.notion.site. For more more information, updates, and additional resources, please see here. I’ve been wanting to write books that are like introductory science texts but not superficial. Books that go beyond pop science explanations but aren’t dry and dense like academic texts. Take quantum physics as an example. A pop science book might explain that the world is made of tiny particles, even smaller than atoms, and that these particles are also waves. Very intriguing. But after reading it, you realize that you still don’t actually understand how to make sense of wave-particle duality, how it really works, or what it means mathematically. So I turn to a college-level book, thinking, “This will give me the answers.” Instead, I find a wall of formalism. Dense derivations, little motivation, and an assumption that I already know what’s important. These books explain the details, but they don’t help me much, not having a real math or science background. Having said this, I’ve been struggling to write a book or article that’s truly for beginners. Many of my past articles were written for relative beginners, often based on lectures, workshops, or explanatory documents I’ve shared with colleagues and friends. I’ve been trying to keep them more engaging rather than feel like dry textbooks. But at the same time, they are not really for beginners. Many of them assume a certain level of prior knowledge, since it is a massive effort to build up all the knowledge from scratch. There are already great resources out there. For example, I don’t think I should write yet another book on vector math, and I’m not the best person to do that. So after contemplating this, I’ve decided to let go of the idea of perfect thoroughness or consistency, at least for now. Chasing that feels like an overwhelming amount of work without yielding much more of what the world might be missing. Instead, what I find could be more fun and uniquely valuable is externalizing the maps in my mind. The overviews, the relationships between key concepts, and the motivations behind them. As always, these are also an exercise for myself. They are like notes to organize and structure ideas, which might one day evolve into a more structured book. At the same time, I’m trying to create something that helps readers orient themselves better. To provide a sense of where things fit, what’s important, and what gaps they might need to fill in from somewhere else. There are 8 sections in this article covering various perspectives.

In an everyday sense, space feels like a void for objects and matter to fill. We are all in space and move within space. It seems like a backdrop that exists independently of everything inside it. That’s what Newton thought too. He wrote: Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. But Newton also thought that even if absolute space exists, it is practically inconceivable to us. Where in the absolute are we? We’d never know. So he continues: Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies. What he is saying is that we can only measure position relative to something. When we walk, we know we move relative to the ground, or the Earth. The revolution of the Earth is the movement relative to the Sun. Then the Sun or the solar system moves relative to the galaxy. From a relativistic perspective, both geocentrism and heliocentrism can be seen as correct in their own reference frames, but neither is absolutely correct. It’s just that heliocentrism provides a much simpler model for the motion of planets. However, there is a huge gap between those who only believe in geocentrism and those who discovered heliocentrism, or dogmatists and inquirers. “Orb – on the movement of earth” is a great historical fiction on this topic. We want to draw stuff on a computer. To do that, we need to have three things: an origin (a reference point to measure the position relatively from), axes along which we measure distances, and a unit to define what distance corresponds to a number 1. In theory, you can pick them freely, but most software has its own default coordinate system. For 2D drawing, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, P5.js, and openFrameworks, the origin is usually the top-left corner of a canvas, and axes are horizontal (x) and vertical (y). The unit is usually a pixel or the device unit. For example, on a Retina display Mac, 1 point corresponds to 2 or 3 (or other numbers depending on your settings) physical pixels. This factor is set so that the numbers you choose appear about the same size perceptually regardless of the actual resolution of the device. A bit more about “perceptually the same size” : for example, text of size “14” is usually rendered smaller on mobile devices than on a laptop, and much bigger on a TV, because these devices are designed to be seen from different viewing distances. There is no perfect formula for this, but most manufacturers converge in the same range, so you don’t have to worry too much about each device separately. I said “default” because in many cases, you can manipulate the space, or rather the coordinate system. In design tools, you can drag the canvas and zoom in and out. Programming frameworks often provide methods to translate, scale and rotate the space, such as p5.js’s translate(), scale(), rotate() functions, or you can write your own functions to process the coordinates. You can also skew the space. Axes are usually selected to cross at 90° but this isn’t necessary. As long as they are independent, meaning they are not parallel, you can express a position uniquely by selecting one value for each of the axes. The demo below from the Mapping page demonstrates affine transformation, which is a simple method to enable these kinds of coordinate transformations. Once you have a coordinate system, you can move things around in this space. Newtonian physics is the perfect stating point. In Newtonian physics, you start from a position, then apply velocity to move it, and apply acceleration to change the velocity. All of these are expressed by vectors, which is basically just a few numbers (called components) put together. Expressing them as vectors makes it much easier to handle them, as opposed to manipulating the values per axis, and there are several very useful operations defined for vectors that you cannot avoid because they’re too good. Newton and VectorsVector Operations Of course, what comes after 2D is 3D. Moving up one dimension is just simple. You define a position is a vector with 3 components instead of 2. Do the same for the velocity, acceleration, etc. as long as they are defined as vectors, the math stays basically the same. What is different, and can be a lot more challenging, is rendering. Because your canvas is 2D, you cannot just place things defined in a 3D space on it. You need to translate the points in 3D space to 2D space somehow. This is called projection, which dates back to the 15th century during Brunelleschi’s time. Projection and 3D Rendering A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Also, to make things look 3D, lighting or shading (basically the same thing — you add light to the scene, which creates shade too) plays an important role. Without light and shade, a sphere would look like just a circle. Shadows casting from one object onto another will clarify their spatial relationship. Light It is your choice of style though. You can choose to draw your scene flat and cartoonish. You can go up to higher dimensions. No matter how much you go up, vectors will help you keeping the math the same. Thinking about higher dimensions not usually for graphics, but any data that can be represented with multiple numeric parameters are thought as a vector in multi dimensional space, with each parameter corresponding to a single axes. Then you can apply familiar concepts and operations to the data, such as addition, multiplication, calculating distance and angle, etc. In fact, large language models (LLM) represent concepts like “dog,” “human,” “run,” “happy,” etc. as points in a mega-multidimensional space (like, 3072 dimensions), and you can do math between them to, for example, measure conceptual distance or similarity between two words or sentences. Getting familiar with this is critical for understanding how current AI models work. Dimensions Colors can be represented with a series of numbers, such as R, G, and B. So they are vectors, and they live in a space. In fact, people have invented many different spatial models to represent colors “accurately” for different purposes. Imagining the relationship of colors spatially helps grasping them holistically and intuitively. Changing the hue is rotation, brightening is ascending, etc. Each different color model organizes colors differently, offering different mental models. Choosing the right model for your purpose can be critical for making your work easy and look good. Colors and Numbers In a space, you can measure distances between points. The most common way is the Euclidean distance, which is basically the length of the straight line between two points. In math, there are various kinds of spaces and some of them don’t have the concept of distance. But that is not the only distance we care about. How do you measure the distance from Tokyo to São Paulo? What you want is probably not a straight line distance between two points, but a curved length along the surface of the Earth. This is called spherical geometry. How about a checkerboard? How do you measure distances between two squares? Perhaps the number of moves it takes? Various distances The concept of distance becomes important in various cases, for example in finding the shortest path to move characters along in game design, or dividing territories based on the distances. Visualizing Distances In computer graphics, functions that returns the distance from a point to the surface of object, called signed distance functions, or SDF are often used for 3D rendering. Signed distance functions So, what is space, after all? The answer depends. For most of our purposes when sketching something with code, Newtonian or Euclidean spaces provide the most intuitive and familiar way of thinking about space — flat, predictable, and measurable with straightforward distances and angles. But this is neither the only space nor the true shape of space. It’s not the true shape of space because Einstein’s general relativity describes spacetime as a curved, four-dimensional manifold. Meanwhile, quantum physics reveals that at the smallest scales, space and time behave in probabilistic, discontinuous, and often counterintuitive ways. Scientists have shown that our naive, everyday understanding of space and time breaks down at both the micro and macro scales. It’s not the only space because mathematicians have been generalizing and expanding the concept of “space.” Riemannian geometry broadens the idea of geometry to include uniform and non-uniform curved spaces, including Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, and other geometries we touched upon in the distance discussion above. Space isn’t even just about distance or geometry. Topology focuses on how shapes are connected, regardless of size or distance. Mathematics even defines spaces that aren’t intuitively spatial at all, like the space of all polynomials of a certain degree, where the focus is on the coefficients rather than the shape or a curve. If you’re interested, go forward and explore these fascinating concepts. Color is a fascinating topic that lies between science and human perception. Physically, we know how humans perceive colors. We have photoreceptors called cones in our eyes that react to different frequencies of light, and the levels of stimuli to these three types of cones determine what color we see. The coverage of each type of cone roughly matches with the spectrum of red, green, and blue; that’s why RGB displays can show us various colors even though they have only three colors of light-emitting elements. Spectrum and Cones However, this model doesn’t necessary explain what we actually experience. For example, the violet and red at both ends of the spectrum are actually continuous, with purple in between them. We see different brightness depending on the hue even when the amount of physical light is the same (in general, yellow looks much brighter than blue). We even associate different feelings, emotions, and meanings to the colors. People have been creating different models to describe colors. These are roughly divided into two categories: ones that are mainly derived from physical properties, and ones are more based on the ways we normally describe colors. The first challenge in systematizing colors is that different people have different responses to the spectrum of colors. To find a sort of average, called the standard (colorimetric) observer, an experiment called Wright-Guild color matching was conducted. The basic idea is that the participant is presented with a monochromatic color, which is a color with a single frequency of light, and asked to reproduce the same color by mixing three primary colors (red, green, blue) to match with a target color. The tricky part is that the three physical lights can’t reproduce every color. The participants could match a lot of the target colors just by adjusting the brightness of each primary. But for some colors, they couldn’t get it right unless they actually subtracted one of the primary lights. There isn’t such a thing called negative light, so they solved this by adding the “negative” light to the target color side instead of the mixing side. To better understand this, look at the chart above again. Because each cone covers a relatively broad range, there is no light that can stimulate them independently. There are inevitably certain balances of cone stimulations that can’t be achieved using just a combination of three lights. They eventually transformed the data into something called the CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which is basically a remapping of the RGB measurements to get rid of the negative values by picking new “primaries” that were more imaginary concepts than actual lights. CIE Color spaces Most color models today are based on this CIE color space, meaning that the values in a system can be converted to values in XYZ. The RGB color model that we use on computers today completely fits within the XYZ color space (because by definition, XYZ space has all the human-perceivable colors and even more). Some other ways of describing colors are based on the ways we talk about colors. When we see colors, we say which kind of colors they are (reddish, yellowish), how bright or dark they are, how saturated or vivid, or dull or grayish, etc. The Munsell color system is a system to break down colors by three attributes: hue (such as red, blue, and green), value (lightness), and chroma (vividness or purity of the color). The many color models we use on computers are similar to Munsell’s model, but are designed to be able to be mapped to the RGB values on the screen and thus to XYZ values. Various Color Models These models allow us to compute colors. For example, we can add, subtract, multiply, or rotate colors. What operations make sense and the results you get vary from model to model, and it is important to select a model for your purpose. Computing Colors Being able to process colors to get the desired tone is a critical skill in image and video production. Color Processing Mixing colors is its own deep world. There are so many ways to mix colors. If you are familiar with tools like Photoshop, you probably know there are a bunch of “blending modes” such as add, multiply, screen, overlay, etc. These are different ways to calculate a new color based on the input colors. Most of them are defined with RGB color model. Using the other models can yield different results. Mixing colors in the real world is even more complex, because the color mixing in the real world is the result of various materials reflecting, refracting, and absorbing light. There isn’t a single formula to solve this, but the Kubelka-Munk model is known for emulating real paints consisting of a medium and different colored particles inside. Mixing Colors Light striking the retina lets us see colors. To fully understand how colors happen to us, we must understand how light travels from its source to our eyes, bouncing off surfaces while reflecting and refracting along the way. Reflection and Refraction When the light hits an object, the object absorbs some of the light and reflects the others. On transparent objects, some also passes through. Different materials behave differently. If the material absorbs red and yellow spectrums of light more than blue, then the object will look blue. Rough surfaces will scatter the light in all different directions, thus you don’t see clear reflections of other objects on them, while smooth surfaces will mirror the surroundings more clearly. There are many different methods to simulate this process, from very rough to more accurate approaches. Studying these methods can help you understand how we see colors on objects and better control the colors and appearance of your rendering. Illuminating objects The last section is just an example of using these theories in practice. This installation for KAF Digital space mixes several methods discussed above to fill the space with colors that have the more meditative quality of Fangor’s oil painting, appearing less digital and flashy. A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Filling Space with Colors One of the most fun parts of sketching with code is that it’s not static. Let’s draw both in space and time. How do you move a thing? Just push it. Sir Isaac Newton basically said that things stay at rest in the same position, or keep moving at the same velocity until you apply force to accelerate them. Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are the most fundamental concepts to understand physical motion. Emulating these concepts is extremely simple: frame by frame, just add force to acceleration to change it, then acceleration to velocity, then velocity to position. Newtonian mechanics Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are in relationships of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is the rate of change, and integration is the accumulation of changes. For example, velocity is a quantity that describes how much position will change at a certain moment, and position is the result of velocity being applied and accumulated over time. These subjects might have been annoying in math class. But the foundational ideas are quite simple, and luckily in sketching motion with code, you usually don’t have to solve any equations, but instead can use a very rough approximation called numerical integration, which breaks down the changes into simple additions per small amount of time. You probably have been using this method already without knowing it, for example, the Newtonian physics simulations above are based on a numerical approach instead of mathematically accurate methods. DifferentiationIntegration The proper way to solve differentiation and integrations by solving equation is called analytical solution. Then the approximation by dividing the changes over a small amount of time is called numerical approximation. As mentioned above, the latter is the most common and actually more useful in so many cases, but understanding the relationship between these two approaches is important since both have their own merits and drawbacks. The numeric approach is preferred not just because it’s easier, but because it’s also more flexible. Solving motion through equations is like predicting the future. Once solved, you know exactly what will happen at any moment. But it’s often difficult or impossible to account for all variables. Even calculating the movement of three objects drawn by gravity becomes unpredictable. Any system involving external factors, like human interaction, cannot be determined in advance. Since the numeric approach calculates changes bit by bit (very often frame by frame), it is pretty easy to react to unpredictable changes by updating parameters in real time. The prediction of the gravitational motion of three objects, made popular by Cixin Liu’s bestseller The Three-Body Problem, is called the Three-Body Problem. While solving the two-body problem (like the Earth and Moon) is relatively straightforward and has a neat, predictable solution, the three-body problem is usually chaotic and unpredictable. A common drawback with numerical methods is their inaccuracy. Because these methods approximate smooth motion through discrete changes, the results can go slightly off from physically accurate motion. There are several ways to minimize this problem. The most popular approaches are called the Improved Euler method and Runge-Kutta method (the Euler method is actually a special case of Runge-Kutta). Continuous Time and Discrete Time Simulations are, by nature, hard to predict precisely, because that’s the point. They’re meant to create or mimic phenomena that can’t be fully described in advance. We simulate weather, for example, because we don’t know exactly what will happen. But this can be a problem when you want more direct control over how things move, where they end up, and when. Also sometimes, you may even want to break the laws of physics. Great animators and motion designers often exaggerate movement and timing, bending or ignoring realism to create something more expressive or impactful. A very common technique in motion design is called tweening, short for in-betweening. You start from defining a start and end state, then fill the intermediate frames by interpolating between them. The word comes from the days when animators hand-drew the frames that filled the gap between key poses (many still do — some expressions simply can’t be captured any other way). In computer animation, we often use easing functions to control these transitions. Easing functions connect one value to another, changing the pace in between, like slowing in, speeding out, bouncing, etc. In motion design, you can think of an easing function as a kind of mapping between time and another value, such as position, scale, or opacity. Interpolation and Animation Things don’t just move freely in the real world. On Earth, everything is bound by gravity. Our body movement is constrained by the structure of bones and muscles, but this constraint is what lets us move around and lift things using our bones as levers. Adding constraints to objects is a way to add reality to the motion. Verlet Integration is a way to create simple physics simulations by connecting dots with sticks which constrains the distance between two points. Though simple, this technique is very flexible, and by combining multiple points and sticks, you can create various kinds of objects from rigid bodies to soft string-like objects. Building Ragdolls To control movement more precisely and intentionally, you might want to study kinematics. Forward kinematics and inverse kinematics are common techniques used in robotics, games, and so on to describe the motion of jointed parts, such as mechanical arms or human bodies. Both methods handle structures made of multiple segments and joints to connect them. Forward kinematics starts from the root of the connection and propagates the posture going forward to the end. You directly manipulate the rotation of each joint, and that will determine the overall movement. Kinematics Inverse kinematics is more goal-driven. You define where you want the endpoint to be, then the algorithm figures out the rotation of each joint that makes the desired result happen. Kinematics Motion of objects and life in the real world is often unpredictable, and you can always introduce some randomness to your design. The demo below shows four random walkers with different methods to generate random values. In real applications, you might want to combine more predictable methods like above with some randomness. Depending on your goal, play around and find a sweet spot. Taming Randomness While we’ve explored how to move objects and characters, there’s one more crucial but invisible actor to consider: the camera. How you frame the scene and position the viewpoint dramatically shapes the final result. Camera in Action When you sketch with motion, you’re not just placing things in space but you are giving them life in time. Whether you follow the rules of physics, break them for expressiveness, or invent your own systems, motion opens a lot possibilities for exploration and creativity. If you’re curious, keep experimenting and see where the next movement leads. A post shared by kyndinfo (@kyndinfo) Human perception has evolved over a long time to give us useful information about the world. But what we perceive is only a little sliver of what’s actually out there. For example, light, or electromagnetic waves more broadly, spans a vast range of frequencies, but we can only see a small part of that spectrum. The reason we probably settled on this specific range is that it was good enough to detect and distinguish everyday objects, plants, and animals, helping us survive and navigate our environment. Another reason is more physical: many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, like X-rays or gamma rays, tend to pass through objects or scatter unpredictably. That makes it difficult, if not impossible, for animals to evolve organs that can capture them. The way we perceive different physical phenomena doesn’t always match their actual physical nature. Light and sound are both waves, but we almost never experience them as vibrations (except for very low-frequency sounds). In both cases, frequency affects what we perceive, but in very different ways. Sound frequencies are perceived as pitch, and we describe them as “high” or “low.” On the other hand, different frequencies of light appear to us as different hues of colors without any sense of high or low frequency. Studying perception is fascinating because every person’s experience of the world is different. No one else sees exactly the same colors you see. Your perception exists only within you and doesn’t exist without you. For this reason, the study of perception can’t be purely objective. We have to ask people how they feel. In fact, the color models we use today are based on data collected from many people comparing colors and describing how similar or different they appear. Some people may extend this to say the world doesn’t exist without you, or it is impossible to understand someone else. Let’s not go there yet. How we perceive and use color is shaped by many different factors. First, our biology. As we touched upon earlier, we perceive different light frequencies as different hues, not as a one-dimensional gradient from red to violet, but arranged in a circle. This is because we perceive colors based on the balance between three receptors (cones) for different ranges of frequencies, each roughly corresponding to red, green, and blue. The actual light is a mixture of different frequencies. If a light contains more blue and red but less green, we perceive it as purple, a color that doesn’t actually exist in the spectrum itself — below red is infrared, and above violet is ultraviolet. This reminds us that color might be more about what’s happening inside us than something intrinsic to the light itself. Colors are also cultural and social. Despite not knowing exactly what other people are seeing, we tend to generally agree on how we see colors. We can think of this in terms of semantics, such as red or yellow-and-black stripes for danger, to feelings and aesthetics like “blue feels cool” and “green is relaxing,” to what feels pleasing versus jarring. These associations likely started from nature, where certain objects and phenomena have specific frequencies, and then were influenced by cultural aspects, as certain colors are used repeatedly in specific ways to reinforce our associations. For example, unripe fruits are usually green, and they turn yellow, orange, or red when they are ready to eat, and we’ve been reinforcing these associations by using these warm colors on food packages, signboards, etc. Our view on colors has also been significantly influenced and constrained by our tools. People have been working hard to reproduce and create various colors—from using plant-based dyes, to making expensive gemstones into paints, chemical and synthetic compounds, to analog and digital displays, and even nanotechnologies to create structural colors (such as iridescence). As colors became more available, they got more involved in our culture and even economies, creating trend cycles of colors to drive consumption. The fact that people don’t see colors in the same way cannot be emphasized enough. It is estimated that there are approximately 300 million people in the world with color vision deficiency. I’d even hesitate to call it a ‘deficiency’—it’s really just a different way of seeing. We often use charts like the one below to simulate different perceptions (the demo is emulating deuteranopia). This probably does a good job of illustrating where people may have difficulty distinguishing colors, but this is not representing the world they’re seeing. It’s not true to say the world appears mostly yellow and blue to people with deuteranopia. Representing someone’s vision for someone else is impossible, but at least understanding how we see colors and how to manipulate them systematically can help us imagine and approach this challenging and fascinating problem. Computing Colors All of this shows that color perception is a complex mix of physical phenomena, evolutionary quirks, instinct, culture, and tools from pigments to pixels. And all of it is, in a way, somewhat arbitrary. It’s just the way the world and we humans happened to turn out. Depending on the angle you look from, you can describe color in many different ways. That’s why we have so many color systems and models. We are only scratching the surface of this topic in Colors and Numbers, but there are tons more that we can discuss. I recommend the following book for the history of color theories and their use. The History of Colour: A Universe of Chromatic Phenomena This comprehensive, beautiful book delves deep into the complex but fascinating story of our relationship with colour throughout human history. Amazon Sound is also a wave. Unlike color, we can actually feel its frequency more directly, though we don’t always notice it as physical vibration. Lower frequencies feel “low,” and higher frequencies feel “high.” This height of sound is called pitch. Interestingly, we don’t experience pitch as just a straight line—it feels more like a spiral. For example, if you start at 440 Hz (the A note) and go up, you’ll eventually hit another A at 880 Hz at exactly double the frequency. It’s not the same sound, but we hear it as the same note, just in a higher octave. Western music typically divides the octave is into 12 pitches, each spaced evenly in terms of frequency ratio. Other musical cultures divide the octave differently. Some use more notes, some fewer, but the concept of the octave itself shows up pretty much everywhere. Pitch and Frequency Not just pitch, we can also tell sounds apart based on their timbre, which is like the texture or color of a sound. That’s how you can tell apart different sounds, like a bird chirping, car horns, or instruments like piano and trumpet. In Japanese, timbre is called 音色 (on-shoku), which literally means “sound color.” Both pitch and timbre are tied to the physical characteristics of the thing that’s making the sound. Let’s take a guitar string as an example. The pitch depends on its length and weight. The longer or heavier the string, the lower the pitch. But the sound a string makes isn’t just one pure frequency. When you pluck it, the string vibrates in many ways at once. The main pitch is called the fundamental frequency, but parts of the string also vibrate in smaller sections—halves, thirds, quarters, etc. These create harmonics or overtones, which are simple multiples of the base frequency. This happens with any object, though the mix of frequencies might be a lot messier. Just like colors are usually a blend of frequencies, sounds are too. But unlike color, where a certain frequency always looks like the same hue (e.g., 440 THz light always looks red), sound doesn’t work that way. A guitar sounds like a guitar no matter what note it plays, because its timbre comes from the relationship between the overtones, not the absolute frequencies themselves. That’s why we can tell a violin from a flute, or recognize someone’s voice, or know what kind of object made a noise, based on how that sound’s overtones are structured regardless of the frequency. You can sing a high note or low note, and you will still sound like you. It is interesting to think about this from an evolutionary standpoint. Our hearing has evolved to react to frequency ratios probably because that was useful in identifying different sources, people, animals, objects, etc. This sensitivity also lets us enjoy the different tones of sound and the relationships between different pitches of sound, which is known as harmony in music. Understanding wave properties helps us better comprehend the relationship between physical vibrations and the sounds that we hear, and sketch ideas playing around with and visualizing sound. Sound visualizationSine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series Something that I think is understated, but has been a very useful insight for sketching and designing things, is that the relationship between physical quantities and their impact on human perception is logarithmic in many cases. For example, the strength of the light we feel is depends on the number of photons our eyes catch. But twice the photons doesn’t mean it feels twice as bright. Physically, a sunny day outdoors can have 200 times more light than a well-lit office. But does it feel 200 times brighter? Probably not. The same goes for sound. Loudness is related to the energy of the sound, which is directly related to the amplitude of the sound wave. But again, the relationship to the way we feel is not direct. A subway might have 100 times more sound energy than someone talking, but it doesn’t feel 100 times louder. This can be seen in a couple of ways. Life had to survive across wildly different conditions, like daylight and moonlight. So our perception systems likely evolved to compress all that information into a manageable scale. The other way to look at it is that when numbers are huge, small changes matter less. Imagine you’re stuck in traffic — a 10-minute delay feels huge when your trip is only 15 minutes, but it doesn’t matter as much if you’re going for a 5-hour drive. Similarly, adding a candle doesn’t help much when you’re already under the sun, while it can make a huge difference when you’re in a cave. Physical values and human perception Humans could have evolved more sensitive eyes like cats to see in darkness, but we haven’t. Perhaps our ancestors were not as nocturnal as cats, or they weren’t nocturnal because they didn’t have cats’ eyes. Either way, we managed to survive.There is an important nuance here. Life doesn’t evolve with purpose. A statement like “giraffes acquired long necks in order to eat leaves high up” is misleading. The reality is more like something random happened to the genes, and that change happened to give the genes themselves a better chance to be passed on to following generations. This taps into another important topic. Resolution is how detailed something can be represented or perceived. There is a certain limit to our senses regarding how small a difference we can detect, or how finely we can distinguish things from one another, and various technologies actively exploit these limitations to deliver experiences. For example, computer displays are made of small dots. But when these dots are small enough — somewhere around 300 DPI（dot per inch) at reading distance, or a viewing angle of 1 arcminute (1/60 degree) — our eyes and brain stop seeing the dots and start to see images and characters. Movies have only 24 frames per second, but that’s enough to make us believe they are smooth and real. The majority of digital audio uses 44,100 samples per second, which means a second of sound is represented by 44,100 numbers. This rate was selected because it is enough to reproduce sound up to 20,000 Hz, which is about the upper limit of pitch that humans can hear. If humans had different capabilities, these technologies could have been designed differently. An interesting part is even when there isn’t enough resolution, our brain often try to see continuity by complementing the missing details. Early monitors were much more coarse and the pixels were far more visible. But people were accepting the quality, and there is even appreciation and nostalgia for the low resolution graphics aka 8-bit style. Animations, especially cartoonish ones, can utilize a lower frame rate to add unique effects. Sometimes, letting the brain fill in the gaps is better than trying to draw everything in detail and having the illusion fall apart by having discrepancies here and there. When we sketch with code, we are always engaging with how humans perceive things. Our senses are full of quirks. They compress, filter, and interpret the raw physical world in different ways to make sense of it. Understanding how human perception works helps us see things and make things from different perspectives. It feels fascinating and freeing that when it comes to human perception, there’s no one right model, just many ways to look at things. Embrace the differences and complexity, and have fun. Humans are wired to spot patterns. Our ancestors survived by recognizing various footprints to avoid danger and find food, spots and dots on fur, rotational patterns of petals, cycles of the sun, moon, stars and repeating seasons, tides, and weather. Repeating patterns are fundamental to design and art. We see them everywhere, like in the repeating columns of ancient buildings, brick patterns, glass tiles on skyscrapers, and street pavements. Checkers, stripes, and other repeating motifs appear universally in decoration and textiles. Musicians create structure through rhythms, phrases, and chord cycles. Patterns are powerful vocabulary. Following patterns makes things predictable. It is often relaxing and comforting, but intense rhythm can also bring energy and even trance. Breaking a predictable rhythm creates tension, drawing people’s attention, and going back and forth between tension and familiar patterns is a way to drive a song or a story. At the basis of patterns is repetition. We recognize patterns because the same thing happens again and again. There are many methods to create and handle repetitions mathematically and programmatically. For example, modulo is basically a mathematical way of saying “count to n then go back to one and repeat,” which is just dividing a number by another number and taking the remainder. This is common in everyday life, like the time on a clock or the days of a week, and is a basis for many repeating patterns, such as repeating tiles and musical rhythms below. This can be easily expanded to repetition of continuous values. Repetition The sine wave is another fundamental building block for repeating patterns. A mind-blowing fact is that with an infinite set of sinusoidal waves, each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase, you can synthesize any pattern in theory. This idea is called the Fourier series for repeating patterns and the Fourier transform for ones that don’t. They are so universal and useful that you’ll bump into them in many places, such as audio and signal processing, and a whole lot of physics. Sine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series Tiling is one of the most obvious visual patterns. By repeating the same elements in a space, or dividing a space based on some rules, we can create various interesting patterns that can continue forever. The patterns can be simple repetition of the same geometric shapes to something more unique and interesting like M. C. Escher’s drawings. There are patterns that are not exactly regular and predictable like Penrose tiles or Truchet tiles. A Voronoi diagram is a method to create more organic patterns. Cells in Voronoi diagrams are all different, but humans can still see that they follow the same rules or a “pattern.” Just like when you look through a microscope, no cells in nature are exactly the same, but we can intuitively see they are the same thing regardless. Instead of dividing space, we can create musical rhythm by dividing time. Even within the same tempo and time signature, time can be divided differently, and the way you divide dictates the “feel” of the rhythm. Experienced musicians have a finely tuned resolution of time, meaning they can feel this division more granularly and accurately and precisely position their notes. Many players also adjust the timing slightly off from the exact timing naturally or intentionally to create add more nuances, such as heavy or bouncy rhythms. Resolution – Rhythm Click on “Run Pen”, then click one more time to play the sound. Music has many layers of repetition beyond basic drum loops. From guitar riffs that stick in your head to rhythmic and melodic patterns of phrases, song structure is built by repeating different sections, such as verses, bridges, and choruses. There is so much more that I can write here that we can talk about. Again, nothing follows a perfectly regular pattern. Randomness is a great tool that can help make our sketches more interesting and natural. Randomness is, by definition, hard to predict, but that doesn’t mean it’s uncontrollable. There are many different ways to “shape” randomness for your purpose. Let’s take a die as an example. A single throw of a fair die is completely unpredictable. The probability for all possible results is equal. But if you throw it twice and sum the results, you will get more 7s than 12s. The more times you throw a die, the more the sum or average will converge to a certain expected value. This is called the Law of Large Numbers. You can also apply some function to random results to adjust the distribution. For example, if you take a square of a random floating number from 0.0 to 1.0, you get this shape. Can you see the difference between these two cityscapes? These are made by using the exact same regular grid with two different functions that give them subtly different impressions. In most cities, building heights in the suburbs show little variation because nearly everything is only a few stories tall. Downtown, though, the range is much wider. While many buildings are still modest in height, a handful of skyscrapers rise far above the rest. You can think of this as a “pattern” that can repeat across many cities. Taming Randomness Noise functions are methods to get randomly but continuously changing, like the up and down of terrain, the change of temperature, or the direction an animal wanders. These are all unpredictable, but unlike dice rolls, they look smoothly connected and values next to each other seem to be somehow related. There are many noise function algorithms, but most major ones share a simple idea of smoothly connecting random numbers. So the values are random, but if you pick a point close to another, they return relatively close values, and there is no abrupt jump, or discontinuity between them. Noise functions are often layered by adding them together at different scales to create a more natural look. Imagine a mountain range. From far away, you see its jagged silhouette. As you hike closer, you start to see smaller ridges, and up close, you notice every rock face has tiny cracks and ledges that are similar to larger forms. It is quite a common pattern in nature for things to repeat similar shapes at many levels of zoom. You can find this in rolling clouds, breaking waves, cracked desert ground, leaf veins, and the shape of coastlines. Taming RandomnessReading a Noise FunctionDrawing Landscape This common pattern is called fractal. A fractal is a pattern or shape that repeats the same structure at different scales, in such a way that a part of the shape resembles the whole, and a sub-part of a part resembles the larger part. Layering of noise functions can be seen as a way to emulate the fractal nature of the real world with a finite number of computations (for example, the landscape demo above is made of 9 iterations of the same noise). Some mathematically defined fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set or Julia set, have literally infinite details. The real world is messy with infinite detail. When we see or hear things for the first time as a baby, we can’t make sense of them because they are like a raw stream of data with no structure. But as we keep experiencing similar things appear and occur, our brain starts to grasp patterns. We no longer track every speck of bark on a tree, but we just think “tree.” This is a shortcut to let us deal with overwhelming complexity and act quickly. It works the other way around, too. When information is missing, like in a blurry photo or garbled phone call, our brain tries filling the gaps with its library of familiar patterns. Resolution Does this sounds like data compression? Yes, many technologies like ZIP, JPEG, or MP3 borrow the basically same trick. They hunt for repeated structure in data, toss the redundant bits, and keep a smaller blueprint. Decompressors rebuild the original (or close enough) by reading that blueprint plus a few rules, just like our brain filling in a pixelated image. I wanted to study and write an article about information theory and data compression. I might, someday. And AI image generation. The foundational idea of diffusion models is to show the AI the process of adding noise to an image until it becomes unrecognizable, and have it learn the backward process to re-imagine plausible details of images from noise. “Pattern” is a broad word. We started from simple repetitions and reached our recognition of the noisy world. At a meta level, patterns what let us make sense of the world. They are so crucial for us to grasp and organize information. But at the same time, it is also important to remember that leaning to match on patterns can make us overlook the details that matter, sliding into stereotypes and snap judgments. We need to free ourselves from familiar patterns sometimes. A fun and useful practice is to jump between levels. Spotting big patterns while appreciating the subtle differences, nuances, and noise without falling into excessive generalizations. Master that dance and you’re using your built‑in compressor to its fullest, while staying aware of both its strengths and its traps. Yes I’m taking about both life and art. Interpolation is about estimating the values that lie between the points you already know. When you’re moving a character from point A to B, you interpolate between them so you know where the character is at a given time. You know the stock price in May and July, so you interpolate between them to estimate what the price was in June. The idea is so simple, and applicable to so many things. Let’s start from the simplest case where the value changes at the same rate all the way. Suppose that point P moves from one point A to another point B, and the variable t is the ratio how much P has moved between them. If t = 0, P is in the same position as A. If t = 1, P is in the same position as B, and if t = 0.5, P is exactly at the midpoint between A and B. This can be expressed as follows. A, B, and P can be either numbers or vectors. Interpolation and Animation – Linear Interpolation If we interpolate between points in 2D, we can draw a line segment. But things don’t always change at the same pace. To manipulate the rate, we use different functions called easing functions. Easing functions are not a clearly defined category, and they can be any function that can map a range of values (usually 0 to 1) to the same range continuously, keeping the start and end the same. MappingEasing functions On a one dimensional line, you can draw only a single path between two points, but in higher dimensions, like 2D or 3D, there are infinite ways to connect two dots. Defining a path between points in flexible but precise way is very crucial for computer graphics to draw lines and shapes. One of the most common methods called Bézier curve is basically to repeat linear interpolations multiple times. The demo below illustrates this idea. Bézier and Spline There are many different methods to draw curved lines similar to Bézier curves but with more advanced features. For example, B-spline introduces additional parameters to adjust the weights of each point to add more nuanced control over the line’s shape. Bézier and Spline – B-Spline When we draw curves, we often care how smooth they are. What smooth means can vary, but to deal with a specific kind of smoothness, there is a very useful mathematical concept called continuity. To measure how smooth a curve is in a mathematical sense, you can take the derivative of the function that represents the curve. The first derivative shows the rate of change of position, and the second derivative shows the rate of change of the rate of change. An algorithm called natural spline is designed to guarantee C2 Continuity at anywhere through a curved line goes through multiple points. While a natural spline is mathematically smooth, it may not always look like the smoothest line to human eyes. The Hobby curve algorithm minimizes curvature at each point along the line, making strokes that look like Henri Matisse’s stroke drawn with a very long brush. Controlling curves For connecting lines or interpolations smoothly, Hermite interpolation, or so-called smoothstep functions are often used. When t moves from 0 to 1, these functions can adjust the rate of change to make the derivative at the beginning and the end be zero. The first formula guarantees C1 continuity and the second one is for C2, the last one is the general form for any level of continuity. The formulas themselves are not very intuitive, but if you look at the graphs below, you can visually confirm that the rate of change becomes zero. The graph to the left shows the first derivative, and the one to the right shows the second derivative. For example, these demos for the noise functions from the Taming Randomness page use the Hermite functions. Instead of trying to control the interpolation precisely, there are methods to use algorithms to figure out the exact way to interpolate between points. This is particularly useful when there are multiple data points spread across a space. RBF interpolation is one of those methods. It solves for weights automatically and produces a smooth surface that passes through however many points you throw at it, even in higher dimensions. Take a look at the demo of RBF interpolation in 2D space. You can drag white points to play around. Continuous Mapping Interpolation is not just about moving things and drawing lines. Colors are another good example. You can mix two or more colors by interpolating between them. Your result can be different depending on which color model you use. You could even draw a curved line in a color space to get an interesting gradient. You might have seen a menu to select (re)sampling method when you are resizing an image in graphics software like Adobe Photoshop. These software programs take colors from the closest pixels and interpolate between them. In case of Photoshop, “Nearest Neighbor” means no interpolation (just pick a color from a single closest pixel), “Bilinear” linearly blends the 2 × 2 neighborhood, “Bicubic” uses a cubic function to give it C1 continuity. Mixing Colors As you might have noticed already at this point, you can interpolate between anything that can be represented as vectors. By seeing things through the lens of concepts like vectors and interpolation, we can treat many things in the same way (that is the power of abstraction). Interpolation is indeed a powerful and versatile technique to add to your toolbox. There is a very similar and related concept called extrapolation. As the name suggests, extrapolation is to extend a line beyond the ends. Extrapolation are used to predict values beyond the boundary of known data points (predict the future!). It’d be interesting to explore this topic too if you are interested. Waves are everywhere. I suppose the word originally meant just waves on the water surface, like the ocean or a lake. However, there are many other things that exhibit characteristics of waves, such as sound, earthquakes, electromagnetic waves, and light. In terms of design and graphics, wavy shapes are one of the most common patterns and are often seen in fashion, architecture, and various art and craft pieces. Wave Mathematically, the sine wave is the most fundamental wave shape. It represents the position of a point on a unit circle as the center angle changes. A sine curve can be drawn as a result of a physical object following the spring equation (Hooke’s law, F=-kx). Basically, this means if you vibrate a thing attached to a spring and plot its position over time, you get a sine curve. It is fascinating that these seemingly very different methods result in the exact same curve, which indicates that there’s something special about the sine curve (yes, it is). Waves propagate and spread in space. Many waves are mechanical, meaning they are caused by physical materials pushing against each other. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and pushes the air around, which pushes the air next to it, and so forth. Sound is propagated across a room as oscillations of air pressure this way. Earthquakes, ocean waves, etc., all belong to this category. Direction of the wavesVibration and Propagation Electromagnetic waves are a different class of wave that needs no material medium at all. Electromagnetic waves have properties of both particles (photons) and waves. Light, radio, microwaves, X‑rays, etc. are the same phenomenon at different frequencies. What oscillates is simply the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields themselves. What is light? Even without a medium, electromagnetic waves still obey the same wave physics, such as reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction. The concept of “wave” is an abstraction to capture these common characteristics between different things and phenomena. It’s not that they behave the same because they are waves, but we call them waves because they follow the same rules. For example, electromagnetic waves are diffractive, meaning that they can go around behind obstacles just like waves on the surface of water. Thanks to diffraction (along with reflection and scattering) we can watch TV or use cellular phones even when there is an obstacle between the antenna and the devices. What is light? Electromagnetic waves between about 400–800 terahertz are what we normally think of as light, and they are visible to human eyes. Depending on the frequency of light, we see different colors. Understanding how different frequencies of light interact with objects before they reach our eyes is crucial for thinking about our vision and how we model these phenomena to create graphics. Spectrum and ConesLight Sound is also a wave. When you clap your hands, pluck a string, or hit a drum, it makes the air vibrate. In the case of light, the frequency corresponds to the color. In sound, the frequency corresponds to the pitch, how high or low it sounds, and the amplitude affects the loudness. “Seeing” the sound wave helps us understand the sound a lot. For example, you can see how different frequencies of sine waves sound, or how various sounds from different instruments look. Sound visualization Musical intervals are based on frequency ratios. The equal temperament commonly used in Western music divides an octave evenly into 12 semitones. No matter where you start on the piano keyboard, the ratio of the frequency from one note to its right neighbor (e.g., C to C#) is 21/12. With the semitone as a unit, we can think of the distance between notes as a simple number relationship. Interestingly, we don’t experience pitch as just a straight line—it feels more like a spiral. For example, if you start at 440 Hz (the A note) and go up, you’ll eventually hit another A at 880 Hz at exactly double the frequency. It’s not the same sound, but we hear it as the same note, just in a higher octave. Upon these notes, we can construct different harmonies. It is all about ratio and relative relationships, and depending on how you lay them out vertically (play at the same time) or horizontally (play in sequence), you can evoke totally different feelings from the same sets of notes, or frequencies. In the slightly more song-like example below, the chord (F major 9th) chord is repeated every second time. Notice how the same chord can sound different depending on the preceding chord. Pitch and FrequencyNumbers and IntervalsThe secrets of sound (for kids) Other than the pitch and loudness, sound also has timbre, which is like the texture or color of a sound. That’s how you can tell apart different sounds, like a bird chirping, car horns, or instruments like piano and trumpet. Timbre comes from the fact that most of the sound don’t consists of a single frequency, but rather a mix of many different frequencies. And the balance between these different frequencies determines the timbre. Let’s take a guitar string as an example. When you pluck it, the string vibrates in many ways at once. The main pitch is called the fundamental frequency, but parts of the string also vibrate in smaller sections—halves, thirds, quarters, etc. These create harmonics or overtones, which are simple multiples of the base frequency. We can visualize this too. In the demo below, you can see the shape of the wave changes as we add extra sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes (the radius of the circle), in this case, getting closer to a so-called square wave. Sine waves and Additive Synthesis I wish I had added sound playback to these demos. I may try later. You can compare the sound of square wave vs. sine wave on this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave_(waveform) This bring us to the favorite topic of synthesizing everything with sine waves. If you have an infinite set of sinusoidal waves, each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase, you can synthesize any periodic pattern in theory. This idea is called the Fourier series for repeating patterns and the Fourier transform for ones that don’t. For example, an arbitrary shape, like an alphabet can be written as a Fourier series, or a series of waves. The Fourier transform is widely used in various fields such as sound processing, signal processing, and image compression. By applying Fourier transform to sound data, we can determine the amount of different frequencies contained within it. This lets us manipulate the data by reducing or increasing a certain range of frequencies. Sine waves and Additive SynthesisFourier Series The Navier-Stokes equations describe the properties and behavior of media such as water and air, including mass conservation, momentum conservation, and viscosity. This is a fundamental theory that explains how waves work in these media, but that’s not all. In computer graphics, these equations are often used for fluid simulation. Understanding and simulating waves using the Navier-Stokes equations can be a fun and interesting research topic. Fluid Simulation Shapes seem like an obvious topic. Since they are ubiquitous, we take them for granted. Many tools provide ways to draw shapes, and many of them are pretty simple, like these functions in p5.js. But as soon as we look more closely, things get complicated. In fact, there are infinite ways to define and draw shapes, and most of the shapes in the wild, from industrial products to nature, have so many nuances. Let’s start with geometric shapes that are (relatively) easier to define mathematically and handle with code. It is easy to draw line segments, circles, etc. in various environments including HTML canvas. However, it is not so easy to draw figures like those in geometry textbooks. Even a simple operation such as drawing a circle around the intersection of two straight lines requires a bit of calculation. The ability to draw a picture and the ability to handle geometry mathematically are two different things. Of course, there are many well-designed libraries out there, but it is also a good learning experience to implement basic functions by yourself. Well it was at least for myself. Geometric Drawings Understanding basic shapes gives us a foundation for drawing many other more complex shapes. You might have experience in drawing shapes with just a compass and ruler in math class. It is sometimes fun to limit your tools and play within the constraints. It is fascinating to see we can create pretty complex shapes just with circles and lines. Geometric Drawings – Other drawings Geometric shapes are widely used in our design. Repeating them in patterns is a major vocabulary of decorative and graphic design. Since ancient times, people have been crafting intriguing patterns by repeating graphic elements or organizing space based on specific rules. Tiling Not just for directly drawing shapes, we often use geometric shapes as proxies for more complex shapes as well. A good example of this is collision detection in games and 3D simulations where we want to detect object intersections. We usually use basic shapes like circles, triangles, rectangles, and combinations of them to approximate complex shapes at different precisions as needed. If you’re making a NES game, Mario can be just a rectangle. If you’re making a 3D fighting game, you might want boxes to represent a character’s body, upper and lower arms, fists, etc. separately. A human can tell if two figures overlap or not at a glance. But it is difficult to solve this generally with a computer, and different problems often require different tricks. Various methods of checking whether figures overlap are used to detect collisions between objects in physics simulations and games. You may rely on the functions of existing tools and libraries in actual projects. But knowing the basics will not only help you understand these tools but will also enable you to quickly implement only the functions you need yourself. Detecting Collision The linked page above (Detecting Collision) only covers collision detection in 2D. 3D collision detection can be much more intricate, but understanding in 2D can extend and help a lot in 3D too. Below is a simple reference I found for 3D. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection?utm_source=chatgpt.com While straight lines are much easier to handle, curves are the norm on Earth. Nature doesn’t have many straight lines. Almost nothing goes straight, except for light. Curves are obviously a very essential tool for sketching. However, unlike straight lines, which can be defined with just two points and a linear formula, curves have infinite possibilities and are much harder to handle. There have been many different methods of defining or drawing curves, each with its own advantages, disadvantages, and constraints. Cumulative Curves One of the most common ways that curves occur in the physical world is through cumulative motion or buildup, meaning a point starts moving from one location and changes its course over time. This can include freehand drawing, paths followed by insects, animals, vehicles, and the growth patterns of plants and other organisms. While the cumulative approach is straightforward and versatile in theory, it is often not the best for many practical use cases where you want more precise control over the overall shape and details, such as in drawing or design tools. These tools usually adopt parametric approaches. In the parametric approach, a shape or curve is defined mathematically using one or more parameters. By varying these parameters, you can generate points that make up the shape. For example, if the parameter is called t, you can get all the points from beginning to end by moving t within a certain range. Parametric Approaches Among parametric approaches, there is a category of methods that are designed to define curved lines freely and precisely with multiple control points. These methods are widely used in design tools such as Adobe Illustrator or Figma, CAD, 3D modeling tools, and others. A spline curve is a mathematically defined curve that smoothly passes through or is close to a series of control points. It is like a big family, and there are many variations including Bézier curves, B-spline curves, NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), Cardinal Splines, Catmull-Rom Splines, Hermite Splines, etc. Bézier and Spline When we talk about shapes, it is important to discuss their quality, not just methods, since after all, we are sketching to express something. Curves can have various visual characteristics. For example, some curves might look more organic and natural, while others might appear more geometric and mechanical. How can we create these different looks of curves? There is another very different category of defining shapes than drawing outlines. “Signed distance functions”, or SDF sounds scary but it is not too crazy to understand. A SDF is a function that can tell you how far a point is from a surface of a shape, say a sphere (usually in Euclidean space) For example the distance of a point of from the surface of a sphere can be expressed as below where p is the coordinate of the point, c is the center of the sphere, and r is the radius: Signed distance functions This is very interesting because SDF is the technique used as basis for many mind-blowing 3D graphics demos with really small amount of code you often find on ShaderToy. Using this method in 3D, you can create different shapes pretty flexibly with a relatively short amount of code using shaders. Projection and 3D Rendering Reading “Raymarching – Primitives” Shaders and 3D rendering have a very steep learning curve. There isn’t a common or obvious way to build knowledge step by step, and it takes learning from multiple resources and examples. Shadertoy is one of the best resources with tons of cool demos with publicly available code. However, understanding this demo code can often be daunting. There are many techniques to grasp, and it’s often difficult to understand what’s happening in the code at first glance. There isn’t really a shortcut here (as far as I know). Studying demo codes step by step, a little by little is the best way. Two following pages are my attempt to help with the journey. Drawing Landscape The landscape example just above shows a lot more intricate and organic shape than other shapes we have been seeing on so far. Many naturally occurring shapes follow a pattern called a fractal, where a shape repeats its structure at different scales. In fractals, parts of the shape resemble the whole, while smaller parts resemble the larger parts. This property, called self-similarity, is key to modeling many complex structures and patterns found in nature, such as coastlines, mountains, clouds, and tree branches. Objects and lives in nature often to form fractal-like structures in the process of building themselves, where similar patterns recur at progressively smaller or larger scales. Understanding this principle can help us sketch them. Fractal Natural shapes are also unpredictable. The ups and downs of terrain, the changes in temperature, or the directions animals wander towards all seem random, but they look smoothly connected too, and values next to each other seem to be somehow related. Noise functions are the go-to methods for this, and we often overlay multiple layers of noise functions in a fractal manner (scale and add) to get desired complexity. Taming Randomness Reading a Noise Function As I said in the beginning, there are infinite ways of defining and drawing shapes. A couple of major topics I didn’t touch upon are: That said, if you’re interested, I recommend building basic tools yourself to learn the fundamentals. Even trying to render a few polygons can provide good insights (hint: project 3D points to 2D screen, calculate normals using cross product of vectors, and apply lighting). All of these sections were originally published as introductory articles, or maps of things in my mind, to provide overviews of different topics in Sketching with Code from different angles. Most of the contents is from Sketching with Math and Quasi Physics (2019), and the other workshop materials or self-educational notes. The majority of them were originally in English, but some were in Japanese first. The translations were done with the help of AI in both directions. I used p5.js for most of the code samples, unless otherwise noted. However, I tried to write them in a way that can be applied to any environment as much as possible. I am not a mathematician or computer engineer. This is simply a compilation of ideas that I have found useful from the perspective of a visually oriented person. If you notice any mistakes, have better examples, or know of links that would aid in learning, please share them with me. In this context, I am less interested in show-off demos, so please refrain from providing tweet-length shaders or similar content. Hope you enjoyed these intros.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand as Nvidia remains at the forefront of ... More next-gen computing. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) stands at a pivotal moment as it prepares to release its first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings on May 28, 2025. The semiconductor giant has transformed from a gaming graphics company into the backbone of AI infrastructure worldwide. However, recent stock performance and mounting geopolitical challenges have investors questioning whether Nvidia remains a compelling investment opportunity. This analysis examines Nvidia's year-to-date performance, key earnings metrics, macroeconomic headwinds and expert sentiment. With Wall Street projecting record revenue of $43.3 billion alongside a significant $5.5 billion writeoff related to China restrictions, the earnings report promises to be closely watched. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors considering their position before results are unveiled. Nvidia's 2025 journey has been marked by volatility, with shares trading approximately 5% lower year-to-date as of late May. The year began with turbulence when Chinese startup DeepSeek released a cost-effective AI model that challenged Big Tech's AI infrastructure spending assumptions. This development and signals from Microsoft regarding potential slowdowns in AI data center investments created uncertainty about Nvidia's growth sustainability. Geopolitical tensions have further complicated the stock performance under the Trump administration. Trade restrictions resulted in export bans on Nvidia's specialized chips to China, with CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging these policies cost the company approximately $15 billion in sales. The subsequent $5.5 billion write-off of H20 inventory designed for the Chinese market represents a tangible impact on Nvidia's financials. Despite challenges, Nvidia maintains exceptional financial strength, with $38.5 billion in cash versus $8.5 billion in debt. Recent developments, including expansion into Saudi Arabia and the UAE and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeal of certain chip trade restrictions, have provided positive momentum. Options traders are pricing in potential movements of up to 7.4% following earnings, reflecting continued volatility expectations. Nvidia's earnings will be scrutinized across multiple dimensions, with investors seeking insights into near-term performance and long-term positioning. The company has historically beaten quarterly guidance while providing forward estimates exceeding consensus. However, these "beat-and-raise" scenarios have become less dramatic as Wall Street caught up with Nvidia's trajectory. The earnings call will be crucial for understanding how to navigate geopolitical challenges while capitalizing on AI demand. Supply constraints remain the primary U.S. growth limitation, while international expansion strategies are critical for offsetting substantial China revenue loss. CEO Jensen Huang's commentary on competitive positioning and customer diversification will provide vital future insights. Wall Street projects record quarterly revenue of $43.3 billion for Q1 fiscal 2026, representing 66% growth versus $26 billion last year. While impressive, this means decelerating from the prior year's 262% revenue growth. Earnings per share are expected at $0.73, up from $0.61 year-over-year, with some analysts projecting adjusted EPS of $0.88, a 44% increase. These projections must consider the $5.5 billion H20 inventory write-off impacting reported results despite underlying business strength. Historical data shows that Nvidia shareholders who purchased before earnings and held for 12 months achieved median returns of 120% over the past decade. However, as always, given evolving competitive and regulatory landscapes, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Data center revenue represents Nvidia's crown jewel, growing from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $115 billion in fiscal 2025. This segment exited recent quarters with $35.6 billion revenue and $142 billion annualized run rate. Morningstar models $40 billion for April 2025, but reduced July estimates from $44 billion to $37.6 billion due to China restrictions. Supply constraints continue limiting Nvidia's demand fulfillment ability. Analysts expect incremental quarterly growth of approximately $4 billion through fiscal 2026, driven by additional supply and continued AI adoption. Growth sustainability depends on broader AI infrastructure investment trends and customer base diversification beyond hyperscale cloud providers. AI demand remains Nvidia's fundamental growth driver, dominating GPU provision for AI training and inference workloads. The CUDA software platform creates significant switching costs, establishing competitive advantages beyond hardware. However, recent developments, including DeepSeek's model and scaling law debates, have introduced questions about AI investment sustainability. Nvidia's unique position provides superior AI trend visibility across industries. The earnings call will reveal whether AI investment slowdown concerns are materializing or demand remains robust across customer segments and regions. Expansion beyond cloud providers into government and sovereign initiatives, particularly in the Middle East, could provide significant diversification benefits. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell architecture represents a critical future growth strategy, offering significant performance improvements over Hopper chips. Launch timing and execution face competitive pressure from semiconductor rivals and custom cloud provider chips. Early adoption, production schedules, and pricing will indicate Nvidia's ability to maintain technological leadership and premium positioning. Blackwell's strategic importance extends beyond immediate revenue, demonstrating continued innovation and commitment to evolving AI workload requirements. Supply chain execution is critical, given that historical demand exceeds supply for new generations. Success could offset China revenue headwinds while reinforcing Nvidia's preferred AI infrastructure provider position. The AI chip competitive landscape evolves rapidly, with major cloud providers investing in custom silicon while traditional semiconductor companies expand AI portfolios. Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Google's TPUs, and Microsoft/Meta design plans represent direct threats. AMD aggressively expands GPU lineups for cloud customers, while Intel develops AI accelerator products. Nvidia's competitive strategy extends beyond hardware to software, networking and services, creating comprehensive ecosystems that are difficult to replicate. However, major customers' desire to diversify suppliers and reduce single-vendor dependence represents structural challenges. Maintaining the pace of innovation while preserving switching costs through software advantages will determine sustained market position and premium valuations. U.S.-China geopolitical tensions represent the most significant macroeconomic headwind, with trade restrictions fundamentally altering Nvidia's addressable market. The Trump administration's export controls effectively blocked access to one of the world's largest AI markets. The $15 billion in lost sales represents just the beginning, as China's domestic semiconductor industry develops competitive alternatives like Huawei. Broader trade tension implications extend beyond direct restrictions to supply chain vulnerabilities and technology transfer concerns. Given Taiwan tensions, Nvidia's TSMC reliance on advanced production creates additional geopolitical risk. Middle East expansion attempts to diversify geographically, but newer markets may not offset the Chinese business scale. Reciprocal tariff threats could impact broader technology sector sentiment. Global economic conditions influence Nvidia through enterprise IT spending and AI startup venture capital impacts. Higher interest rates can reduce speculative AI investment appetite while slowing industry adoption. However, Nvidia shows remarkable economic cycle resilience, with AI infrastructure investment appearing relatively insensitive to traditional indicators. Well-capitalized customer bases provide some economic downturn insulation. Morningstar assigns Nvidia a 3-star "fairly valued" rating based on a $125 fair value estimate, suggesting the current $132-135 trading represents a slight overvaluation. The analysis acknowledges the potential for a higher fundamental value if geopolitical concerns diminish or AI demand proves more durable. The wide economic moat rating reflects confidence in competitive advantages, while the "Very High" uncertainty rating acknowledges AI market nascency and geopolitical complications. Wall Street sentiment remains generally positive despite challenges, with $43.3 billion consensus revenue projections showing continued growth confidence. However, decelerating growth rates and a focus on execution challenges suggest the "easy money" AI expansion phase may be ending. Analysts increasingly focus on navigating supply constraints, competitive pressures and geopolitical headwinds while maintaining premium pricing. Market indicators suggest continued volatility, with options pricing implying significant post-earnings movement potential. Historically strong 12-month pre-earnings buyer returns provide long-term investor comfort, but changing competitive and regulatory environments may limit historical trend applicability. Given concentrated Nvidia holdings among major index funds, institutional investor behavior will be closely watched. Bottom Line Nvidia looks like a clear buy heading into earnings, with strong fundamentals, dominant AI leadership and the potential to outperform if growth holds steady. Record revenue expectations underscore continued demand, and despite its $5.5 billion China write-off, the company remains at the forefront of next-gen computing. Still, risks remain. Geopolitical pressures, export restrictions and growing competition could affect future performance. While the stock appears reasonably valued, any upside will depend on Nvidia’s ability to maintain its technological edge and weather a more complex global environment.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is up nearly 45% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the broader Nasdaq index, down 1%. This strong performance is largely due to the company’s rising sales, up 40% in the last twelve months. A major driver of this growth is Broadcom's AI product line, which saw an impressive 220% year-over-year increase in revenue to $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, fueled by high demand for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is strategically positioned to capitalize on the generative AI surge with its extensive suite of networking, storage, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Considering this strong performance, we believe AVGO stock is a good buy at its current price of around $230. While its current valuation is extremely high, making it sensitive to adverse events, we see minimal cause for concern. Our conclusion is based on comparing AVGO's current valuation with its recent operating performance and its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key parameters—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—shows that Broadcom has a very strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also, see – What Sparked UNH Stock Crash? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been less resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: AVGO stock has performed exceptionally well across these parameters. While the stock's valuation is currently high, it appears justifiable given its massive sales growth and solid operating cash flow margins of around 40%. Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock remains attractive, supporting our conclusion that AVGO is a good buy. However, investors should be aware of certain risks. The stock's high valuation makes it more prone to significant declines during adverse events, as demonstrated by its larger corrections than the broader market in two of the last three market crashes. Additionally, any slowdown in AI spending by companies would directly impact Broadcom's growth. Overall, investors should carefully consider these potential risks before investing in AVGO. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Employees are sick and tired of 'engagement surveys' at work

Time Published: 2025-05-27T08:17:01Z

"Satisfaction surveys" promise to make offices happier. Do they work? Iwas in a particularly sour mood at an old job one afternoon when a notification popped up in Slack, reminding me to fill out my Peakon, the employee engagement survey our HR department used. In exchange for our candor, the HR team promised total anonymity and assured us that our concerns and comments would be heard by top brass. I liked my job, so I typically filled these surveys out with a perfunctory four-out-of-five-star acquiescence, never eager to rock the boat. I truly cannot recall now what had made my day so bad, but I decided to take it out on the survey. In response to extremely mundane questions about my daily motivation and whether my work goals were clearly defined, I said things like this organization absolutely stinks and our customers are marks. I was specific without revealing my identity, but I lurched roundhouse kicks like no sane person would work here if they had a better option. With the vitriol of an anonymous Yelp reviewer, I let 'er rip. It felt amazing — in the moment. The next morning, I found in my inbox a letter from the CEO. Sent via Peakon, it said something to the effect of, I can't tell who you are. But it seems you're unhappy. I have an offer for you. If I identified myself and then resigned, they'd give me a bit more than a standard severance. My resignation would be written as a layoff, so I could collect unemployment, and they'd even hook me up with the external recruiters they used to staff the company, to help me find a better role in some place where I would be happier. My employer was not doing layoffs or buyouts, and no one else, to my knowledge, had gotten this kind of offer. It seemed the object of my unhappiness at work had struck a nerve. While you may have a manager who genuinely loves you and wants you to be happy, the reality is that from an organizational perspective, your happiness at work has a literal, and hefty, price tag. Companies spend a fortune finding and hiring talent; it can cost 15% to 25% of a role's salary to source the right person to fill an opening. Maybe my old CEO (who through a representative declined to comment for this story) agreed strongly with the market firm MSW's survey that found that disengaged workers are 2.5 times as likely as an engaged worker to leave a company, and he just wanted me to get on with it. A Gallup survey found that about one-third of US workers were "actively engaged" at work in 2023, with the larger pool of less engaged and "actively disengaged" workers (who make mistakes at work more often and show up to work less often) accounting for an estimated $1.9 trillion in lost productivity. Our "engagement" — the quality by which work feels immediate and meaningful — was defined as recently as 1990 by the Boston University professor of organizational behavior William Kahn, whose studies around employee engagement transformed how corporations think about workforce productivity. Employees who are not able to engage with their jobs are rendered "emotionally, cognitively and psychologically unavailable," as Kahn has put it. Negative and positive engagement is now considered an indicator of both positive and negative lagging effects for businesses, including profitability, turnover, and employee absenteeism. So for the last 35 years, HR departments everywhere have created a culture of questionnaires determined to uncover, isolate, and nurture their company's engagement. There's a very good chance you've been pinged and asked sometime in the past few months to fill out your Deel engagement survey, or your ThriveSparrow, SurveyMonkey, Workleap, Paycom, Lattice, People Element, or Engagedly. Software companies generated almost a billion dollars in 2023 selling and administering third-party engagement surveys to corporations everywhere. Peakon sold to Workday in 2021 for $700 million. A 2021 fundraising round catapulted the Melbourne, Australia-founded engagement startup Culture Amp to unicorn status, with a $1.5 billion valuation. The action is picking up, as increasingly dispersed post-COVID workforces have exacerbated the need for more vibe checks. If you're in the business of soliciting opinions from employees, business is booming. Less satisfied with employee satisfaction surveys are many of the employees taking them. Some two-thirds of US employees believe their companies don't respond to engagement surveys in a meaningful way, according to a Quantum Workplace survey of more than a thousand workers. "Employee surveys mostly seem like a way for the executive suite to pat themselves on the back," Nick Gaudio, the creative director at the Austin-based chatbot startup Manychat, tells me. "They want to believe in the power of anonymity to induce honesty, but at the end of the day, the power dynamic is always there, hanging over the head of their employees." While I experienced a surprising assertion of this power dynamics firsthand — my bosses didn't like my answers, and tried to do something about it — in general, the people I spoke to for this story placed surveys in the taxonomic rank of workplace annoyances somewhere around "filling out timesheets." Surveys can be annoying because they're persistent, doubly so when you perceive that your employers won't do much with the results. This can lead to survey fatigue, where the response rate falls off a cliff after being asked to submit too many. When you're constantly filing your anonymous grievances into an anonymous digital suggestion box, you may begin to wonder not if the survey will help improve your workplace, but if you aren't perhaps participating in a kind of "snitchware." Are you voluntarily telling on yourself? If we survey the history of surveys, we find that they were once considered novel, exciting, and based in real utility, much as the kanban project management board was born out of a working system in a real factory. Before World War I, most bosses were primarily concerned with their employees' external lives and work outcomes — the inner toils and happiness quotients mattered very little, as the historian Sanford Jacoby wrote in a 2008 paper called "Employee Attitude Surveys in Historical Perspective." But strikes and wartime labor shortages gave the workforce some modicum of power. This gave the educational psychologist J. David Houser the perfect platform to take the "consumer attitude studies" he'd been doing on behalf of public utilities into an entirely new field of study: employee satisfaction and morale. By the early 1940s, satisfaction surveys found a champion in the armed forces. Because soldier morale began to be considered paramount to defense success, the military took the results of personnel surveys seriously. This led to some drastic changes, including introducing combat badges, requiring psychological evaluations for returned soldiers, and even helping along the eventual desegregation of the armed forces. (Today, the government's Office of Personnel Management notably conducts agency- and government-wide surveys as a resource for the public trust.) Decades later, Kahn, "the godfather of employee engagement," set up a brilliant framework for understanding employee satisfaction outside the binary of happy/sad. That same anonymity that Gaudio railed against can also promote a kind of equity. Jenna Eichberg, the chief people officer at AlertMedia, tells me that because surveys aggregate an entire organization's feedback, you don't have to overindex your worry about the loudest outliers. "You can't chase one person. You're here to serve a majority of your workforce," she says, and the beauty of the big dataset is that you can hear just as much from shy employees, or from "people who're different than the ones who mostly talk to you in person." Phil Wilburn, the VP of people analytics at Workday, agrees. A survey, he tells me over email, "gives people who might not feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting — whether they're introverted, more junior, or part of an underrepresented group — a safe space to share their thoughts. And it helps managers respond to those concerns thoughtfully, without putting anyone on the spot." Still, Eichberg says, if your employees don't feel heard, it's because you're not making them feel heard. "The biggest mistake organizations make is they do all these surveys and they collect all this data, but they don't actually do something with it," she says. "Or they do something with it, and they don't go back and tell their workforce what they did with it." The head of people at a small LA-based startup tells me that his organization similarly seems to freeze whenever a surprising result or answer pops out of the survey black box. "I tell my CEO that by the time a comment winds up in the survey, it's already tried to reach you some other way," he says. Surveys, he continues, are "only as good as the relationships between the people in the company and only as effective as the executives who have to do something about it." So while anonymity can lend itself to candor and equity, it might still sometimes fail in the way of promoting actual conversation and trust. Consider a 2021 survey from The Workforce Institute that found that only 37% of entry-level employees believe their colleagues are completely honest in their answers and assessments. If 43% of workers fear retaliation for speaking up at work, per a survey from the Institute of Business Ethics, anonymity can only help so much. In the same way remote employees have learned to keep their Slack icon "green," to avoid suspicion of blowing off work, some workers have self-taught to never be entirely honest with their HR surveys. Last year at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy issued a memo requiring five-days-a-week RTO, touching on connection and communication as principal tenets for this decision. Enough workers were dissatisfied enough to launch their own internal survey about RTO, an ironic Uno reverse card usage of the employee questionnaire to critique how little they felt the self-declared "Earth's Best Employer" was listening. A former boss once lamented to me that surveys are, by design, akin to "interviewing for pain" — regardless of their intention, they tend to draw out complaints and gripes that aren't as serious as they seem. This may be true, but when you consider the total anonymity of the survey, how is a boss supposed to tell the genuine complaint from the Reddit-like bloviating? In a work world with increasingly labyrinthine and opaque hiring processes, the crisis of "ghost jobs," and built on the legacy of Michael Scott hating Toby, it's not surprising that we're mired in an ongoing HR credibility crisis, with so many workers rejecting the supposed efficacy and value of something as supposedly useful as surveys. When I ask William Kahn about this hierarchical arrangement and fear of self-reporting, he tells me that "ideally, there would be no need for surveys that are in the service of helping managers understand the experiences, thoughts, and insights of their workers." In an open, trusting workplace, he says, "communication would flow freely based on the idea that the work and healthy relationships matter more than the need of managers to be adored and obeyed." Even so, he adds, "surveys would still be useful to get quick checks on the results of interventions designed to enable workers to fully engage their work." I ended up not taking my CEO's stunning buyout offer. I was a diligent, productive, and engaged worker, and I believe the CEO was conflating and confusing this engagement with my happiness. Kahn tells me that "highly engaged members are satisfied with their roles and experiences," but "whether they are 'happy' or not — which has as much to do with the totality of their lives — is a different matter." More importantly, that CEO seemed to see the survey results as an end point, evidence of some unfixable condition, and not some part of a workforce to maintain, nurture, and encourage. They supposed that if only we could have more engaged workers, we'd be better off, without contending that the survey revealed opportunity, not a definitive answer. It was, ironically, the moment I thought of most often when I did make the decision to leave the following year. Matt Alston's writing has appeared in Wired, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and Believer.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google’s AI updates are portent of antitrust cases to come

Full Content:
This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Alphabet’s AI advancements continue to wow Wall Street, but they’re raising eyebrows with regulators in Washington, D.C., and last week’s launches at Google Marketing Live should cause advertisers on Madison Avenue to reserve judgment. Despite several tussles with the Justice Department and hand-wringing over the fate of third-party cookies, the company’s stock price popped last week, as the markets gauged Alphabet’s revenue plans following the Google I/O and Google Marketing Live announcements. The Google Marketing Live updates include several AI-powered advertising products and capabilities across Search and YouTube (see below). The offerings focus on simplifying creative production, enhancing targeting precision, heralding predictive intelligence, with Google’s Vidya Srinivasan, vp and general manager, ads & commerce, Google, claiming they can “remove the guesswork and drive measurable impact.” Key product launches and capabilities include: These product updates reflect Google’s broader strategy to embed AI across the advertising lifecycle — from discovery and creative to delivery and performance — making ads more relevant, actionable, and efficient. When Google speaks, the entire advertising industry should listen, but as several disclosures in the antitrust trials of the last two years show, this should never be in an obsequious manner. Several Digiday sources attempted to read between the lines of Google’s product announcements last week, and concluded that it is trying to define measurement and control optimization as the AI wars with Big Tech continue. This is the playbook that led to its colossal success, and some fear history may repeat itself. Nathan Woodman, founder of Proof-in-Data, observed how the two key innovations, i.e., new AI formats enhancing user experience and measurement tools like AI Max, although he warned the tools may prioritize Google’s revenue growth over advertisers’ success. “There’s a lot of people who have a problem with handing the keys over to Google,” said Woodman. “In many cases, you get the people inside an organization doing the media buying, they look at the dashboard, they look at the screen… they can lose a critical eye as to what’s happening.” According to Woodman, who formerly held senior roles at several digital media agencies, this can lead to “a GPS-effect,” a phenomenon whereby “the GPS is telling you where to go, but you don’t really look around.” Several sources noted that while the potential for the latest announcements to help marketers is clear, but questioning the provenance of these news systems is critical, as “blindly following the GPS is detrimental.” Key questions to ask Google about its AI systems Digiday sources advised marketers to interrogate the below issues when considering the latest Google AI tools. This is because Google’s strategy involves integrating AI agents to control budgets, bids, planning, and creative decisions, and Google has a proven track record for favoring its own systems. Robert Webster, CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, noted how Microsoft and Google are positioning their tools to control the web, with this competition likely to prove a concern at Google HQ as many doubt its ability to monetize search in the AI-era compared to its earlier fortunes. “What everyone is fighting to be is the orchestration layer… where you use their agents to do things,” he added. “Microsoft’s hook is that everyone has a license for Word and Excel, so you’ll use them to do it. Google’s hook is that you spend most of your money with Google, you’ll want to use their agents to connect to Google Ads and your data seamlessly.” Webster, formerly a senior executive at WPP’s media investment arm, notes that this AI arms race should cause concern among regulators — Bloomberg likewise reported such DOJ scrutiny last week — with the concerns raised about Google’s AI an echo of those documented in the most recent antitrust case. “From a DOJ point of view, isn’t that a control game… these agents will do things like decide budgets, decide bids, decide planning, and what creative to run,” observed Webster. “If they’re built on Google systems, will Google be able to tweak them to help Google?” “Everything is broken, because it’s designed to be that way… There’s a lot of people out there who are just afraid to ask the right questions, and AI is only going to intensify that.” – A veteran media agency exec discusses how history seems to be repeating itself at the recent Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit, where agency execs grumbled over measurement and attribution. WTF just happened to the IAB Europe’s TCF — and what does it mean for targeted ads in the EU? Perplexity is burning through cash, quickly While the AI-powered search engine has been able to increase its subscription revenue and users in the past 12 months, that growth has come at a large cost. According to The Information, Perplexity generated $34 million in revenue in 2024, but burned through $65 million in cash, which was spent on cloud servers and AI models which power much of its answers. Meta’s attempt to get its antitrust case thrown out failed The FTC’s battle against Meta kicked off on April 14, but Meta has since tried to have the case thrown out. However, on May 20, Judge Boasberg denied Meta’s motion, which asked him to rule against the FTC before it had even launched its defense case, according to The Verge. As TikTok’s U.S. existence is still in limbo, Shop staff are being laid off U.S. TikTok Shop staff were told to work from home on May 21, as they waited to receive emails regarding “difficult decisions,” which everyone understood to mean job cuts, according to Bloomberg.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google’s AI updates are portent of antitrust cases to come

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Alphabet’s AI advancements continue to wow Wall Street, but they’re raising eyebrows with regulators in Washington, D.C., and last week’s launches at Google Marketing Live should cause advertisers on Madison Avenue to reserve judgment. Despite several tussles with the Justice Department and hand-wringing over the fate of third-party cookies, the company’s stock price popped last week, as the markets gauged Alphabet’s revenue plans following the Google I/O and Google Marketing Live announcements. The Google Marketing Live updates include several AI-powered advertising products and capabilities across Search and YouTube (see below). The offerings focus on simplifying creative production, enhancing targeting precision, heralding predictive intelligence, with Google’s Vidya Srinivasan, vp and general manager, ads & commerce, Google, claiming they can “remove the guesswork and drive measurable impact.” Key product launches and capabilities include: These product updates reflect Google’s broader strategy to embed AI across the advertising lifecycle — from discovery and creative to delivery and performance — making ads more relevant, actionable, and efficient. When Google speaks, the entire advertising industry should listen, but as several disclosures in the antitrust trials of the last two years show, this should never be in an obsequious manner. Several Digiday sources attempted to read between the lines of Google’s product announcements last week, and concluded that it is trying to define measurement and control optimization as the AI wars with Big Tech continue. This is the playbook that led to its colossal success, and some fear history may repeat itself. Nathan Woodman, founder of Proof-in-Data, observed how the two key innovations, i.e., new AI formats enhancing user experience and measurement tools like AI Max, although he warned the tools may prioritize Google’s revenue growth over advertisers’ success. “There’s a lot of people who have a problem with handing the keys over to Google,” said Woodman. “In many cases, you get the people inside an organization doing the media buying, they look at the dashboard, they look at the screen… they can lose a critical eye as to what’s happening.” According to Woodman, who formerly held senior roles at several digital media agencies, this can lead to “a GPS-effect,” a phenomenon whereby “the GPS is telling you where to go, but you don’t really look around.” Several sources noted that while the potential for the latest announcements to help marketers is clear, but questioning the provenance of these news systems is critical, as “blindly following the GPS is detrimental.” Key questions to ask Google about its AI systems Digiday sources advised marketers to interrogate the below issues when considering the latest Google AI tools. This is because Google’s strategy involves integrating AI agents to control budgets, bids, planning, and creative decisions, and Google has a proven track record for favoring its own systems. Robert Webster, CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, noted how Microsoft and Google are positioning their tools to control the web, with this competition likely to prove a concern at Google HQ as many doubt its ability to monetize search in the AI-era compared to its earlier fortunes. “What everyone is fighting to be is the orchestration layer… where you use their agents to do things,” he added. “Microsoft’s hook is that everyone has a license for Word and Excel, so you’ll use them to do it.

May 26, 2025 21:54 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, May 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether officers and directors of DoubleVerify breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. NAPCO Securities Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current NAPCO Securities Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held NAPCO shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) NAPCO failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) NAPCO downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) NAPCO’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, NAPCO would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against NAPCO and the underwriter defendants.” “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held NAPCO shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

(NASDAQ: PCRX) shares since prior to August 2, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/pacira-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of Pacira breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. Why: A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Pacira, via certain of its officers, disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts concerning the validity and scope of the Company's patents. On August 9, 2024, Pacira announced that the New Jersey District Court had invalidated its ‘495 patent. This announcement surprised investors and analysts alike as they reacted immediately to the revelations, and the price of Pacira’s common stock declined dramatically. What You Can Do Now: Current Pacira shareholders who have held Pacira shares since prior to August 2, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Treace Medical Concepts, Inc.

Title: Mitsotakis’ fury (with the Council of State), ND’s proposal regarding Karamanlis, OnlyFans girls beware of the AADE, National Bank’s deals, and Sorras’ coffee machine
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/05/26/mitsotakis-fury-with-the-council-of-state-nds-proposal-regarding-karamanlis-onlyfans-girls-beware-of-the-aade-national-banks-deals-and-sorras-coffee-machine/
Time Published: 2025-05-26T13:38:22Z
Full Content:
Greetings, so the source is one of the best I have at M.M., so I don’t think they would mislead me when they told me the following yesterday: “The Prime Minister is furious about this case, where the Council of State suddenly turned people’s plots into fields (properties on the edges of settlements with less than 2,000 inhabitants), because as he himself says, it is not possible for us to have a huge demographic as well as housing problem – especially in the provinces but also generally throughout Greece – and for the state to…eat up people’s property overnight. Really, where did the judges remember this from, dating back to 1983 when the relevant legislation has been in effect until today?” the source concluded. They also told me that “Mitsotakis is not going to let this go under any circumstances and will exhaust all pressure and options in favor of the ownership of these plots.” The truth is we are talking about an absolute exaggeration and a major injustice. Mitsotakis’ Tours What with the generally good weather, and what with the improvement of the political climate in favor of ND, K.M. has decided to leave Maximos more and more often, touring Attica and beyond. On Saturday he was in Megara, where he spoke to citizens, while his schedule includes a tour in Evia this coming Thursday. According to the program, he will go to Aliveri and to the inauguration of the carbon capture and storage station at the AGET plant. The Proposal and Karamanlis Today or tomorrow, ND is expected to submit its proposal for the preliminary investigation concerning Kostas Karamanlis, on charges of breach of duty as a misdemeanor. I understand that on the same day there will also be some statement from the former minister. The legal document is being finalized, and there will be a reference to Christos Spirtzis, but no prosecution will be made due to the statute of limitations. OnlyFans – Girls and the AADE So, I hear from one of my sources in tax affairs that the OnlyFans business is booming in Greece too, with all social media – mainly TikTok but also Instagram – full of Greek or even foreign girls advertising the world’s oldest profession. And we’re talking about earnings in the range of 15–20 thousand euros per month, not bad at all especially when it’s tax-free. Now, for this to be circulating in the tax authorities, it doesn’t seem like good news for the girls. Audits are coming… The Banks Hit the Markets for Senior Bonds And now onto market news, starting with the banks which are ready this week and next to run senior bond issuances as part of the MREL framework. The time has come, and after all, all banks, systemic and non-systemic, have announced their intentions during the presentation of their quarterly results. The planning for the entire year is for issues totaling around 2.5 billion euros, which concern the replacement of older maturing bonds or refinancing of issues where such an option is foreseen. Banks are accelerating their moves because interest rates have dropped significantly, but mainly because markets are volatile and investors particularly cautious and selective. Moreover, in these issuances the competition is international, as according to the EBA, in 2025 across Europe the following issuances are expected: 262 billion in senior preferred, 107 billion in senior non-preferred, 18 billion in AT1, and 37 billion in Tier 2 bonds. Timing is always critical, so get ready for announcements from Greek banks entering the markets. The Swiss Franc Loan Arrangement is Delayed (but in the works) The Finance Ministry is not ready yet, but promoting a regulation for loans in Swiss francs is a matter of time. A political mandate has been given from M.M., which (rightly) believes that the Government must maintain continuity and that promises must be implemented, regardless of changes in personnel. The banks are under the (mistaken) impression that they roughly know what to expect, but since you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs, in the end, they’ll be forced to shoulder part of the cost. More to follow soon. The Two Deals of National Bank and EFG Luxembourg The National Bank is going through a period of great activity and the signs indicate that there are already advanced talks for specific projects. However, that doesn’t mean moves will happen on a journalist’s timeline. My column’s information about EFG Luxembourg of Spyros Latsis, which has been circulating in the market lately, is that National did indeed consider the scenario of acquiring it, but decided not to proceed. It was judged that while it would be a major move with substance for National – as it significantly strengthens and shifts balances in the field of private wealth management – it is a deal worth 4.5 billion. Since markets are currently highly volatile and in general we don’t know what tomorrow will bring, a deal of such scale carries significant risks for National. I think it’s a safer bet to expect – soon – some kind of agreement in the insurance sector and another deal in a different direction – most likely abroad. Strong first quarter for OPAP Analysts expect OPAP to announce yet another strong quarter the day after tomorrow (28/5), supported by betting revenue and the steady growth of its online operations. At the same time, revenue from online casinos will continue the excellent performance of recent quarters, while Joker’s strong results—offering the highest jackpot in its history—will also play an important role. AXIA forecasts total gross gaming revenue (GGR) at €584.9 million, up 6.4% year-on-year, EBITDA at €201.1 million (+5.7%), while net profit after minority interests is estimated at €119.6 million (+5.6%). Attention, however, is turning to the upcoming quarters, and AXIA sees challenges on the horizon. Last year’s second half benefited from Euro 2024 and positive betting results, so comparisons in the upcoming quarters are expected to be more demanding. Furthermore, due to the significant rise in the stock (which analysts had not anticipated), surpassing price targets, AXIA states that OPAP’s recommendation and valuation are under review, with an update expected soon. Ungrateful people…Sorras’ coffee maker up for auction? Give us a break Ah, where are the days of Artemis Sorras, who promised to erase Greece’s debt with the… shares of the unforgettable Bank of the East and his $650 billion. Unfortunately, we let that… opportunity go to waste and lost both Sorras and his bizarre business dealings from the spotlight. Those days are so far gone that, as the column has learned, an auction is scheduled for May 30, with the debtor being the (also unforgettable) “non-profit civil company ‘E.SY. – Hellenic Assembly’,” legally represented, with last known headquarters in the municipality of Perama, Attica, at 1 Makedonias Street, now with unknown address. For those with poor memory, this was the party through which Sorras decided to save us—since we refused to save ourselves. Yet, this ungrateful people showed no gratitude at the ballot box, and “Hellenic Assembly” ended up in the dustbin of history. In the meantime, though, it seems they left behind some debts despite the… billions of their leader. So, a private individual is putting the following items up for auction on the 30th: 2 aluminum metal ladders, 8 boxes of brochures, 1 portable radiator, 3 halogen heaters, 1 INOX induction unit, dimensions approx. 1.5×1.0x1.0m, 1 professional INOX counter, approx. 1.5×1.0x1.0m with three drawers, 1 professional INOX counter with 3 sinks and 2 overlapping cupboard doors, approx. 2.0×1.0x0.8m, 1 EUROCAL wall shelf, 1 MORRIS mini fridge, 1 SILVERCREST coffee maker, 2 two-seater sofas, 1 wooden coffee table with wheels, 1 plastic table with metal base, 1 square melamine table with metal base, 1 white desk, 2 drawer units with 3 drawers each, 1 VERO desktop tower, 1 TURBOX monitor, 1 TURBOX keyboard, 1 REACT amplifier, 1 white melamine shelving unit approx. 3.0×1.5×0.5m, 12 chairs with wooden back and gray leather seat, 1 white melamine shelving unit approx. 1.6×1.0x0.5m, 1 shelving unit approx. 1.6×1.0x0.5m with a double-door cupboard, 1 BRΧΑΝΤ A/C unit, 1 whiteboard approx. 1.2×1.0m, 2 white desks with 2 drawers each, 120x80cm, 1 old HP photocopier out of service, 1 HP screen, 1 IBM keyboard, 1 water cooler “NERA KRITIS”, 1 TELEFUNKEN monitor, 1 LG monitor, 1 PACKARD BELL monitor, 17 metal chairs with wood and leather seats, 8 square tables approx. 80x80cm with metal legs, 1 HP computer out of service, 1 small SAMSUNG XPRESS M2675F multifunction printer, 1 bookshelf with 3 shelves and various binders approx. 200x80x50cm, 1 bookshelf with 2 shelves and various binders approx. 160x60x40cm, 1 air conditioner of unknown brand with mirrored grey surface, 1 LG TV remote control, 1 LG air conditioner remote control, 1 YOKOHAMA air conditioner. As noted in the seizure report, “the described movables are old, of average quality, and some of them in poor condition.” Thus, they were all valued together at €500 and will be offered with a starting price of €300. It is further clarified that all this… clutter has been placed “under the custody and safekeeping of the enforcing creditor I. P., due to the difficulty of transporting them,” and remains with him in limbo. What can I add? All… faithful (if any are left), come forth. The talented Mr. Milionis Vasilis Milionis, known from the Energa–Hellas Power case, had active involvement in the energy project of “Larisa Thermoelectric S.A.,” which includes the construction of a natural gas power plant in Larisa, announced with fanfare last week. The investment, worth around €600 million, is being carried out by a consortium including Israeli-owned Clavenia Ltd (38.5%), DEPA Commercial (35%), which joined six months ago, Sirec Energy—a private equity firm via its subsidiary EUSIF Larissa (16.5%)—and Volton (10%). The plant, with a net capacity of 792 MW, is expected, pending the final investment decision, to begin construction in early 2026 and be operational by 2028. In this project, the talented Mr. Milionis is said to have played a key role in its development, as chairman of the board until mid-2021 and later as advisor. I remind you that Vasilis Milionis, who was initially sentenced to 10 years in prison but was acquitted on appeal in 2019, shook the nation 15 years ago with the energy scandal in which he was a central figure. It was then revealed that two private electricity companies (Energa – Hellas Power) were collecting the “property tax” included in electricity bills (EETIDE – predecessor to ENFIA) from customers but were not passing it on to the State—a case for which they were accused of embezzling over €230 million. In May 2021, Milionis was replaced by an Israeli executive at “Larisa Thermoelectric S.A.,” and since then he had disappeared from the energy map. Only to reappear in the medical cannabis business again with the Israelis of Tikun Olam Hellas, reportedly also having a shareholder link to the new Larisa project. Some involved in the project said last week that the Israelis removed him from the ambitious Larisa plan when they realized he was an unacceptable figure in the market and that his name carried a negative connotation. Still, whether Milionis is or isn’t part of the company behind the grand plans for an energy hub in Thessaly (natural gas plant, data center, etc.), I hear that he now shows strong interest in the defense sector. From energy to medical cannabis and now to defense ventures—if nothing else, Milionis seems to have a natural talent for spotting where the money flows! Decisions for 26 projects worth €2.5 billion in Healthcare This afternoon, the Governmental Committee for Projects of National Strategic Importance will convene and—according to information—assign 26 significant projects with a total budget of €2.5 billion to the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) and the Strategic Contracts Unit. The government is satisfied with the speed and quality of the projects implemented by the HCAP’s PPF unit in the health sector, which completed 92 renovated hospitals and 160 Health Centers within timelines and budgets. The stock exchange worries only because of its own success By just a tenth of a percentage point (0.10%), the General Index on the Athens Stock Exchange missed the chance to post its 6th consecutive positive week—thanks to Trump and his tariff announcements. Today, with both the London and New York markets closed, the Athens market will move guided solely by the short-term needs of institutional investors, who see the General Index up by +22.64% year-to-date, the Banking Index by +35.63%, and the FTSE25 by +25.57%. The major event of the week comes tomorrow with the annual MSCI review of stock market classifications, with the key question being whether the Greek market will be included in the watchlist for potential reclassification into the Developed Markets category. Inclusion of the Athens Stock Exchange in the watchlist is considered pivotal for fund managers and investment funds active in both Emerging and Developed Markets. News is also expected from Cyprus, not only regarding the large dividend (€0.48/share) from the Bank of Cyprus but also announcements about the future of its shareholder structure. The PotUS’s crafty moves The U.S. President carefully chose the day to announce his ideas about imposing a 50% tax on European products (starting June 1) and at least a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but manufactured abroad. As mentioned, Wall Street is closed today, Monday, for Memorial Day. This was the first time President Trump directly targeted specific companies with tariffs, later stating he would also impose 25% tariffs on Samsung products if not made in the U.S. Americans will have ample time to decide whether Trump is bluffing once again. Market speculators, however, had yet another opportunity to “play” with Trump’s statements. The Dow Jones dropped 256 points (-0.6%). The S&P 500 fell -0.7%. The Nasdaq -1%. All three indices recorded their worst week since April. It’s worth remembering that Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many others, made large donations to Trump’s Inaugural Fund and attended the Washington event, seated near Meta Platforms’ Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Chairman Jeff Bezos when the colossal $500 billion tech investment plan was unveiled at the end of February. Markets have largely stopped debating the truth of the PotUS’s claims or the real impact of his threats on the growth prospects of the world’s largest economy. What they cannot ignore, however, is the impact they are likely to have on corporate earnings—whether that’s Apple or the countless U.S. companies that rely on overseas sales to generate profits. They’re building nuclear batteries for the Moon and Mars Zeno Power Systems has just raised $50 million to build nuclear batteries that work where regular batteries can’t: in the depths of the oceans, the Arctic, in space, and even on the Moon. Zeno Power’s technology uses the decay of radioactive material to generate energy—no sunlight or power outlets required. The company has already signed major contracts with NASA and the U.S. military and secured fuel from the Department of Energy. They’ve added a former Navy chief to their board of directors. The future of energy might not be solar—it might be nuclear, silent, and built for the coldest, darkest places, not just on planet Earth. Explore related questions

Title: Secretive Hedge Fund Run by Ex-JPMorgan Chase Trader Bringing In 51% Average Returns: Report
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/05/26/secretive-hedge-fund-run-by-ex-jpmorgan-chase-trader-bringing-in-51-average-returns-report/
Time Published: 2025-05-26T11:45:12Z
Full Content:
An ex-JPMorgan analyst has reportedly set up a mysterious hedge fund in Taiwan that has so far recorded massive return rates. Former JPM Asset Management analyst Andre Liu has quietly created a proprietary trading firm powerhouse in Taipei that has far outshone the rest of the industry, reports Bloomberg. According to the firm’s internal documents seen by Bloomberg, UC Capital has recorded an internal rate of return of 51% since it was launched in 2021. A report from research and insights firm PivotalPath found that in 2024, hedge funds scored an average return of 10.7%. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that hedge fund giant Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund saw a 15.1% return that year while Millennium Management saw 15%. Bridgewater Associates, which is widely regarded as the largest hedge fund in the world, posted 11% in gains for its flagship Pure Alpha 18% volatility fund. Bloomberg’s data also shows that UC Capital has routinely beaten the local market in Taiwan (TAIEX), even recording significant gains in 2022 despite the Taiwan stock market index ending the year in the negative. UC Capital turned heads in Q4 of last year when it successfully purchased the ball that baseball star Shohei Ohtani hit his 50th home run on the same season he also stole 50 bases – a legendary feat in the MLB. According to Bloomberg, Liu started UC with a colleague in 2013, and by 2021, the firm’s assets exploded 27,000% before the trader decided to start his own company. Says Liu, “Ever since I was a kid, I believed that the heart of trading lies in the changes in moods and sentiment.” Consequently, UC’s engineers have built a model to measure public discourse by scraping and analyzing social media, online forums, news articles and comment sections, in what the firm describes as “sentiment thermometers” to track certain trending topics and behavior. Leveraging its sentiment-driven approach, UC capitalized on a decline in TSMC’s share price earlier this year after its models detected a surge in public discourse involving President Trump and the company’s future. At the time, the chipmaker announced a $100 billion investment in its US plants. UC also reportedly bought an earthquake detector on the eastern coast of Taiwan so that the firm would know about earthquakes before anyone else could in order to short markets in case of uncertainty. The trading firm currently has about $497 million in liquid assets before leverage.

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/best-investments-ever-average-americans-stock-market-real-estate-wealth-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-26T09:55:01Z
Full Content:
You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since. His investments have grown to roughly $43,000 and $167,000 since the initial buy-in, respectively. Brinkman, who works at a production company that creates images of cars, got the idea to invest in Tesla when he began seeing more Tesla vehicles in the showroom at his job. Similarly, Brinkman liked Apple computers in the early 2000s and decided to invest in the company when he had enough disposable income. Nowadays, Brinkman has taken a less risky approach to investing and regularly buys index funds every two weeks. Jiang, a former Google employee who now runs the personal finance platform Peek, enjoys investing in tech because it's an industry she's well-versed in. Jiang bought into Tesla in 2015 after hearing her boss and many others bragging about owning one. She had seen a rise in electric vehicle popularity, but consumers' brand association with Tesla made it stand out to her. "I was like, 'this is a category-defining company and I want to buy in,'" Jiang said. She grew her investment by 1,200%. She recently exited her position in the company, as she had achieved a substantial return and didn't like the volatility associated with CEO Elon Musk. More recently, Jiang has bet big on Palantir (PLTR). She's been following the company since before it became public and believes the company has an edge thanks to its sticky government customers and innovations in AI. Jiang jumped in last year and snatched up the stock at just $23 a share. Since then, the stock has taken off, and Jiang's investment is up roughly 420%. Jiang has no plans to sell her Palantir stock anytime soon: "My conviction is that it'll be as big as an Nvidia," she said. For 10 years before becoming a software engineer, Nassif was a full-time online poker player. It was common to be paid in bitcoin, which Nassif would then convert into cash to pay for living expenses. Over the years, Nassif has inadvertently collected 0.8 bitcoin through this process — a hefty position as bitcoin hits an all-time high. Earlier in his poker career, up to 50% of his net worth was tied up in the cryptocurrency, but Nassif felt that was too high of a risk to be sustainable, so he started selling down to his current position. Another one of his big wins was starting to purchase Nvidia stock 15 years ago. He now holds 342 shares with an over 3,000% gain. Nassif was influenced by his heavy bitcoin exposure, as he realized Nvidia's GPUs were in high demand for crypto mining. Similar to bitcoin, Nassif has also been gradually taking profits in the wake of the AI hype, as he doesn't want to have a large portion of his portfolio tied up in a single stock. Nassif no longer makes any big bets on individual stocks. "In the last few years, I've been incredibly boring," Nassif said. "It's just been index funds." For the past eight years, White has divided his money between 60% index funds and 40% individual stocks. When picking individual stocks, White considers himself a value investor and looks for companies at cheap entry points. White is a particularly big fan of "convenience-oriented" stocks that make life easier for consumers, and Netflix (NFLX) was a bet that paid off big for him. In early 2022, Netflix stock plunged by two-thirds after the company reported losing subscribers and threatened to crack down on password sharing. White bought 45 shares in the company for a cost basis of $244 per share. Today, the stock is nearing $1,200, and White's investment has yielded around a 380% return. "It was a very sound investment, very well-managed, very mature leadership team. So when public sentiment pushed the stock down, I believed that was an irrational action, and I decided to jump in and start a position," White said. Waresmith has been investing in real estate for over 10 years. She bought her first house, a single-family home in Tampa, in 2013 from savings she accumulated working as an aerial acrobat on a cruise ship. Looking back, Waresmith's favorite real estate investment has been multi-family homes. She refinanced her property in Tampa and pulled out cash to buy a duplex in Massachusetts in 2020, securing a mortgage rate of 3.2%. Waresmith then house-hacked by living in one unit on the property and renting out the other. The mortgage at the time was around $2,300, and she rented out the other unit for $1,700, almost covering the monthly payment. "I think house hacking is one of the single smartest financial decisions anyone can make, as long as you choose the right property," Waresmith said. "I would not have felt comfortable affording the mortgage on that house alone at the time." Because her living expenses were so low from house hacking. Waresmith was able to invest and purchase another multi-family home in 2022. After moving out of the duplex, Waresmith now rents out both sides of the house, and her rental income is enough to easily cover the mortgage, as the rent on one side is now $2,500. Brennan Schlagbaum typically likes to invest in ETFs, but the one time he bought an individual stock, he struck it big. "I focus on index funds primarily, but there are some obvious opportunities from time to time, and one of those was Meta," Schlagbaum said. He owns 36 shares of the company, which is his only single-stock investment. In 2022, Meta Platforms (META) dropped from above $300 to under $90 after a series of weak earnings and a broader tech sell-off. Despite the negative sentiment, Schlagbaum, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, felt like the company was in a good position according to its financial statements. "They have great free cash flow, hardly any debt, tons of reinvestment," Schlagbaum said. He bought the stock in October 2022 at $97. The stock is now at $628 as of May 23, yielding a gain of almost 550%. Last year, Mark and his husband were looking to move to Chicago from Salt Lake City. It just so happened that another couple they knew was also looking to move there — and so the four of them decided to team up and buy a house together. Mark and his husband sold their Salt Lake City house, which they had bought right before the pandemic housing boom, in June 2024. The two couples ended up purchasing a multi-family home last July for around $800,000. They decided to put down 40% for their down payment instead of the traditional 20%, as they wanted to minimize their monthly mortgage payments amid the current interest rate environment. For Mark, the proceeds from selling his Salt Lake City house covered the down payment. The house has four floors and is set up as two apartments stacked on top of each other, and comes with six bedrooms and four kitchens. Mark and his co-owners are very pleased with the living arrangement, as it's helped them get much more bang for their buck. "With what we are each paying, we never could have found something similar separately, even if each couple had something half the size of this house," Mark said. Forsythe was scrolling through r/WallStreetBets in 2022 when a ticker caught his eye: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), a satellite communications company pioneering a space-based cellular broadband network. The stock has a niche cult following on X dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Forsythe started with an initial holding of 2,500 shares at $10. From 2022 to 2024, the stock price plunged to under $2, and Forsythe actually sold his shares at a loss when the stock hit $2.15. But shortly after, in a classic WSB YOLO fashion, Forsythe bought back in with 35,000 shares at $2.88 per share. "My thinking was, considering the due diligence and following the stock for two years, I would feel terrible giving up on it now, especially if it rebounded," Forsythe said of buying back in. Forsythe's bet paid off — after buying back in, the company announced partnerships with AT&T and Verizon, sending the share price soaring. His investment sits at around $900,000 today. Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."

Title: We asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investment of their lives

You don't have to be a Wall Street strategist or top fund manager to make your money work. Business Insider asked 10 everyday Americans for the best investments they've made. Some stumbled into gains by serendipitously buying Magnificent Seven stocks before they took off. Others leaned into real estate or alternative investments. And yes, some struck it big on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets finds. All of this goes to show that there's no single path to investing success. With their investments, these Americans have achieved various wealth-building milestones, including financial independence, early retirement, and an increased sense of security with their money. Business Insider has verified all investments. Here's how they did it. Vanscoy, a full-time dad who manages his family's portfolios, isn't one to invest in flashy tech stocks. He describes his strategy as "conservative and focused on dividend growth." Vanscoy's investment in Nvidia (NVDA) wasn't part of his usual portfolio management plan. Right before the pandemic, Vanscoy came across news articles and posts on forums about new video game developments. "I asked my kids what was going on, and they said these Nvidia graphics cards are really popular and everyone's trying to get them. I did a little research, and I thought that might be a fun pick-and-shovel play," Vanscoy told Business Insider. Vanscoy bought 80 shares of Nvidia in March 2020 for a total of $21,641.60. He's since taken profits twice, once in 2021 and again in 2023, which paid for his initial investment. Now, he holds 1,292 shares with a cost basis of $6.76 per share — a $151,000 position with an over 1,500% gain. Fischer, a former data analyst turned finance content creator, bought a house with her now-husband before they got married in 2020. It seemed a little risky at the time but has since paid off majorly. "At the time, interest rates were around 3%, and buying made just as much financial sense as renting after the initial down payment," Fischer said. "It also gave us the chance to test living together before marriage and see what an integrated life looks like. If worst comes to worst and things didn't work out, we would just sell and split the equity in half," Fischer added. The couple purchased their house for a little under half a million after the down payment. They refinanced their 3.3% mortgage rate down to 2.99% in 2021, right before mortgage rates shot up to 7%. Now, their monthly mortgage is $2,487 — which is comparable to local rent for a similar unit in the Seattle area. Buying a house and locking down a low mortgage rate means Fischer doesn't have to worry about rising rents. "We're just incredibly grateful we were able to purchase our home when we did," Fischer said. Brinkman grew up helping his grandfather manage his personal accounts, which imbued him with a strong sense of financial responsibility. "When I was in my 20s, I moved to LA and was very tight on money," Brinkman said. "I had very little to live off of at the time, but I still prioritized investing." Between 2012 and 2013, Brinkman bought $4,000 of Apple (AAPL) and $5,000 of Tesla (TSLA), which he's held ever since.

Even factoring in his initial loss on the first 2,500 shares, that's still a hefty 650% gain on his total invested capital. "I don't plan on selling anything," Forsythe said. "I've diamond-handed it all the way from the ups and downs."

Title: What Analysts Think of Costco Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-costco-stock-ahead-of-earnings-11740169
Time Published: 2025-05-26T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Costco Wholesale (COST) is set to report its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts generally bearing bullish ratings on the stock but not expecting substantial share-price gains. Ten analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rate the stock as a "buy," while the other six call the warehouse retail giant a "hold." The average price target is at $1,058.40, suggesting upside of about 5% from Thursday's intraday level at $1,010.37, and just short of the stock's record close slightly under $1,077 on Feb. 13. Costco is expected to report an 8% increase in total revenue from the same time a year ago to $63.19 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 13% to $4.27. The retailer is expected to report 79.6 million paying members, up from 78.4 million last quarter. UBS analysts said last week that they see Costco as well-positioned to "navigate the uncertain macro backdrop better than the vast majority of retail," as it can quickly stop selling a product it may no longer be able to sell at an appealing price, and replace it with another. Executives have said Costco should be see the benefits of its membership fee increase, which took effect at the turn of its fiscal year in September, start to positively impact its profit in the second half of its fiscal 2025, and into fiscal 2026. The analysts said that high-margin membership revenue should give Costco more room to absorb the impact of tariffs without raising prices. "There’s probably not a lot that can come from this print that will change the market’s perception that [Costco] is a good place to be," UBS analysts wrote. "Though, its superior position, levers, and capabilities to manage the upcoming headwinds will probably be more evident as the impact of tariffs become translucent in the coming months." Costco shares, which have had an up-and-down year, have added about 10% in 2025 so far.

Title: Iris Recognition
URL: https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Iris+recognition
Time Published: 2025-05-26T04:24:32Z
Full Content:
Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of the irides of an individual's eyes, whose complex random patterns are unique and can be seen from some distance. Not to be confused with another, less prevalent, ocular-based technology, retina scanning, iris recognition uses camera technology with subtle infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual.[1] Databases of enrolled templates are searched by matcher engines at speeds measured in the millions of templates per second per (single-core) CPU, and with infinitesimally small false match rates. Many millions of persons in several countries around the world have been enrolled in iris recognition systems, for convenience purposes such as passport-free automated border-crossings, and some national ID systems based on this technology are being deployed. A key advantage of iris recognition, besides its speed of matching and its extreme resistance to false matches, is the stability of the iris as an internal, protected, yet externally visible organ of the eye. In 1987, two ophthalmology professors, Leonard Flom of New York University and Aran Safir of the University of Connecticut, were issued a first of its kind, broad patent # 4,641,349 entitled "Iris Recognition Technology".[2] Subsequently, John Daugman of Harvard University was then salaried by both ophthalmologists to write the algorithm for their concept based upon an extensive series of high resolution iris photos supplied to him by Flom from his volunteer private patients.[3] Several years later, Daugman received a method patent for the algorithm and a crudely constructed prototype proved the concept. The three individuals then founded "IriScan" (which later became "Iridian Technologies, Inc.") and assigned the Flom/Safir patent to that entity. "IriScan" then licensed several corporations to the exclusive Daugman algorithm under the protection of the Flom/Safir broad umbrella patent listed above; thus, preventing other algorithms from competing. Upon expiration of the Flom/Safir patent in 2008 other algorithms were patented and several were found to be superior to Daugman's and are now being funded by U.S. Government agencies.[4] Most iris recognition systems acquire images of the iris in the visible wavelength (400 - 700 nm) or near infrared range (700 - 900 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each wavelength distinguishes different features of the iris with NIR and VW obtaining Information from the iris by its texture and pigmentation, respectively. The majority of iris recognition systems operate within the longer NIR spectrum which can penetrate dark-coloured irides, the dominant phenotype of the human population, revealing texture not easily observed in the VW spectrum. The NIR spectrum also reduces iris pattern contamination by blocking ambient corneal reflections. Although reducing reflections through NIR makes system recognitions robust, NIR imaging cannot distinguish the effects of melanin, the primary colouring component in irides. The melanin, also known as chromophore, mainly consists of two distinct heterogeneous macromolecules, called eumelanin (brown–black) and pheomelanin (yellow–reddish),[5][6] whose absorbance at longer wavelengths in the NIR spectrum is negligible. At shorter wavelengths within the VW spectrum, however, these chromophores are excited and provide rich sources of information mainly coded as shape patterns in iris. Hosseini, et al.[7] provide a comparison between these two imaging modalities and fused the results to boost the recognition rate. An alternative feature extraction method to encode VW iris images was also introduced, which is highly robust to reflectivity terms in iris. Such fusion results are seemed to be alternative approach for multi-modal biometric systems which intend to reach high accuracies of recognition in large databanks. An iris-recognition algorithm first has to localize the inner and outer boundaries of the iris (pupil and limbus) in an image of an eye. Further subroutines detect and exclude eyelids, eyelashes, and specular reflections that often occlude parts of the iris. The set of pixels containing only the iris, normalized by a rubber-sheet model to compensate for pupil dilation or constriction, is then analyzed to extract a bit pattern encoding the information needed to compare two iris images. In the case of Daugman's algorithms, a Gabor wavelet transform is used. The result is a set of complex numbers that carry local amplitude and phase information about the iris pattern. In Daugman's algorithms, most amplitude information is discarded, and the 2048 bits representing an iris pattern consist of phase information (complex sign bits of the Gabor wavelet projections). Discarding the amplitude information ensures that the template remains largely unaffected by changes in illumination or camera gain (contrast), and contributes to the long-term usability of the biometric template. For identification (one-to-many template matching) or verification (one-to-one template matching), a template created by imaging an iris is compared to stored template(s) in a database. If the Hamming distance is below the decision threshold, a positive identification has effectively been made because of the statistical extreme improbability that two different persons could agree by chance ("collide") in so many bits, given the high entropy of iris templates. The iris of the eye has been described as the ideal part of the human body for biometric identification for several reasons: It is an internal organ that is well protected against damage and wear by a highly transparent and sensitive membrane (the cornea). This distinguishes it from fingerprints, which can be difficult to recognize after years of certain types of manual labor. The iris is mostly flat, and its geometric configuration is only controlled by two complementary muscles (the sphincter pupillae and dilator pupillae) that control the diameter of the pupil. This makes the iris shape far more predictable than, for instance, that of the face. The iris has a fine texture that—like fingerprints—is determined randomly during embryonic gestation. Like the fingerprint, it is very hard (if not impossible) to prove that the iris is unique. However, there are so many factors that go into the formation of these textures (the iris and fingerprint) that the chance of false matches for either is extremely low. Even genetically identical individuals have completely independent iris textures. An iris scan is similar to taking a photograph and can be performed from about 10 cm to a few meters away. There is no need for the person being identified to touch any equipment that has recently been touched by a stranger, thereby eliminating an objection that has been raised in some cultures against fingerprint scanners, where a finger has to touch a surface, or retinal scanning, where the eye must be brought very close to an eyepiece (like looking into a microscope).[8] The commercially deployed iris-recognition algorithm, John Daugman's IrisCode, has an unprecedented false match rate (better than 10−11 if a Hamming distance threshold of 0.26 is used, meaning that up to 26% of the bits in two IrisCodes are allowed to disagree due to imaging noise, reflections, etc., while still declaring them to be a match).[9] While there are some medical and surgical procedures that can affect the colour and overall shape of the iris, the fine texture remains remarkably stable over many decades. Some iris identifications have succeeded over a period of about 30 years. Many commercial iris scanners can be easily fooled by a high quality image of an iris or face in place of the real thing. The scanners are often tough to adjust and can become bothersome for multiple people of different heights to use in succession. The accuracy of scanners can be affected by changes in lighting. Iris scanners are significantly more expensive than some other forms of biometrics, password or prox card security systems Iris scanning is a relatively new technology and is incompatible with the very substantial investment that the law enforcement and immigration authorities of some countries have already made into fingerprint recognition. Iris recognition is very difficult to perform at a distance larger than a few meters and if the person to be identified is not cooperating by holding the head still and looking into the camera. However, several academic institutions and biometric vendors are developing products that claim to be able to identify subjects at distances of up to 10 meters ("Standoff Iris" or "Iris at a Distance" as well as SRI International's "Iris on the Move" for persons walking at speeds up to 1 meter/sec).[8][10] As with other photographic biometric technologies, iris recognition is susceptible to poor image quality, with associated failure to enroll rates. As with other identification infrastructure (national residents databases, ID cards, etc.), civil rights activists have voiced concerns that iris-recognition technology might help governments to track individuals beyond their will. Researchers have tricked iris scanners using images generated from digital codes of stored irises. Criminals could exploit this flaw to steal the identities of others.[11] Alcohol consumption causes recognition degradation as the pupil dilates/constricts causing deformation in the iris pattern.[12] As with most other biometric identification technology, a still not satisfactorily solved problem with iris recognition is the problem of live-tissue verification. The reliability of any biometric identification depends on ensuring that the signal acquired and compared has actually been recorded from a live body part of the person to be identified and is not a manufactured template. Many commercially available iris-recognition systems are easily fooled by presenting a high-quality photograph of a face instead of a real face, which makes such devices unsuitable for unsupervised applications, such as door access-control systems. The problem of live-tissue verification is less of a concern in supervised applications (e.g., immigration control), where a human operator supervises the process of taking the picture. Methods that have been suggested to provide some defence against the use of fake eyes and irises include changing ambient lighting during the identification (switching on a bright lamp), such that the pupillary reflex can be verified and the iris image be recorded at several different pupil diameters; analysing the 2D spatial frequency spectrum of the iris image for the peaks caused by the printer dither patterns found on commercially available fake-iris contact lenses; analysing the temporal frequency spectrum of the image for the peaks caused by computer displays. Other methods include using spectral analysis instead of merely monochromatic cameras to distinguish iris tissue from other material; observing the characteristic natural movement of an eyeball (measuring nystagmus, tracking eye while text is read, etc.); testing for retinal retroreflection (red-eye effect) or for reflections from the eye's four optical surfaces (front and back of both cornea and lens) to verify their presence, position and shape. Another proposed method is to use 3D imaging (e.g., stereo cameras) to verify the position and shape of the iris relative to other eye features. A 2004 report by the German Federal Office for Information Security noted that none of the iris-recognition systems commercially available at the time implemented any live-tissue verification technology. Like any pattern-recognition technology, live-tissue verifiers will have their own false-reject probability and will therefore further reduce the overall probability that a legitimate user is accepted by the sensor.

Title: Trump's Middle East AI Deal: "Just Count the Server Racks"
URL: https://www.chinatalk.media/p/about-that-ai-middle-east-deal
Time Published: 2025-05-25T14:03:59Z
Full Content:
Zvi Mowshowitz of the Don't Worry About the Vase substack did an excellent job writing up the key dynamics of the deal. I’ll be running excerpts from his post with some comments of mine interspersed. Our government, having withdrawn the new diffusion rules, has now announced an agreement to sell massive numbers of highly advanced AI chips to UAE and Saudi Arabia (KSA). This post analyzes that deal and that decision. It is possible, given sufficiently strong agreement details (which are not yet public and may not be finalized) and private unvoiced considerations, that this deal contains sufficient safeguards and justifications that, absent ability to fix other American policy failures, this decision is superior to the available alternatives. Perhaps these are good deals, with sufficiently strong security arrangements that will actually stick. Perhaps UAE and KSA are more important markets and general partners than we realize, and the rest of the world really is unable to deploy capital and electrical power the way they can and there is nothing we can do to change this, and perhaps they have other points of strategic importance, so we have to deal with them. Perhaps they are reliable American allies going forward who wouldn’t use this as leverage, for reasons I do not understand. There are potential worlds where this makes sense. The fact remains that the case being made for this deal, in public, actively makes the situation seem worse. David Sacks in particular is doubling down and extending the rhetoric I pushed back against last week, when I targeted Obvious Nonsense in AI diffusion discourse. Even within the White House, the China hawks are questioning this deal, and Sacks responded by claiming to not even understand their objections and to all but accuse such people of being traitorous decels wearing trench coats. I stand by my statements last week that even if accept the premise that all we need care about are ‘America wins the AI race’ and how we must ‘beat China,’ our government’s policies, on diffusion and elsewhere, seem determined to lose an AI race against China. The point of the diffusion rules is to keep the AI chips secure and out of Chinese hands, both in terms of physical security and use of their compute via remote access. It is possible that the agreements we are making with UAE and KSA will replace and improve upon the functionality, in those countries in particular, of the diffusion rules. It’s not about a particular set of rules. It is about the effect of those rules. Give me a better way to get the same effect, and I’m happy to take it. When I say ‘something similar’ below, I mean in the sense of sufficient safeguards against the diversion of either the physical AI chips or the compute from the AI chips. Access to those chips is what matters most. Whereas market share in selling AI chips is not something I am inclined to worry about except in my role as Nvidia shareholder. I do not consider them reliable allies going forward, and there are various reasons that even the best version of these agreements would make me deeply uncomfortable, but it is possible to reach an agreement that physically locates many data centers in the Middle East and lets them reap the financial benefits of their investments and have compute available for local use, but does not in the most meaningful senses ‘hand them’ the compute in question. As in, no I do not trust them, but we could find a way that we do not have to, if they were fully open to whatever it took to make that happen. I also would highlight the implicit claim I made here, that the pool of American advanced AI chips is essentially fixed, and that we have sufficient funding available in Big Tech to buy all of them indefinitely. If that is not true, then the UAE/KSA money matters a lot more. Then there is the similar question of whether we were going to actually run out of available electrical power with no way to get around that. A lot of the question comes down to: What would have counterfactually happened to those chips? Would we have been unable to deploy them? [Jordan: See ChinaTalk’s recent coverage of an excellent IFP report that explored what a policy agenda to rapidly increase the energy available for AI deployment would look like] Despite leading the world in AI innovation, there’s no guarantee that America will rise to meet the challenge of AI infrastructure. Specifically, the key technological barrier for data center construction within the next 5 years is new power capacity With that in mind, here are the central points I highlighted last week: America is ahead of China in AI. Diffusion rules serve to protect America’s technological lead where it matters. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not reliable American allies, nor are they important markets for our technology. We should not be handing them large shares of the world’s most valuable resource, compute. The exact diffusion rule is gone but something similar must take its place, to do otherwise would be how America ‘loses the AI race.’ Not having any meaningful regulations at all on AI, or ‘building machines that are smarter and more capable than humans,’ is not a good idea, nor would it mean America would ‘lose the AI race.’ AI is currently virtually unregulated as a distinct entity, so ‘repeal 10 regulations for every one you add’ is to not regulate at all building machines that are soon likely to be smarter and more capable than humans, or anything else either. ‘Winning the AI race’ is about racing to superintelligence. It is not about who gets to build the GPU. The reason to ‘win’ the ‘race’ is not market share in selling big tech solutions. It is especially not about who gets to sell others the AI chips. If we care about American dominance in global markets, including tech markets, stop talking about how what we need to do is not regulate AI, and start talking about the things that will actually help us, or at least stop doing the things that actively hurt us and could actually make us lose. Diffusion controls on AI chips we’ve enforced on China so far have had a huge impact. DeepSeek put out a highly impressive AI model, but by their own statements they were severely handicapped by lack of compute. Chinese adoption of AI is also greatly held back by lack of inference compute. China is competing in spite of this severe disadvantage. It is vital that we hold their feet to the fire on this. China has an acute chip shortage, because it physically cannot make more AI chips, so any chips it would ship to a place like UAE or KSA would each be one less chip available in China. Whenever you see arguments from David Sacks and others against AI diffusion rules, ask the question: Is an argument for a different set of export controls and a different chip regime that still protects against China getting large quantities of advanced AI chips? Or is it an argument, as it often is, that to preserve our edge in compute we should sell off our compute, that to preserve our edge in tech we should give away our edge in tech? As in, that what matters is our market share of AI chips, not who uses them? This is not a strawman, for example Ben Thompson argues exactly this very explicitly and repeatedly. Ben Thompson’s recent interview with Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, made it clear both of them have this exact position. That to maintain America’s edge in AI, we need to sell our AI chips to whoever wants them, including China, because ‘China will not be held back’ as if having a lot more chips wouldn’t have helped them. And essentially saying that all Nvidia chips everywhere support the ‘American tech stack’ rather than China rather obviously turning around and using them for their own tech. He explicitly is yelling we need to ‘compete in China’ or else. Complete Obvious Nonsense talking of his own book, which one must remind oneself is indeed his job, what were you really expecting him to say? Well, what he is saying is that the way we ‘lose the AI race’ is someone builds a CUDA alternative or steals Nvidia market share. That his market is what matters. It’s full text. Not remotely a strawman. I would disagree with arguments of form #2 in the strongest possible terms. If it’s arguments of form #1, we can talk about it. We should keep these facts in mind as we analyze the fact that the United States has signed a preliminary chip deal with the UAE. There is a 5GW AUE-US AI campus planned, and is taking similar action in Saudi Arabia. The deals were negotiated by a team led by David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan. Lennart Heim: To put the new 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi (UAE) into perspective. It would support up to 2.5 million NVIDIA B200s. That's bigger than all other major AI infrastructure announcements we've seen so far. In exchange for access to our chips, we get what are claimed to be strong protections against chip diversion, and promises of what I understand to be a total of $200 billion in investments by the UAE. That dollar figure is counting things like aluminum, petroleum, airplanes, Qualcomm and so on. It is unclear how much of that is new. The part of the deal that matters is that a majority of the UAE investment in data centers has to happen here in America. I notice that I am skeptical that all the huge numbers cited in the various investment ‘deals’ we keep making will end up as actual on-the-ground investments. As in: Walter Bloomberg: UAE PRESIDENT SAYS UAE TO INVEST $1.4T IN U.S OVER NEXT 10 YEARS At best there presumably is some creative accounting and political symbolism involved in such statements. Current UAE foreign-direct-investment stock in the USA is only $38 billion, their combined wealth funds only have $1.9 trillion total. We can at best treat $1.4 trillion as an aspiration, an upper bound scenario. If we get the $200 billion we should consider that a win, although if the deal is effectively ‘all your investments broadly are in the West and not in China’ then that would indeed be a substantial amount of funds. Nor is this an isolated incident. The Administration is constantly harping huge numbers, claiming to have brought in $14 trillion in new investment, including $4 trillion from the recent trip to Arabia, or roughly half of America’s GDP. Jason Furman (top economic advisor, Obama White House): That’s nuts and baseless. I doubt the press releases even add up to that. But, regardless, press releases are a terrible way to determine the investment or the impact of his policies on it. Justin Wolfers: Trump has claimed a $1.2 trillion investment deal from Qatar. Qatar’s annual GDP is a bit less than $250 billion per year. So he’s claiming an investment that would require every dollar every Qatari earned over the next five years. UAE’s MGX will also be opening Europe’s largest data center in France, together with Nvidia, an 8.5 billion Euro investment, first phase to be operational in 2028. This has been in the works for a while. Not that the numbers ultimately matter all that much. What does matter is: How will we ensure the chips don’t fall literally or functionally into Chinese hands? It comes down to the security provisions and who is going to effectively have access to and run all this compute. I don’t see here any laying out of the supposed tough security provisions. Without going into details, if the agreements on both physical and digital security are indeed implemented in a way that is sufficiently tough and robust, if we are the ones who both physically and digitally control and monitor things on a level at least as high as domestically, and can actually have confidence none of this will get diverted, then that goes a long way. We don’t yet have enough of that information to say. The public explanations for the deal, and the public statements about what safety precautions are considered necessary, do not bring comfort. I very much do not like comments like this, made in response to the Bloomberg piece above. David Sacks (US AI Czar): If the concern [about the deal] is about diversion of advanced semiconductors to China, that’s an important policy objective but one that is easily addressed with a security agreement and a “trust but verify” approach. Modern AI supercomputers are 8 feet tall and weigh two tons; these are not like diamonds smuggled in a briefcase. To verify that chips are where they’re supposed to be, an auditor can just visit the data center and count server racks. Semianalysis: As such, physical inspections are key to ensuring the GPUs are where they are supposed to be. The White House is aware of the risks and is prepared to ensure the chips are where they are supposed to be. As Bloomberg reported (quotes David Sacks’s statement above). I’m sorry, what? You can ‘just visit the data center and count server racks’? It terrifies me to see so many people arguing for the deal explicitly saying that this is a good statement, rather than a terrifying statement that we are hoping no one involved in the actual work believes to be true. [Jordan: In 2022 I did a show with Kevin Wolf, the former head of BIS, who mentioned off-hand that there were literally only two people Commerce had in China to do site inspections. Since then BIS’ budget has barely budged and faced DOGE cuts in the early days of this administration. There is not the capacity to do datacenter inspections in a serious way today.] Jordan Schneider: Let's start with the last thing first. This 60-day unverified list: is there a potential that the impact of this could actually be a lot bigger than what we currently see, if some of these big names on the unverified entity list end up graduating to full entity-list status? Kevin Wolf: It's really up to the Chinese government. If they allow access, give the information that the Commerce Department is seeking, and allow the two people in China that do inspections and site visits to do their jobs… Jordan Schneider: Whoa, wait, two? There are, like, 30 firms on there! Kevin Wolf: Yeah, I know, but no other country has any, and the Commerce Department is the only export control organization on the planet with its own enforcement agents who are subject matter experts in export controls. I think diversion via remote access is far more likely than physical diversion, and this response does not address the remote access issue at all, but even simply treating this as a physical diversion issue, o3, is the quoted statement accurate? o3 (full one shot, full response quoted, in response to literally quoting Sacks without attribution and asking ‘is this accurate?’): Short version: Mostly wrong. Chips are tiny and high-value, so diversion is hard to stop with “count the racks.” Physical audits help but they are far from sufficient. High value-to-weight ratio.At ~$30 k per H100, a single 20 kg carry-on full of GPUs is > $1 m. That’s an attractive target. Racks are heavy; the payload isn’t. Modularity.GPUs slide out in minutes. An auditor sees the enclosure; they cannot tell if the trays were swapped yesterday or will be tomorrow. Dummy blanks cost <$10. Front companies & trans-shipping.Chips often leave the compliant data-center before any inspection window. Paperwork shows them installed; reality changes after the auditor flies home. Remote lease risk.Even if the hardware stays in the U.S., Chinese entities can simply rent time on it. Export-control rules treat “deemed exports” (remote access by restricted users) as violations. Limited audit frequency & competence.Meaningful verification requires random, intrusive, technically savvy inspections plus cryptographic attestation of firmware. Counting racks is neither. My best estimate: ≤ 30 % that “security agreement + occasional rack counting” alone keeps advanced GPUs out of China for > 3 years. ≥ 70 % that significant leakage continues absent tighter controls (HW tracking, cryptographic attestation, and supply-chain tagging). So the quoted claim is misleading: rack-level audits are helpful but nowhere near “easily addresses” the diversion problem. When I asked how many chips would likely be diverted from a G42 data center if this was the security regime, o3’s 90% confidence interval was 5%-50%. Note that the G42 data center is 20% of the total compute here, so if we generously assume no physical diversion risk in the other 80%, that’s 1%-10% of all compute we deploy in the UAE. Is that acceptable? The optimal amount of chip diversion is not zero. But I think this level of diversion would be a big deal, and the bigger concern is remote access. I want to presume, for overdetermined reasons, that Sacks’s statement was written without due consideration or it does not reflect his actual views, and we would not actually make this level of dumb mistake where they could literally just swap the chips out for dummy chips. I presume we are planning to use vastly superior and more effective precautions against chip diversion and also have a plan for robust monitoring of compute use to prevent remote access diversion. But how can we trust an administration to take such issues seriously, if their AI Czar is not taking this even a little bit seriously? This is not a one time incident. Similar statements keep coming. That’s why I spent a whole post responding to them. David Sacks is also quoted extensively directly in the Bloomberg piece, and is repeatedly very dismissive of worried about diversion of chips or of compute, saying it is a fake argument and an easy problem to solve, and he talks about these as if they were reliable American allies in ways I do not believe are accurate. Sacks also continues to appear to view winning AI to be largely about selling AI chips. As in, if G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI firm, is using American AI chips, then it essentially ‘counts as American’ for purposes of ‘winning,’ or similar. I don’t think that is how this works, or that this is a good use of a million H100s. Bloomberg reports 80% of chips headed to the UAE would go to US companies, 20% to G42. I very much want us to think about the actual physical consequences of various actions, not what those actions symbolize or look like. I do think, despite everything else, it is a very good sign that David Sacks is ‘urging people to read the fine print.’ This is moderated by the fact that we do not have the fine print, so we can’t read it. The true good news there requires one to read all that fine print, and one also should not assume that the fine print will get implemented. Nor do we yet have access to what the actual fine print says, so we cannot read it. Dylan Patel and others at Semianalysis offer a robust defense of the deal, saying clearly that ‘America wins’ and that this benefits American AI infrastructure suppliers on all levels, including AI labs and cloud providers. They focus on three benefits: money, tying KSA/UAE to our tech stack, and electrical power, and warn of the need for proper security, including model weight security, a point I appreciated them highlighting. Those seem like the right places to focus, and the right questions to ask. How much of their money is really up for grabs and how much does it matter? To what extent does this meaningfully tie UAE/KSA to America and how much does that matter? How much do we need their ability to provide electrical power? How will the security arrangements work, will they be effective, and who will effectively be in charge and have what leverage? Specifically, on their three central points: They call this macro, but a better term would be money. UAE and KSA (Saudi Arabia) can make it rain, a ‘trillion-dollar floodgate.’ This raises two questions. Question one: Was American AI ‘funding constrained’? The big tech companies were already putting in a combined hundreds of billions a year. Companies like xAI can easily raise funds to build giant data centers. If Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft wanted to invest more, are they really about to run out of available funding? Are there enough more chips available to be bought to run us out of cash? Semianalysis seems to think we should be worried about willingness of American companies to invest here and thinks we will have trouble with the financing. I am not convinced of this. Have you seen what these companies (don’t have to) pay on corporate bonds? Did we need to bring in outside investors? Should we even want to, given these investments look likely to pay off? This is a major crux. If indeed American big tech companies are funding constrained in their AI investments, then the money matters a lot more. Whereas if we were already capable of buying up all the chips, that very much cuts the other way. Question two: As we discussed earlier, is the trillion-dollar number real? We keep seeing these eye-popping headline investment numbers, but they don’t seem that anchored to reality, and seem to include all forms of investment including not AI, although of course other foreign direct investment is welcome. Do their investments in US datacenters mean anything, and are they even something we want, given that the limiting factor driving all this is either constraints on chip availability or on electrical power? Will this be crowding out other providers? If these deals are so positive for American tech companies, why didn’t the stock market moves reflect this? No, I will not accept ‘priced in.’ They call this geopolitical, that UAE and KSA are now tied to American technology stacks. As they say, ‘if Washington enforces tight security protocols.’ We will see. David Sacks is explicitly dismissing the need for tight security protocols. Classically, as Trump knows well, when the bank loans you a large enough amount and you don’t pay it back, it is the bank that has the problem. Who is being tied to whose stack? They will be able to at least cut the power any time. It is not clear from public info what other security will be present and what happens if they decide to turn on us, or use that threat as leverage. Can they take our chips and their talents elsewhere? This can almost be looked at as a deal with one corporation. G42 seems like it’s going to effectively be on the UAE side of the deal, and it is going to have a lot of chips in a lot of places. A key question is, to what extent do we have the leverage on and control over G42, and to what extent does this mean they will act as a de facto American tech company and ally? How much can we trust that our interests will continue to align? Who will be dependent on who? Will our security protocols extend to their African and European outposts? Why does buying a bunch of our chips tie them into the rest of our stack? My technical understand is that it doesn’t. They’re only tied to the extent that they agreed to be tied as part of the deal (again, details unknown), and they could swap out that part at any time. In my experience you can change which AI your program uses by changing a few lines of code, and people often do. It is not obvious why KSA and UAE using our software or tech stack is important to us other than because they are about to have all these chips. These aren’t exactly huge markets. If the argument is they have oversized effect on lots of other markets, we need to hear this case made out loud. Seminanalysis points out China doesn’t even have the capacity to sell its own AI chips yet. And I am confused about the perspectives here on ‘market share’ and the implied expectations about customer lock-in. They call this infrastructure, I’d simply call it (electrical) power. This is the clearly valuable thing we are getting. It’s rather crazy that ‘put our most strategic asset except maybe nukes into the UAE and KSA’ was chosen over ‘overrule permitting rules and build some power plants or convince one of our closer allies to do it’ but here we are. So the question here is, what are the alternatives? How acute is the shortage going to be and was there no one else capable of addressing it? Also, even if we do have to make this deal now, this is screaming from the rooftops, we need to build up more electrical power everywhere else now, so we don’t have this constraint again in the future. Semianalysis also raises the concern about model weight security, but essentially think this is solvable via funding work to develop countermeasures and use of red teaming, plus defense in depth. It’s great to see this concern raised explicitly, as it is another real worry. Yes, we could do work to mitigate it and impose good security protocols, and keep the models from running in places and ways that create this danger, but will we? I don’t know. Failure here would be catastrophic. There are also other concerns even if we successfully retain physical and digital control over the chips. The more we place AI chips and other strategic AI assets there, the more we are turning UAE, Saudi Arabia and potentially Qatar into major AI players, granting them leverage I believe they can and will use for various purposes. David Sacks continues to claim to not understand that others think that ‘winning AI’ is mostly not about who gets to sell chips, who uses our models and picks up market share, or about superficially ‘winning’ ‘deals.’ He not only thinks it is about market penetration, he can’t imagine an alternative. He doesn’t understand that many, including myself, this is about who has compute and who gets superintelligence, and about the need for proper security. David Sacks: I’m genuinely perplexed how any self-proclaimed “China Hawk” can claim that President Trump’s AI deals with UAE and Saudi Arabia aren’t hugely beneficial for the United States. As leading semiconductor analyst Dylan Patel observed, these deals “will noticeably shift the balance of power” in America’s favor. The only question you need to ask is: does China wish it had made these deals? Yes of course it does. But President Trump got there first and beat them to the punch. Sam Altman: this was an extremely smart thing for you all to do and i’m sorry naive people are giving you grief. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): One Trump administration official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that with the G42 deal, American policymakers were making a choice that could mean the most powerful A.I. training facility in 2029 would be in the United Arab Emirates, rather than the United States. [Jordan: this is a wild line to be giving to the NY Times—I thought all the China hawks already got purged!] But Trump officials worried that if the United States continued to limit the Emirates’ access to American technology, the Persian Gulf nation would try Chinese alternatives. The hawks are concerned, because the hawks largely do not think that the key question is who will get to sell chips, but rather who gets to buy them and use them. This is especially true given that both America and China are producing as many top AI chips as they can, us far more successfully, and there is more than enough demand for both of them. One must think on the margin. Given that so many China hawks are indeed on record doubting this deal, if you are perplexed by this I suggest reading their explanations. Here is one example. Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NYT): Mr. Goodrich said the United States still had the best A.I. engineers, companies and chips and should look for ways to speed up permitting and improve its energy grid to hold on to that expertise. Setting up some of the world’s largest data centers in the Middle East risks turning the Gulf States, or even China, into A.I. rivals, he said. “We’ve seen this movie before and we should not repeat it,” Mr. Goodrich said. Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the huge chip sales did “not feel consistent with an America First approach to A.I. policy or industrial policy.” “Why would we want to offshore the infrastructure that will underpin the key industrial technology of the coming years?” he asked. This does not seem like a difficult position to understand? There are of course also other reasons to oppose such deals. Here is Jordan Schneider of China Talk’s response, in which he is having absolutely none of it, explicitly rejecting that either America or China has chips to spare for this. rejecting that UAE and KSA are actual allies, not expecting us to follow through with reasonable security precautions, and saying if we wanted to do this anyway we could have held out for a better deal with more control than this, I don’t know why you would be confused how someone could have this reaction based on the publicly available information: Jordan Schneider: It’s going to cannibalize US build-out and leave the world with three independent power-centers of AI hardware where we could’ve stuck to our guns, done more power generation at home, and only had China to deal with not these wild-card countries that are not actual allies. If this really is as important as we believe, why are we letting these countries and companies we deeply distrust get access to it? The Gulf’s BATNA wasn’t Huawei chips, it was no chips. Whatever we’re trying to negotiate for, we can play harder to get. BIS can just say they can’t buy Ascends and it’s not like there’s enough capacity domestically in China to service global demand absent the TSMC loophole they charged through. Plus, we’re offering to sell them 10× the chips that Huawei could conceivably sell them anytime soon even if they use the TSMC-fabbed wafers. Where’s the art-of-the-deal energy here? Right now I only see AMD and NVDA shareholders as well as Sama benefiting from all of this. I thought we wanted to raise revenue from tariffs? Why not charge 3× the market rate and put the premium into the US Treasury, some “Make America Great Again” industrial-development fund, use it to triple BIS’ budget so they can actually enforce the security side, put them on the hook for Gaza…I don't know literally anything you care about. How about a commitment not to invest in Chinese tech firms? Do we still care about advanced logic made in America? How about we only let them buy chips fabbed in the US, fixing the demand-side problem and forcing NVDA to teach Intel how to not suck. Speaking of charging through loopholes, all of the security issues Dylan raises in his article I have, generously, 15 % confidence in USG being able to resolve/resist industry and politicians when they push back. If it’s so simple to just count the servers, why hasn’t BIS already done it / been able to fight upstream industry lobbying to update the chips-and-SME regs to stop Chinese build-outs and chip acquisition? What happens when the Trump gets a call from the King when some bureaucrat is trying to stop shipments because they see diversion if they ever catch it in the first place? Why are we doing anything with G42 again? Fine, if you really decide you want to sell chips to the UAE, at the very least give American hyperscalers the off-switch. It’s not like they would’ve walked away from that offer! America has a ton to lose in the medium term from creating another cloud provider that can service at scale, saying nothing of one that has some deeply-discomforting China ties pretty obvious even to me sitting here having never gotten classified briefings on the topic. Do the deal’s details and various private or unvoiced considerations make this deal better than it looks and answer many of these concerns? Could this be sufficient that, if looked at purely through the lens of American strategic interests, this deal was a win versus the salient alternatives? Again: That is all certainly possible! Our negotiating position could have been worse than Jordan believes. We could have gotten important things for America we aren’t mentioning yet. The administration could have limited room to maneuver including by being divided against itself or against Congress on this. On the flip side, there are some potentially uncharitable explanations for all of this, that would be reasonable to consider. Instead of understanding and engaging with such concerns and working to allay them, Sacks has repeatedly decided to make this a mask off moment, and engage in a response that I would expect on something like the All-In Podcast or in a Twitter beef, but which is unbecoming of his office and responsibilities, with multiple baseless vibe and ad hominem attacks at once that reflect that he either is willfully ignorant of the views, goals and beliefs of those he is attacking and even who they actually are, or he is lying and does not care, or both, and a failure to take seriously the concerns and objections being raised. Here is another illustration of this: David Sacks (May 17): After the Sam Bankrun-Fraud fiasco, it was necessary for the Effective Altruists to rebrand. So they are trying to position themselves as “China Hawks.” But their tech deceleration agenda is the same, and it would cost America the AI race with China. There are multiple other people I often disagree with on important questions but whom I greatly respect who are working on in administration on AI policy. There are good arguments you can make in defense of this deal. Instead of making those arguments in public, we repeatedly get this. Everything Sacks says seems to be about vibes and implications first and actual factual claims a distant second at best. He doesn’t logically say ‘all so-called China hawks who don’t agree with me are secret effective altruists in trench coats and also decels who hate all technology and all of humanity and also America,’ but you better believe that’s the impression he’s going for here. Would China have preferred to ‘do this deal’ instead? That at best assumes facts, and arguments, not in evidence. It depends what they would get out of such a deal, and what we’re getting out of ours, and also the security arrangements and whether we’ve formed a long lasting relationship in which we hold the cards. I’m also not even sure what it would mean for China to have ‘done this deal,’ it does not have what we are offering. Semianalysis says they don’t have similar quantities of chips to sell, and might not have any, nor are their chips of similar quality. I do agree China would have liked to ‘do a deal’ in some general sense, where they bring UAE/KSA into their orbit, on AI and otherwise, although they don’t need access to electrical power. More capital and friends are always helpful. It’s not clear what that deal would have looked like. [Jordan: the fact that the administration is citing some old news of Huawei promising to gift just $75m in chips to the Malaysian government (and not even today! Over two years!) is policy malpractice. Plus, this administration just made clear that using Huawei Ascend chips violates US export controls, giving America an enormously powerful lever to dissuade fence-sitting countries not to buy into what is already an inferior tech offering.] Here’s Tyler Cowen being clear eyed about some of what we are selling so cheap. The most powerful AI training facility could be in the UAE, and you’re laughing? Tyler Cowen: Of course Saudi and the UAE have plenty of energy, including oil, solar, and the ability to put up nuclear quickly. We can all agree that it might be better to put these data centers on US territory, but of course the NIMBYs will not let us build at the required speeds. Not doing these deals could mean ceding superintelligence capabilities to China first. Or letting other parties move in and take advantage of the abilities of the Gulf states to build out energy supplies quickly. Energy and ability to overcome NIMBYs is only that which is scarce because America is refusing to rise to this challenge and actually enable more power generation. Seriously, is there nowhere in America we can make this happen at scale? If we wanted to, we could do this ourselves easily. We have the natural gas, even if nuclear would be too slow to come online. It is a policy choice not to clear the way. And no, I see zero evidence that we are pulling out the stops here and coming up short. I think this frame is exactly correct - that this deal makes sense if and only if all of: The security deal is robust and we retain functional control over where the compute goes. We trust our friends here to remain our friends at a reasonable price. We counterfactually would not have been able to buy these chips and build data centers to power these chips. As far as I can tell China already has all the power it needs to power any AI chips it can produce, it is using them all, and its chip efforts are not funding constrained. So for want of electrical power, and for a few dollars, we are handing over a large amount of influence over the future to authoritarian powers with very different priorities and values? Tyler Cowen: In any case, imagine that soon the world’s smartest and wisest philosopher will soon again be in Arabic lands. We seem to be moving to a world where there will be four major AI powers — adding Saudi and UAE — rather than just two, namely the US and China. But if energy is what is scarce here, perhaps we were headed for additional AI powers anyway, and best for the US to be in on the deal? Who really will have de facto final rights of control in these deals? Plug pulling abilities? What will the actual balance of power and influence look like? Exactly what role will the US private sector play? Will Saudi and the UAE then have to procure nuclear weapons to guard the highly valuable data centers? Will Saudi and the UAE simply become the most powerful and influential nations in the Middle East and perhaps somewhat beyond? Yes. Those are indeed many of the right questions, once you think security is solid. Who is in charge of these data centers in the ways that matter? Won’t they at minimum have the ability to cut the power at any time? Who gets to decide where the compute goes? What are they going to do with all this leverage we are handing them? Is this what it means to have the future be based on American or Democratic values? Do you like ‘the values’ of the UAE and Saudi Arabian authorities? Tyler Cowen: I don’t have the answers to those questions. If I were president I suppose I would be doing these deals, but it is very difficult to analyze all of the relevant factors. The variance of outcomes is large, and I have very little confidence in anyone’s judgments here, my own included. Few people are shrieking about this, either positively or negatively, but it could be the series of decisions that settles our final opinion of the second Trump presidency. The administration thinks that the compute in question will remain under the indefinitely control of American tech companies, to be directed as we wish. Sriram Krishnan: Reflecting on what has been an amazing week and a key step in global American AI dominance under President Trump. These Middle East AI partnerships are historic and this “AI diplomacy” will help lock in the American tech stack in the region, help American companies expand there while also building infrastructure back in the U.S to continue expanding our compute capacity. This happens on top of rigorous security guarantees to stop diversion or unauthorized access of our technology. More broadly this helps pull the region closer to the U.S and aligns our technological interests in a very key moment for AI. It’s a very exciting moment and a key milestone. I hope that they are right about this, but I notice that I share Tyler’s worry that they are wrong. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s Humain is going to get ‘several hundred thousand’ of Nvidia’s most advanced processors, starting with 18k GB300 Grace Blackwells. The justification given for rescinding the Biden diffusion rules is primarily that failure to do this would have ‘weakened diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.’ But, well, not to reiterate everything I said last week, but on that note I have news. One, we’re weakening diplomatic relations with essentially all countries in a series of unforced errors elsewhere, and we could stop. [Jordan: that feeling when you treat Dubai better than Canada] Two, most of the listed tier two countries have always had second-tier status. There’s a reason Saudi Arabia isn’t in Five Eyes or NATO. We can talk price about which countries should have which status, but no our relations are not all created equal, not when it comes to strategically vital national interests and to deep trust. I don’t share Sacks’s stated view that these are some of our closest and most trustworthy allies. Why does this administration seem to always want to make its deals mostly with authoritarian regimes, usually in places where Trump has financial ties? Tripp Mickle and Ana Swanson (NY Times): The announcements of the two deals follow reports that $2 billion has flowed to Trump companies over the last month from the Middle East, including a Saudi-backed investment in Trump’s cryptocurrency and plans for a new presidential airplane from Qatar. There’s always Trust But Verify. The best solution, if you can’t trust, is often to set up things so that you don’t have to. This can largely be done. Will we do it? And what will we get in return? What is announced mostly seems to be investments and purchases, that what we are getting are dollars, and Bloomberg is skeptical of the stated dollar amounts. This deal is very much not a first best solution. It is, at best, a move that we are forced into on the margin due to our massive unforced errors in a variety of other realms. Even if it makes sense to do this, it makes even more sense to be addressing and fixing those other critical mistakes. Electrical power is the most glaring in the context of this particular. There needs to be national emergency level focus on America’s inability to build electrical power capacity. Where are the special compute zones? Where are the categorical exemptions? Where is DOGE with regard to the NRC? Where is the push for real reform on any of these fronts? Instead, we see story after story of Congress actively moving to withdraw even the supports that are already there, including plans to outright abrogate contracts on existing projects. The other very glaring issue is trade policy. If we think it is this vital to maintain trade alliances and open up markets, and maintaining market share, why are we otherwise going in the opposite direction? Why are we alienating most of our allies? And so on. The argument for this deal is, essentially, that it must be considered in isolation. That other stuff is someone else’s department, and we can only work with what we have. But this is a very bitter pill to be asked to swallow, especially as Sacks himself has spoken out quite loudly in favor of many of those same anti-helpful policies, and the others he seems to be sitting out. You can argue that he needs to maintain his political position, but if that also rules out advocating for electrical power generation and permitting reform, what are we even doing? If we swallow the entire pill, and consider these deals only on the margin, without any ability to impact any of our other decisions, and only with respect to ‘beating China’ and ability to ‘win the AI race,’ and assume fully good faith and set aside all the poor arguments and consider only the steelman case, we can ask: Do these deals help us? I believe that such a deal is justifiable, again on the margin and regarding our position with respect to China, if and only if ALL of the following are true: Security arrangements are robust, the chips actually do remain under our physical control and we actually do determine what happens with the compute. And things are set up such that America retains the leverage, and we can count on UAE/KSA to remain our friends going forward. This was essentially the best deal we could have gotten. This represents a major shift in our or China’s ability to stand up advanced AI chips, because for the bulk of these chips either Big Tech would have run out of money, or we would have been unable to source the necessary electrical power, or China has surplus advanced AI chips I was not previously aware of and no way to deploy them. Entering into these partnerships is more diplomatically impactful, and these friendships are more valuable, than they appear to me based on public info. ChinaTalk is a reader-supported publication.

I spent two years in a China Studies master’s program. It was fun reading Dream of the Red Chamber and Xi speeches — but I really wish I had come out of it with some hard skills, too. Had I only known about the University of San Francisco’s new Master of Science in Applied Economics Excellent commentary. I'm increasingly baffled by the inconsistencies in how the administration views AI. On one hand, it's the most important technology of the century, and will definitively decide the outcome of the U.S.-China competition. Yet we're willing to outsource and offshore data center development. I realize the analogy is flawed, but it has the same feeling as saying we want to outsource production of the B-21 because we have too many regulations, it will take too long to get permits and build, we can't afford it, and BTW we'll be able to provide oversight and monitoring of the manufacturing plant. Not something we would do in a million years. So if AI is that critical, why would we ever agree to this chip sales/data center deal--purported to result in what will become the largest cluster in the world? (While cutting BIS resources.) Rather than being about national self-interests, this has all the earmarks of a pure transactional agreement, centered on money and power. And while it's easy to be skeptical of the claims about AGI and ASI, if the assertion is that AI is going to be the most powerful, game-changing tech of the century, why should we ever stop states from trying to implement reasonable oversight and regulations? The states are doing it because there's a major gap at the federal level. The hyperbolic claims about over-regulation of AI during the previous administration are belied by the facts on the ground. In reality, the previous EOs directed very little regulation, outside mandating a number of actions within the government itself. I'm all for smart, tailored, less intrusive regulations. But it's really hard to justify scant or no regulatory actions, at the same time the administration is arguing that this technology will forever change the world. We're trying to create another Taiwan we have to protect lol No posts Ready for more?

Title: Bond Yields & Stocks: Something’s Happening Here
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/05/25/bond-yields--stocks-somethings-happening-here/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T12:24:45Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined. Despite some pundits being quite convinced that U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, “Something’s happening here, What it is ain’t exactly clear.” It is not disputed that 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted. Yields & Recession Odds Government bond yields in the U.S. have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the north has experienced a similar increase. 10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US Low Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global Yields If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the U.S. has seen slightly lower yields. 10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield Change The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the U.S. currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the U.S. dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The U.S. dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker U.S. dollar do not uniformly lead to higher U.S. Treasury bond yields. US Dollar Without exception, the fiscal position of large countries, as measured by government debt relative to GDP, deteriorated with the impact of spending during the pandemic. Most countries were already piling on more debt relative to economic activity, but the pandemic accelerated the trend. Government Debt-To-GDP There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn’t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems. Recent Government Debt-To-GDP Ratios The U.S. House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the U.S. fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation’s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The U.S. Senate will almost certainly make some changes. So, the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the U.S. and global economy. President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week. Betting Odds of 2025 US Recession Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday’s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields does not point to a U.S.-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the U.S. is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn’t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.

Title: Bond Yields & Stocks: Something’s Happening Here

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined. Despite some pundits being quite convinced that U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, “Something’s happening here, What it is ain’t exactly clear.” It is not disputed that 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted. Yields & Recession Odds Government bond yields in the U.S. have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the north has experienced a similar increase. 10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US Low Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global Yields If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the U.S. has seen slightly lower yields. 10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield Change The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the U.S. currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the U.S. dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The U.S. dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker U.S. dollar do not uniformly lead to higher U.S. Treasury bond yields.

Title: ELV FRAUD: Suffer Losses on Elevance Health, Inc.? You may have been Affected by Fraud and are Urged to Contact BFA Law (NYSE:ELV)

May 25, 2025 07:42 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Walmart layoffs: Who is Suresh Kumar, Indian-origin CTO called out by social media users amid recent job cuts?

Suresh Kumar, the Indian origin chief technology officer of Walmart in California, has hit the headlines amid reports of the retail giant cutting 1,500 tech jobs. Walmart is cutting jobs at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, along with its global technology team. In a memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Walmart CTO Suresh Kumar and US CEO John Furner indicated that the decision to reduce the workforce by nearly 1,500 employees is intended to speed up decision-making and lessen complexities. After reports on layoffs emerged, several social media users blamed CTO Suresh Kumar for the recent layoffs. Suresh Kumar is the executive vice president, global chief technology officer (CTO), and chief development officer (CDO) of Walmart. With more than three decades of experience in the tech industry, he has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Suresh Kumar currently lives in Sunnyvale, California. Speaking to the Times of India earlier, Kumar shared that he was born in Basavanagudi, Bengaluru and spent his childhood there. Kumar pursued his Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree in Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. He secured a PhD in control systems from Princeton University. The Walmart CTO recently shared his experience of studying at IIT. In a post on LinkedIn, he wrote, “I completed my undergrad time in the late ‘80s, and one truth still stands out: learning never stops.” He also offered guidance for recent graduates, encouraging them to stay curious, connect with inspiring individuals, and take pride in their work. Kumar's post read, “Stay curious. Don’t just master your role - learn how your work connects to the bigger picture. Curiosity is a career superpower. Seek out people who inspire you. Ask questions. Listen deeply. Mentorship can come from unexpected places—look for those who challenge your thinking.” He further added, “Take pride in your work. Excellence starts with the mindset you bring every day. The habits you build early on will shape your path.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

With the bond-market selloff spooking investors across the board, stocks finished last week in the red. The Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all fell. Disappointing retail data kept piling up, too, with Target’s earnings portraying a sharp drop in confidence among middle and high-income households, while Home Depot and Lowe’s showed a slowdown in home renovations. New data released by the National Association of Realtors added to the drama, as existing-home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million in April — down 0.5% from March and 2.4% from a year ago. Now investors are set to return from Memorial Day barbecues to a shorter yet still jam-packed week. Here’s what to watch: U.S. markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day. Tuesday kicks off the shortened trading week with a batch of earnings that should offer fresh data into how American consumers are faring — and feeling. BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ+0.59%) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM-0.29%) both report before the bell. Analysts will be watching BJ’s for any signs of trading-down behavior or shrinking basket sizes, both windows into customers’ confidence levels. Okta (OKTA-0.92%) also reports Tuesday, with analysts expecting positive earnings vs. a quarterly loss this time last year. Wednesday is the marquee day of the week, with heavyweight earnings from Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), the third-largest company in America by market cap, as well as Salesforce (CRM-0.74%) and Veeva Systems (VEEV-0.13%), plus the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s report after the bell will surely be the most closely watched: The chipmaker has become a virtual stand-in for the AI wave and global chip war, and analysts are predicting as much as a 7% move in the price. Also after market close, Salesforce will offer updates on enterprise software spending amid growing economic uncertainty. Veeva will shed light on cloud-based trends in pharma and biotech. Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS-3.06%) is also set to report. The biggest macro flashpoint comes at 2:00 p.m. ET, when the Federal Reserve releases minutes from its May 6-7 meeting. No surprises are expected, but with investors speculating whether rate cuts might come in the second half of 2025, you can expect articles analyzing the log for any insight into inflation, the labor market, or internal dissent. Costco (COST-0.22%), Dell, Zscaler (ZS+0.24%), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA-0.04%) all report Thursday. Investors will be watching Costco for traffic trends, membership retention, and its food versus discretionary sales mix, especially given Walmart’s (WMT+0.77%) recent gains in grocery. Ulta Beauty’s report will portray the health of mascara and shampoo spending — areas that often remain surprisingly strong even when consumers pull back in other categories. Gotta keep those highlights looking fresh, no matter the macro outlook. Dell Technologies (DELL-3.07%) and Zscaler round out the day’s marquee tech names. Dell’s outlook will be read for enterprise PC refresh cycles and demand for AI-capable hardware, while Zscaler’s earnings will offer a look at corporate cybersecurity priorities in an atmosphere of belt-tightening. With no major economic releases or U.S.-listed heavyweights reporting, Friday may make for a quieter session — a nice little reprieve after the flurry of earnings and macro headlines. Only Up Fintech (TIGR-0.42%), a large China-based brokerage firm, is scheduled to report. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
