Title: Germany: New Merz cabinet raises concerns over lobbying

No sooner had Friedrich Merz announced new government positions than accusations of "lobbyism" began to fly. How is lobbying regulated in Germany — and how big a problem is it? Newly elected Chancellor Friedrich Merz, from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), himself a former lobbyist for global investment firm BlackRock, has taken the somewhat unusual step in German politics of appointing three people directly from the world of business to top cabinet jobs. The new minister of economic affairs and energy is Katherina Reiche (CDU), returning to government after a stint as managing director of the Association of Municipal Enterprises (VKU) and CEO of energy provider Westenergie, a subsidiary of one of Europe's largest energy concerns E.ON since 2020. The environmentalist Green Party, now back in opposition, has described her as a "gas lobbyist." Germany's new culture and media commissioner is media entrepreneur Wolfram Weimer, a former editor-in-chief of right-wing newspaper Welt with no previous experience in government of any kind. The Weimer Media Group founded by Weimer and his wife Christiane Goetz-Weimer hosts annual meetings where power players from business, politics and media gather to network. Since his appointment to the cabinet, Weimer has announced that his wife will now take over as sole managing director of the media group. The new minister for digitalization and state modernization, Karsten Wildberger, gave up his job as CEO of listed electronics retail group Ceconomy, parent company of two of Germany's largest consumer electronics chains MediaMarkt and Saturn, in order to take up his new job. Like Weimer, Wildberger has never been a politician, elected or otherwise. The socialist Left Party co-leader Ines Schwedtner criticized the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the CDU/CSU's coalition partner in government, for supporting what she called a "CDU lobbyist cabinet." While it's not the norm that people from business move straight into cabinet positions in Germany, it is becoming more common, according to Norman Loeckel, an expert on lobbying regulation at anti-corruption organization Transparency Germany. "It's actually better if you take someone who has the knowledge and expertise than a member of parliament who doesn't. But if there is a conflict of interest, that is a very critical situation and there are no rules curtailing this effectively in Germany," Loeckel told DW. Lobbying refers to the phenomenon of interest groups attempting to influence political decision-making in their favor, and is central to the functioning of a pluralistic democracy. Interest groups can include trade and consumer associations, NGOs, charities, foundations, churches, PR agencies that lobby on behalf of clients, think tanks and other research institutes, and state actors such as municipalities or federal ministries. As of 2022, lobbyists in Germany must register in a database called the Lobby Register. This includes all those who contact members of parliament, their staff, parliamentary groups and the federal government. But there are exceptions: Churches, trade unions and employers' associations are not required by law to register, although they may do so voluntarily. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Anyone who intentionally or negligently fails to register or update information correctly and completely, or not in a timely manner, could be prosecuted under the Lobby Register Act and be hit with a fine of up to €50,000 ($57,000). Donations to political parties over €10,000 must be published. It was also decided in 2021 that members of the Bundestag would have to declare company shareholdings and additional income of over €1,000 per month or €3,000 per year. Lawmakers also must abide by the Member of Parliament Act which regulates what secondary activities and income must be declared. It explicitly states that it is illegal to accept money or benefits of a monetary value in return for representing, promoting or protecting particular interests. Cabinet ministers are barred from working any type of second job under the Federal Ministers Act, even on a voluntary basis — but this does not apply to the majority of members of parliament who are not in the cabinet. Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers who want to switch from politics to business must notify the authorities if they intend to take up employment outside of the public sector. They can be subject to a mandatory "cooling-off" period of up to 18 months. In Germany, more lobbyists have access to the German Bundestag than there are members of parliament. There are currently almost 6,000 companies, associations, organizations, networks, individuals and others on the register — the list of designated employees who directly represent their interests numbers more than 27,000. Anti-corruption campaign groups, including Transparency Germany and Lobbycontrol, have also long called for the introduction of a so-called "executive footprint" documenting how federal bills came into being. The proposal has found its way into the rules of procedure for government ministries, but these rules are not binding and those who violate them do not face consequences. "In general in Germany, unless there is a big scandal, nothing happens. Almost all of the rules in Germany that limits lobbying, that bind politicians to certain rules, came into being because of a scandal," Loeckel told DW. The push for Germany's Lobby Register that led to its introduction in 2022 gained momentum in 2020 after CDU politician Philipp Amthor lobbied for US company Augustus Intelligence in return for stock options. Amthor also wrote letters to the Economy Ministry seeking "political support" for the startup of which he was also a board member. Cabinet ministers may be barred from having second jobs under the Member of Parliament Act, but this does not apply to other members of the Bundestag. Members of parliament are also not obliged to disclose any assets they or their family members own, aside from company shareholdings of over 5%. The Member of Parliament Act also does not apply to cabinet members like Reiche, Wildberger and Weimer who are not elected members of the Bundestag. "The only law that ministers have to obey is the Federal Minister Act. In reality the only real regulation is that cabinet ministers cannot have second jobs and that there must be a cooling-off period before switching from politics to business," said Loeckel. The cooling-off period was introduced in 2015 after a number of scandals, most prominently involving former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the SPD. Shortly before leaving office in 2005, Schröder signed a deal between Germany and Russian state-owned Gazprom to build the NordStream 1 gas pipeline, and then joined the board of directors of the NordStream joint venture. While the so-called "revolving door" between business and politics may be slowed by the cooling-off period, Transparency Germany wants this extended from a minimum of 18 months to a maximum of three years if conflicts arise. "In theory, you also have the code of conduct but it is not a law and you can break the rules and nobody will care. If there's no scandal there's no problem, at least from their point of view," said Loeckel.

Title: Corporate America’s DEI standoff: Why major companies are defying the backlash

Major companies like Costco, Apple, Leviâs and Goldman Sachs rejected shareholder proposals to dismantle DEI programs, despite conservative activism, showing a divide between political rhetoric and corporate governance. Large institutional investors (e.g., BlackRock, Vanguard) side with management, signaling Wall Streetâs belief in DEIâs financial benefits. While DEI opponents cite the Supreme Court's 2023 race-based admissions ruling, it doesn't apply to private companies. Meanwhile, Trump-era threats (e.g., federal contract losses) pressure firms like Meta to scale back initiatives. Anti-DEI groups use shareholder proposals to pressure companies (e.g., PepsiCo dropping minority representation goals), but many firms rebrand DEI efforts without abandoning core diversity commitments. Despite political backlash, 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts. The debate hinges on whether corporate Americaâs stance holds under escalating legal and political scrutiny.

Despite political backlash, 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts. The debate hinges on whether corporate Americaâs stance holds under escalating legal and political scrutiny. While the populist narrative claims that MAGA-aligned forces are dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across corporate America,Â some of the nation's largest companies are refusing to back down. Shareholders at Costco, Apple, Leviâs, John Deere and Goldman Sachs have rejected proposals to scrap DEI programs, despite pressure from conservative activists. In recent months, conservative think tanks like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) have spearheaded shareholder proposals demanding companies abandon DEI policies, citing legal risks and accusations of "reverse discrimination." At Costco, more than 98 percent of shareholders voted against a proposal to audit DEI-related business risks, with the board arguing diversity strengthens customer satisfaction. Similar defeats unfolded at Apple, Levi's and Goldman Sachs. (Related: Meta scraps DEI initiatives amid broader corporate retreat from diversity policies.) Why DEI still has corporate backing DEI programs encompass hiring practices, leadership training and supplier diversity efforts aimed at increasing representation for women, minorities, veterans and people with disabilities. CriticsÂ like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO and close advisor to President Donald Trump, say DEI represents "reverse racism." Major institutional investors â BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street â control vast voting shares and typically side with management. Their resistance to anti-DEI measures suggests Wall Street sees financial value in these programs, regardless of political headwinds. Opponents claim DEI violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against race-based college admissions. However, that decision applies only to public institutions, not private corporations. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has aggressively targeted DEI, pressuring companies like Meta and Target to scale back initiatives under threat of lost federal contracts. Yet, shareholder votes reveal a disconnect. While some firms quietly retreat, others â like Costco and Cisco â are digging in. Conservative groups admit their proposals are less about winning votes and more about applying pressure. The NLPC withdrew a similar motion at PepsiCo after the company agreed to drop minority representation goals for managers. Despite political rhetoric, DEI isnât disappearing. Companies are rebranding initiativesâdropping the term "DEI" while maintaining diversity hiring pipelines. A Paradigm survey found 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts, even if they're less vocal. In the coming weeks, Attorney General Pam Bondi is expected to submit a report with recommendations to "encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI,"Â including each agency's list of up to nine civil compliance investigations. For now, corporate America's message is clear: DEI may be controversial in politics, but in the boardroom, it's still seen as good business. The fight over DEI is far from over, but the latest shareholder votes prove corporate America isn't capitulating to political pressure. One thing is certain: the debate over DEI will define not just workplaces, but the future of American capitalism itself. President Donald Trump sends DEI to its end. Watch this video.

Title: Obituary: David Doyle, businessman and son of of legendary hotelier whose time in charge of the family business repeatedly hit the headlines

Time Published: 2025-05-11T01:30:00Z
Full Content:
David Doyle became a shrewd investor and a successful hotelier David Doyle, whose ­private funeral was held in ­Dublin last Thursday, was the younger son of legendary hotelier Pascal Vincent (PV) Doyle and took over the mantle of running the Doyle Hotel group for a time following the sudden death of his father, who had built the international chain of hotels from scratch. Mr Doyle, who lived between his home in Spain and his mansion on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin, died at the age of 67 on May 2 after living with motor neurone disease for some time. David Doyle was the second youngest of the five children of the builder and hotelier PV Doyle and his wife Margaret: Michael, Eileen, Anne, David and Bernadette. He grew up in the family mansion, Thornhill, in spacious grounds in Mount Merrion, Co Dublin, beside the Cherrygarth Estate which his father built. He went to school in Blackrock College and the College of Catering in Cathal Brugha Street, Dublin. Although born with the proverbial silver spoon, David, like his siblings, was expected to work in the family business. From about the age of 12 he learned his trade in the kitchens and bars of the Doyle hotels, ­before going to the US to work in the ­famous ­Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los ­Angeles. I can’t honestly say that there was a time when I didn’t want to go into the hotel business On returning to Dublin, he was appointed an assistant manager in his father’s flagship hotel, the Berkeley Court in Ballsbridge, built in the grounds of the former Trinity College Botanical Gardens and, in the mid-1980s, it was the most stylish hotel in Dublin. “I can’t honestly say that there was a time when I didn’t want to go into the hotel business,” he later admitted. When PV died suddenly in 1988 at the age of 64, it seemed the ­pecking order within the family had ­already been settled. Although he left everything to his wife Margaret, ­David became chief executive of the hotel group, with his younger sister Bernie (Bernadette) retaining her ­position as international marketing executive and second in command. Their elder brother Michael had taken over the building arm of the family business. “David and Bernie complemented each other and they were exceptionally close,” said one insider at the time. “He was running the business and she was marketing manager and they had offices next door to each other in the Burlington Hotel. It seemed like the ideal way to run the business.” His best friend at the time was ­another ambitious young Dublin ­hotel executive, John Fitzpatrick, whose ­father, Paddy, was a well-known figure in the hotel business. Their sons hung out with a “rat pack” of well-heeled bachelor friends. John Fitzpatrick returned from New York, where he had been ­dispatched by his father to open and run Fitzpatrick’s Hotel in Manhattan, to be best man when David Doyle married former air hostess Christina Kelly at a lavish wedding in Dublin. Some of his friends, who included Gerry Purcell, Michael Smurfit Jr, John Gallagher, Des McEvaddy and Paul Doody, hired a small aeroplane to fly over the church in Foxrock trailing a banner saying “your goose is cooked” that Saturday, May 4, 1991. However, over the next two years tensions within the Doyle family began to manifest, with his three sisters — including Bernie who was now married to John Gallagher — unhappy at the direction the business was taking. “It was generally felt in the industry that David and the family had a falling out over his policy of heavy investment in the existing hotel properties,” reported The Irish Times. Adding to the tension was David Doyle’s confidence in his own ability. “PV was frequently described paradoxically as a benevolent autocrat. Unfortunately, David appeared to have inherited his father’s iron will and tendency to take decisions without bothering too much about extensive consultations,” read one profile. David Doyle also wanted to team up with the worldwide Marriott chain to put the brand name on some of the hotels in the group. This did not find favour with the family matriarch, Margaret, who ultimately controlled the business and regarded “Doyle” as a ­better calling card. After a series of boardroom clashes David called senior hotel staff together on the evening of Wednesday June 15, 1994, and with tears in his eyes told them he was leaving the family ­business. “It is no secret in the financial world that PV’s widow ­Margaret and her five children and their respective wives and husbands are deeply divided,” wrote Sunday ­Independent social diarist Trevor Danker, later that year. Then just as suddenly as he had left to “pursue other interests”, the Doyle Hotel Group announced that David Doyle was back. Under the new arrangement his mother gave up her controlling interest to her five children. David became managing director, with Bernie taking the role of deputy chairman. Executive Paddy Galvin, who had run Waterford Glass, was appointed chairman. Some years earlier David had been asked about how he got on with other members of his family, particularly his father: “Every day we have hundreds of disagreements — that’s what business is about,” he answered. Within a short time fundamental differences resurfaced. Elder brother Michael made it clear as soon as the in-fighting resumed that he wanted out. It is estimated that he got over £20m, with his share of the company divided among the remaining siblings. ­David offered to buy out his sisters for £100m. They turned him down. On July 4, 1997, it was announced in a terse statement that the board of the company had voted him out of office and Bernadette would resume the position. Two years later the family reached a settlement and David sold out all but a small percentage of his holding for £40m. He spent the remainder of his life as a shrewd investor in a range of business ventures in Ireland and abroad. He would figure briefly in another corporate battle. In 1999 the Doyle sisters agreed to merge with their Ballsbridge rivals to form a public company, Jury’s Doyle. Between them they walked away with £398m in cash and retained a 23pc stake in the new company, making them three of the richest women in Ireland. The only stipulation PV’s widow made to the deal was that her husband’s portrait should continue to hang in pride of place in the lobbies of the hotels he had founded. In 2005, what became known as the Battle of Ballsbridge commenced as canny developers realised some of the sites in the Jury’s Doyle hotel group were worth more than the buildings that occupied them. As 13 rival consortia hoovered up shares in Jury’s Doyle, the prime site, Jury’s Hotel, was put up for sale. In the end it was sold to developer Seán Dunne for €275m, and he threw in another €119m to acquire the adjacent Berkeley Court Hotel. In return he sold a huge parcel of shares in Jury’s Doyle back to the three Doyle sisters, who got most of their father’s hotels back and realigned the business as The Doyle Collection. When David Doyle sold his 1.2 million shares in Jury’s Doyle back to his sisters, he is believed to have netted another €40m, as the shares were driven sky high in the bidding war. David Doyle lived well off the fortune he made from the family business. His brother Michael was mentioned in his death notice, but not his three sisters. He died in Spain and is survived by his wife Christina and their daughters Ashley and Sophie. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock Meets With SEC To Discuss Staking, Tokenization, Others – Details

Time Published: 2025-05-10T22:00:09Z

Executives of American investment firm BlackRock met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‘s crypto task force on Friday to discuss various matters pertaining to cryptocurrency spot exchange-traded products (ETPs). This discussion, among other recent developments in the administration of US President Donald Trump, represents the growing American interest in the crypto industry. According to a memo released by the SEC on Friday, BlackRock representatives met the agency’s crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Pierce, to “address several issues related to regulation in crypto assets.” In particular, the briefing between both parties touched on staking in ETFs, which has become a major talking point in recent months. In particular, BlackRock sought to discuss the Commission’s perspective on staking and the potential for permitting exchange-traded funds with staking options. Notably, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed for a proposed rule change in February that will introduce staking in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. If the SEC approves this application, Grayscale would be allowed to lock up portions of the crypto assets in its ETF holdings to generate additional income for the Trust. In April, the SEC delayed a decision on this request. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously stated there is much potential for the Commission to hold approval until the final deadline in October, despite the intermediate deadlines in May and August. In addition to Grayscale, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) has also filed a similar request for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. Aside from staking in ETFs, BlackRock and the SEC also conversed on ways of advancing the tokenization of securities in line with existing federal securities laws. Notably, BlackRock offers the BUIDL token, which is a tokenized money market fund that invests in high-quality government securities such as treasury bills. Furthermore, both parties also discussed the need for clear standards that determine the rejection or approval of a crypto ETP, which would also consider the provisions of Section 6 of the Exchange Act that ensure ETP trading will only happen on a regulated exchange. While this framework is being drafted, BlackRock also proposed the creation of a temporary regulatory system for ETP issuer activity. The final talking point between both parties explored the requirements for setting positions and exercise limits on crypto ETPs trading options, with a focus on how the liquidity of the underlying assets influences those limits. At presstime, the total crypto market is valued at $3.22 trillion following a 1.19% gain in the past day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Big Layoffs Are Hitting These Sectors The Hardest

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Depressed businesswoman getting laid off from her job, talking to her colleagues while carrying her ... More belongings and leaving the job. Layoffs have surged across an array of industries. Some of the problems are caused by a volatile economic landscape. President Trump’s initial tariff policy put a scare into both corporate executives and consumers. Additionally, technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, are changing the workplace. Corporate restructurings due to changing circumstances added to the trend of layoffs. With more than 221,812 jobs eliminated in the first months of the year, workers and companies alike are forced to confront an ever changing challenging environment. Layoffs in 2025 are reshaping the workforce. Government, tech, retail, accounting, manufacturing, and logistics have been dealing with the biggest cuts. Driven by tariffs, cost-cutting, AI adoption, and federal downsizing, these layoffs show a shift in the economy. For workers, they’ll need to stay proactive with upskilling, networking, and building financial resilience to navigate this storm. The layoff wave has spared few industries. Some sectors have borne the brunt more than others. Approximately one-third of layoffs stem from the government sector or related industries. Driven by federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration, agencies like the National Park Service (1,500 layoffs), U.S. Geological Survey (1,000), and the Bureau of Reclamation (100–150) are implementing significant reductions in force (RIFs). Tech The tech sector has the dubious honor of leading in layoffs, per TechCrunch. Over 23,400 jobs were cut in April alone. Companies like CrowdStrike (500 layoffs), Meta, Microsoft, and Block are downsizing. By comparison, 2024 saw 150,000 tech job cuts across 549 firms. High-profile firms like Amazon, Google, and Tesla also contributed to the tally. According to layoffs.fyi, 52,340 tech employees were laid off from around 123 tech companies. There were roughly 61,296 gov’t employees laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE initiatives, and about 171,843 total federal departures in 2025. U.S. retailers eliminated over 64,000 jobs in the first four months of 2025. This made the retail sector the second-hardest-hit industry after technology and ahead of most other consumer-facing industries, reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Bankruptcies at Joann Fabrics (19,000 jobs), Party City (16,000), and Big Lots (1,000) account for significant losses, with other retailers cutting jobs to brace for economic pressures like tariffs. Big Four management consultancy PwC laid off 1,500 U.S. workers (2% of its workforce), following 1,800 cuts in 2024. Other similar firms such as KPMG, EY, and Deloitte have also announced layoffs, citing low attrition and pressure on profit margins. Companies like Volvo (125 layoffs at its Charleston plant), General Motors (1,695 at its Fairfax Assembly plant), and Mercedes-Benz have announced mass layoffs. These cuts are tied to production pauses and cost-cutting amid economic uncertainty. UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs in 2025, citing global trade policy changes and tariffs that discourage shipping. Trucking and retail are also expected to face mass layoffs due to tariff-driven economic pressures. The Trump administration’s tariffs are disrupting supply chains and raising costs, particularly in retail, logistics, and manufacturing. UPS explicitly cited “changes in global trade policy” as a driver for its 20,000 job cuts. Economists warn that tariffs could trigger stagflation or a recession, further pressuring companies to downsize. Many companies are streamlining operations to boost efficiency or profitability. CrowdStrike’s 5% workforce reduction aims to achieve a $10 billion annual recurring revenue target, while PwC’s layoffs address low attrition and bottom-line pressures. Tech firms are cutting middle managers and embracing AI-driven or self-led teams. The rise of AI and automation is displacing jobs, particularly in tech and manufacturing. Retail giants like Joann Fabrics and Party City faced bankruptcies, leading to massive layoffs. Even surviving retailers like Big Lots are cutting jobs to stabilize finances. The Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal government has led to mass firings and hiring freezes, with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) initially issuing but later revoking some layoff notices. This creates uncertainty for federal workers. What Should Workers Know About Layoffs Here’s what you need to know and what to do. Monitor your sector for signs of instability. Retail and tech workers should be vigilant, given their high layoff rates. Federal employees need to track policy changes, as further RIFs are expected. Resources like WARNTracker.com and Layoffs.fyi provide real-time data on announced layoffs. In tech, generic skills won’t cut it. Identify niche skills your employer or competitors lack. This includes AI tools. If your company doesn’t offer it, invest in training to keep current and ahead of the pack. For retail or manufacturing workers, cross-training in adjacent roles like logistics or e-commerce. Continuous learning is a non-negotiable, as you don’t want to be left behind. Layoffs often come with little warning. Severance packages may be minimal or not offered. Put aside an emergency fund that can last at least around 6–12 months of living expenses in savings. Don’t feel it’s beneath you to take on a side hustle to bring home some much needed money. Start networking. Relationships can open doors to new opportunities. Engage with industry peers on platforms like LinkedIn, attend virtual or in-person events, and reconnect with former colleagues. A strong network can help you land a role before layoffs hit. Layoffs can feel personal, especially when companies like Meta label affected workers as “low performers.” Don’t let it bring you down. Seek advice and support from mentors or career coaches. Reframe a layoff as an opportunity to pivot to a more stable or fulfilling role. To be fair, it’s easy said than done. Tariffs and trade wars are sometimes scapegoats for companies. They may use these trends to conduct firings, pivoting to AI-driven models. The tech sector’s volatility, for instance, isn’t solely about innovation. The tech sector misjudged the market and overhired during the pandemic boom. Now companies are paying for it by over-correcting to appease shareholders. Workers should be skeptical of corporate narratives. When companies cite “low attrition” as a layoff rationale, it’s often code for protecting profits over people. Similarly, the “low performer” label at Meta looks like a tactic to deflect blame from poor strategic planning. The real risk for workers isn’t just losing a job. It’s being left behind in an economy increasingly prioritizing automation. On the flip side, this chaos presents opportunities. Sectors like healthcare and transportation are adding jobs, and remote work remains a viable path in tech. Workers who adapt by mastering high-demand skills, building personal brands, or exploring entrepreneurial ventures can thrive despite the uncertainty. The key is self-leadership. Keep your eyes open for opportunities. Don’t wait for employers to dictate your future.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Mira Murati, the former chief technology officer of OpenAI and a central figure behind ChatGPT, is launching her own AI startup, and she’s doing it in blockbuster fashion. Thinking Machines Lab, the AI company founded by Murati early this year, is raising a $2 billion seed round at a $10 billion valuation. According to Business Insider, the round is being led by Andreessen Horowitz, with support from Sequoia Capital and other top-tier investors. Those interested in backing the venture are being asked to commit a minimum of $50 million per check, a staggering requirement for what would be one of the largest seed rounds in startup history. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. The startup's ambition is to reshape the way artificial intelligence is built and understood. According to the company’s website, Thinking Machines Lab will focus on making AI “more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable,” highlighting a shift toward both transparency and user control. That positioning places the company in direct conceptual competition with AI giants like OpenAI, Google's Gemini, Elon Musk's xAI, and Anthropic, which are all currently racing to define the next generation of large language models and autonomous systems, Business Insider reported. Murati spent more than six years at OpenAI, contributing to the development of ChatGPT and other advanced AI research projects. According to Business Insider, she was briefly appointed interim CEO in November 2023, after the board unexpectedly removed Sam Altman, a decision that triggered internal upheaval across the company. Following Altman's reinstatement just days later, Murati returned to her position as chief technology officer.

Andreessen Horowitz, the legendary venture capital firm that previously backed Facebook and Airbnb ABNB, Financial Times reported, is leading the round alongside Sequoia Capital, known for its investments in Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and WhatsApp, Fortune says. Their involvement may signal strong institutional belief in Murati's long-term potential. Thinking Machines Lab is also assembling a brain trust of former OpenAI engineers and scientists. According to The Founders Magazine, team members include Bob McGrew, former head of research at OpenAI, Alec Radford, one of the minds behind the original GPT, Barret Zoph, a top researcher on ChatGPT, and John Schulman, co-lead of the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technique that powers modern AI safety.

Few early-stage startups command minimum investments in the tens of millions. According to Business Insider, Murati’s $50 million threshold is a practical necessity since training large models and building scalable infrastructure requires capital on a massive scale. If the raise closes as expected, Thinking Machines Lab will stand beside OpenAI and Anthropic as one of the most well-capitalized AI startups in the world, Business Insider says, and one of the only ones led by a woman. With technical vision, elite backing, and a mission to open up the black box of AI, Murati's next chapter may reshape the way the world builds and interacts with intelligent systems.

Title: BlackRock Files For In-Kind Creation/Redemption For Ethereum Spot ETF – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-in-kind-creation-redemption-ethereum-etf/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T19:00:25Z
Full Content:
American investment firm BlackRock has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that will allow the in-kind creation and redemption of its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). This development comes three months after the asset manager made a similar application for its Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 9, BlackRock filed an amendment to the S-1 form of the Ethereum spot ETF ETHA that would permit an in-kind creation and redemption process for the fund. For context, crypto spot ETFs generally operate a cash creation and redemption process where authorized participants exchange cash for shares of an ETF. At the point of redemption, these shares are returned for the equivalent of their cash value. However, in an in-kind system, shares are directly exchanged for the base cryptocurrency between investors and the ETF issuers. This system allows ETF issuers to directly increase their cryptocurrency holdings without parting ways with any available cash. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, BlackRock’s application represents the first to push for in-kind creation/redemption in Ethereum ETFs after the asset manager filed a similar one for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in January 2025. Notably, there is a final deadline around November 10, 2025, at which the SEC is expected to give a definite response to this proposed change on BlackRock’s ETHA. In BlackRock’s S-1 amendment for an in-kind creation/redemption system, the asset manager highlights multiple risks, which can be described as the conventional risks all investors should know before directly or indirectly engaging with the crypto market. In particular, James Seyffart draws attention to a whole paragraph on the risk of Quantum computing. Here, BlackRock warns that significant advancements in Quantum computing in the coming years might provide opportunities to attack the cryptographic algorithm of digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, thereby undermining the assets’ security. Although there are steps by certain network members to create a cryptographic algorithm that would be immune to Quantum computing developments, there is little evidence to show that such Quantum-proof systems can be completely built or even implemented without causing network forks. However, Seyffart tells investors that there is no cause for alarm; these are part of the basic risks of digital assets, which BlackRock is mandated to disclose. Other dangers mentioned in the amendment proposal include potential exchange collapse, e.g, FTX, governance policy, and volatility. At press time, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,347 following a 28.38% gain in the past week. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 48.38% on its monthly chart amidst a general crypto market resurgence.

Title: Intel's distributed manufacturing might have given it a lifeline

Time Published: 2025-05-10T18:00:19Z

Let’s be honest — Intel has been down in the dumps lately. Between the awful Raptor Lake instability scandal, disappointing Arrow Lake launch, canceling the much-hyped 20A node, and waves of layoffs, the chipmaker seems stuck playing defense. Intel's stock price hasn't recovered from the massive drop, and AMD continues to rack up wins. Even Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, publicly acknowledged the myriad of challenges the company is facing. What you might have missed, however, is that Intel has been nurturing a long-term manufacturing pivot to redefine its role in the global semiconductor ecosystem. Possible tariffs on semiconductor chips from outside the U.S. are only the latest incentive for Intel to increase local manufacturing. With billions invested in both domestic and international fab expansion, and a resurgent foundry business, Intel is trying to become the top player in a world that cares a lot more about where the chips are coming from. It won't be easy, but it's necessary In case you didn't know, Intel holds the most U.S.-based manufacturing plants among chipmakers, which could be a huge shield against new semiconductor tariffs in the near future. Once the biggest chip manufacturer in the world, Intel, for the first time, outsourced the manufacturing of a major CPU lineup to TSMC. Intel's in-house foundry failed to meet expectations, and it was forced to use TSMC's cutting-edge process nodes. Thanks to the $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding by the government, Intel has received the green light to invest in projects across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The CHIPS Act funds alone aren't nearly enough, but that hasn't stopped Intel from pouring $32 billion into two new fabs in Arizona, around $3.5 billion into advanced packaging plants in New Mexico, and $28 billion into two new fabs in Ohio (production is delayed to 2030, though). Even Oregon is getting a 300mm foundry plant. If the Trump administration goes through with additional tariffs on non-U.S. chips, Intel's domestic manufacturing capabilities could prove to be a strong moat. Almost every company outsources its chip manufacturing to TSMC, Samsung, and other Asian fabs, so Intel's strong domestic base can be one of the key levers in its gradual revival. The company is clearly betting big on expanding domestic operations; it's not a half-baked strategy anymore. I certainly don't. Intel isn't just hoping to get its home affairs in order; its overseas expansion is also ramping up. In 2024, its long-awaited Fab 34 joint venture in Ireland began ramping up production using the Intel 4 (its first EUV-based node) and Intel 3 process nodes. In Israel, Intel invested around $25 billion to build Fab 38 after a $3.2 billion subsidy from the Israeli government. Poland also greenlit $1.9 billion in state support last year for Intel's new $4.6 billion plant. Even in Germany, Intel plans to invest over $30 billion in two fabs, supported by $10.7 billion in government subsidies under the European Chips Act. These international fabs aren't just for capacity expansion but also geopolitical hedging in an increasingly unpredictable landscape. Although some of these projects have been delayed, the increasing willingness of several countries to subsidize Intel's global expansion shows their commitment to reducing reliance on the likes of TSMC and Samsung. This distributed manufacturing model could help Intel sidestep future supply chain bottlenecks and regional disruptions, like we saw during the pandemic and the recent Taiwan earthquakes. Intel has outlined its new processes for the next few years, but what does it all mean? A big piece of Intel’s pivot is its foundry business — and it’s finally gaining traction. At Intel’s 2024 Foundry Direct Connect event, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had already signed several customers for its upcoming 18A process. The list now includes names like Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Qualcomm, and defense contractors Trusted Semiconductor Solutions and Reliable MicroSystems. Intel had also announced a collaboration with Arm to produce its SoCs using the 18A process node. And most recently, Intel and TSMC agreed to enter into a joint venture whereby the latter would own 20% of Intel's foundry business. This is a huge vote of confidence in Intel's revitalized process roadmap. It signals that customers are at least willing to bet on Intel again. The company's plan to regain process leadership hinges on the success of 18A as well as future nodes such as 14A. Now structured as a subsidiary, Intel's foundry arm could play a huge role in Team Blue's resurgence. Intel might be on its way to becoming a company that doesn't hoard in-house manufacturing, collaborates with rivals, and treats its fabs as a revenue stream instead of just a moat. An unlikely duo. Intel has been pursuing smart capital, distributed manufacturing, and a resurgent foundry business in a bid to regain process leadership and solve its financial woes. Aided by federal grants, international subsidies for global expansion, and collaborations with the biggest names in the business might just prove to be the push Intel needed to regain its lost sheen. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved TSMC has denied any joint venture with any firm recently during their lastest earnings call/conference call. A modern Steam Box sounds more enticing than a handheld refresh, it could be Valve’s next big move.

Title: Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, ... More California on May 6, 2025. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) At about $117 a share, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still trading about 15% below its all-time highs seen in January 2025. Revenues grew more than 110% over the last year, while net profit margins exceeded 50%. With artificial intelligence tunes playing everywhere, do you think Nvidia stock is a good long-term bet at current levels? What about at a 30% discount at about $82 per share? Now we’re talking. So if you think $82 per share for the AI poster-child is a steal, and have some cash ready to go, here’s a clever trade. The Trade: 12% yield at 30% margin of safety, by selling Put Options NVDA stock is trading at about $117. You can sell a long-dated Put option expiring June 18, 2026, with a strike price of $82, and collect roughly $680 in premium per contract (each contract represents 100 shares). That’s about an 8.3% yield on the $8,200 you’re setting aside for the possibility of buying the stock. Plus, don’t forget, this cash parked in a savings or money market account will earn an extra 4%. So we’re talking >12% yield overall. Separately, see Tesla Stock To $1,500 And here’s the kicker. You're agreeing to buy Nvidia at $82, a roughly 30% discount to the current market price, only if the stock drops below that level by the expiration date. Think that’s too risky? Want a higher margin of safety - for example 40%? Use a $70 strike instead of $82 strike - your overall earnings will still be an impressive 9% instead of 12%, and you’ll enjoy more peace. The strategy is reliable because large institutions have tested the strategy at scale, and for the right long-term investors, may serve just right. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Sure, I see the 12% return, however, what if Nvidia drops more than 30%, isn’t there some risk? Of course, there is risk. Because, there are two ways this could unfold: In short, you win either way, especially if you're comfortable owning a quality company like Nvidia for the long haul. Is that a good deal though? It could very well be, if you consider three facts -- If you do end up owning NVDA stock, you’re not stuck with some speculative small-cap stock. You're holding a company that is: And The Risk of a Crash Is Lower Than You Think Selling puts is only as good as the business you’re willing to own. With Nvidia, that bar is high. Here’s why: The Bottom Line - Margin of Safety This trade offers an asymmetric risk-reward setup, with a built-in 30% discount. Either way, you come out ahead. These are the kinds of margin-of-safety setups and asymmetric risk-reward tradeoffs that we seek in the Trefis HQ portfolio, which is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. HAWTHORNE, CALIFORNIA - MAY 2: A Tesla Model S is seen parked at a Tesla Supercharger on May 2, 2025 ... More in Hawthorne, California. (Photo by Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images) Here’s how Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) can reach $1,500, up from $300 currently. Tesla sold 1.7 million cars in 2024. The key ingredient is that Elon Musk is back in the driver’s seat, with his work at the Trump White House apparently winding down. Fully focused. Focused on the original mission: transition the world to electric vehicles and become a market leader. Ten million cars a year. Market leadership has a halo effect. We believe that momentum will provide a strong tailwind for Tesla’s next bets - humanoid robots and robotaxis as well. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. We lay out our upside case for Tesla to $1,500 below, as a counterpoint to our previous analysis that outlined a downside case to $100. Separately, see Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety. So, how does this happen? First, cars. Tesla already has EV leadership. Despite the recent slowdown in EV sales in the U.S., the truth is that people want electric vehicles. Nearly 50% of cars sold in China in 2024 were EVs. This didn’t begin in China - it began in the U.S. Greta Thunberg thundered first in Europe. Then the climate message spread everywhere. People get it. Coal and gas are yesterday. Clean energy is today. The industry just needs its leader back - Musk, level-headed and championing clean energy again. The idea is simple. If China can do it, why can’t America? See Tesla’s lost cause. Once consumers in the U.S. and Europe reconnect with the urgency of the climate mission, and Musk plays a central role in it, it becomes unstoppable. Can Tesla scale to 2.5 million cars this year and 3 million in 2026? Musk has done it before, going from 500,000 to 1.8 million cars in just three years. He can do it again. On the upside, we estimate that Tesla delivers 5 million vehicles by 2027, and 10 million by 2030. At an average price of $40,000 per vehicle and a conservative 20% net margin, that’s $80 billion in profit. At a 25x multiple, that’s a $2 trillion valuation for the automotive business alone. Tesla has other major projects that could drive valuation. The robotaxi launch in Austin, expected around June, could kick off an enormous new business. To be sure, Tesla will be playing catch-up with Google's Waymo, which has offered autonomous rides in several cities for almost five years now. Can Waymo 3x Google stock? But Tesla controls the whole stack - it builds the EVs, develops the software, and also operates the charging network. It also has a large base of vehicles on the road that can be brought on board its robotaxi fleet. That’s a real edge. The ride-hailing market is already huge. Uber handled over 230 million rides per week in Q4 2024 alone. At roughly $30 per ride, that’s a $375 billion annual revenue pool. And that’s just human-driven rides. Autonomous could be bigger still. Waymo retains users better than Uber or Lyft and reports much fewer crashes than the U.S. average. Now for every person hailing a ride, ten still drive themselves. That could change quickly once people start seeing others relaxing in the back seat, watching Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel. The roughly $375 billion market could double. A $750 billion autonomous ride-hailing market isn’t far-fetched. Now, suppose Tesla captures a third of that - $250 billion in annual revenue. At a 25% net margin, that’s almost $63 billion in profit. Apply a 30x multiple, and you get $1.9 trillion in value for ride-hailing alone. Tesla is also working on humanoid robots called Optimus. The company says the robots are designed to carry out dangerous, boring, or repetitive tasks. Musk believes Optimus could eventually be Tesla’s most valuable business - and with good reason. Global labor shortages, rising wages, and soaring demand for automation all make the case for physical AI compelling. Optimus is hardly a moonshot. It’s the next logical step for a company that already builds advanced robots to manufacture its cars. And Tesla’s cars themselves are among the most sophisticated robots on wheels. Musk has said Tesla will build 10,000 Optimus units in 2025, with “several thousand” doing useful work by year-end. With a global labor force of over 3.5 billion people, even a fraction of that market could be transformative. In our upside case, Tesla might build 10 million Optimus units per year, priced at $20,000 each with 20% net margins - that’s $40 billion in annual profit. At a 30x multiple, that implies a $1.2 trillion business. Add it all up, and a $5 trillion valuation for Tesla starts to look plausible. That translates to a stock price of over $1,500 per share. What about a timeline for this? Building this sort of scale can take some time. Investors will need to look well into the future. Think 2030 or maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Tesla has the technology and scale, and is addressing a potentially massive market. With Musk back in the driver's seat, this high valuation is within reach. While Tesla is advancing transformative technologies, Trefis HQ portfolio is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ‘Paying Far More Attention’: Rubio Turns His Gaze To America’s Backyard After Years Of Neglect From Washington

Time Published: 2025-05-10T14:07:12Z
Full Content:
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has wasted no time in reshaping a decades-long foreign policy approach that’s paid “scarce attention” to America’s backyard and opened the door to China as a result. Rubio, whose interest in Latin America was a key talking point in his nomination to his role in the State Department, made a blitz of visits and diplomatic actions to various nations in the region to secure American interests early during the administration, most recently extracting Venezuelan opposition members to the U.S. from the regime’s grasp. As the Trump administration turns its attention to issues like immigration, fentanyl trafficking and curtailing Chinese influence globally, Rubio has become one of Trump’s key liaisons in the region. “Rubio is paying far more attention to our hemisphere than previous Secretary of State’s already with just the number of visits to the region,” Andres Martinez Fernandez, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Particularly under the Biden administration, very little scarce attention to our hemisphere. I think it was really a dangerously low level of engagement.” (RELATED: ‘Playing Offense In Our Backyard’: With Biden’s Eyes Elsewhere, China Slowly Breaks US’ Grip Over Latin America) US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives at Juan Santamaria International Airport near San Jose, Costa Rica on February 4, 2025. (Photo by MARK SCHIEFELBEIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) During his visit to Panama, Rubio spoke with Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino to emphasize that China’s influence in the Panama Canal was unacceptable, saying the U.S. would be ready to respond if the status quo did not change. China has significant influence in the Panama Canal, owning two ports on either side of the critical seaway. American investment firm Blackrock had planned to buy the ports off of China for $23 billion, but the deal has since been delayed due to Chinese hesitance and Panamanian scrutiny. Additionally, China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. Panama, in response to Rubio and the Trump administration’s pressure, gave U.S. warships the ability to travel “first and free” through the canal while increasing U.S. troop presence in its many military installations in the nation. “For decades, out of all the regions in the world, our own region has received the least consistent attention from U.S. policymakers,” Rubio wrote in an April 2024 column for The National Interest. “This cannot continue if we want security, prosperity, and freedom to win out in the Western Hemisphere.” Further down south from Panama, Rubio and the Trump administration have applied pressure on the socialist state of Venezuela. Rubio oversaw the rescue of five Venezuelan opposition members that were trapped in the Argentine Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, after the government charged them with conspiring against President Nicolas Maduro. The five persons had close ties with opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who supported former presidential candidate Edmundo González in the 2024 election. The election was highly controversial due to the government’s denial of the results and the subsequent persecution of González, who fled to Spain to escape Maduro’s influence. Rubio openly called the Maduro regime “illegitimate” after the rescue, saying the dictator’s actions have “undermined Venezuela’s institutions, violated human rights, and endangered our regional security.” “I think what Secretary Rubio is doing with President Trump is placing pressure on the regime while engaging collectively in efforts to protect Americans, secure American interests and isolate the capacity of the regime to disrupt U.S. security,” Fernandez told the DCNF. “It’s a tough situation, and there’s some major challenges for us.” Rubio has also moved to solidify America’s ties with Caribbean nations and sound the alarm over Cuba’s human rights abuses. Additionally, China has reportedly set up at least four spy bases in the communist island nation, some of which are equipped with signal intelligence equipment used to intercept communications from a target location. The secretary met with the heads of state of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Prime Saint Lucia, Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis to discuss continued partnership while singling out Cuba as a target of further containment in early May. Some observers have compared Rubio’s posture in Latin America to the Monroe Doctrine, first coined during the presidency of James Monroe, which emphasized American domination of the Western Hemisphere and the exclusion of Europe from the region. Now, as America deals with a novel foe in China, Fernandez thinks the comparison is fair, but with key differences in the modern world. “If the goal is to protect and assert U.S. interests within our own hemisphere, that at the end of the day, that’s the core of the Monroe Doctrine,” Fernandez told the DCNF. Illegal immigration has become a key focal point of the administration’s diplomatic outreach in the region, such as cooperating with El Salvador to house deported criminal migrants in the maximum security CECOT prison. Rubio met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in February to solidify agreements to help stem the illegal immigration crisis. “Secretary Rubio knows first-hand the important role our region plays in the America First foreign policy agenda,” a senior State Department official told the DCNF. “He was intentional in his selection to visit many countries in our hemisphere during his first international trip.” “Whether it be working with regional allies to deter illegal immigration, designating cartels and gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or holding tyrannical regimes accountable, Secretary Rubio remains focused on making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous,” the official added.

Wells Fargo is updating its outlook on Uber (UBER), reportedly forecasting an explosive share price for the $173 billion ride-hailing company. In a new note to clients, Wells Fargo’s Ken Gawrelski and other analysts raise Uber’s price target to $100 from $90 and reiterate an overweight rating, reports Barron’s. The analysts also say Uber’s share price may rise to as high as $126, a more than 52% increase from the stock’s $82.81 close on Friday, as competition is likely to drive company efficiencies. “We believe the stock is likely to outperform as healthy fundamental trends drive upward estimate revisions.” The update comes after Uber’s reported earnings for the first quarter topped analysts’ estimates with earnings per share of $0.83, soaring above the $0.51 consensus forecast. The company also printed $11.5 billion in revenue in Q1, a 14% growth on a year-over-year basis. However, the company fell short of the anticipated revenue of $11.6 billion in the first quarter of the year. One highlight reported was that users booked more than three billion “trips,” up 18% from the first quarter of 2024. The Wells Fargo team notes that top-line trends remain strong for both Uber’s mobility and delivery segments. They also say that Uber’s deployment of autonomous vehicles in the near term should attract more investor interest.

Title: Companies are going hardcore. It means one classic piece of career advice is getting more crucial.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/career-advice-documenting-success-wins-promotions-job-security-layoffs-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-10T08:04:01Z
Full Content:
A few big companies have been in the news for cutting underperformers and rewarding high performers. If you're looking to advance your career or keep your job in an increasingly frozen job market, you should take advantage of the classic advice to document your work wins and accomplishments. Keeping track of your performance can be crucial to getting a raise or a promotion, and for job security. Microsoft and Meta have made performance-related job cuts. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported that "Amazon is revising its compensation structure within pay bands to better recognize and reward long-term high performers." Emily Field, a partner in McKinsey & Company's people and organizational performance practice, said performance management tends to follow economic and talent cycles. Companies were more relaxed about it during the pandemic and the Great Resignation, when workers were quitting their jobs en masse. But now the Great Resignation is over, hiring has cooled, layoffs are still low, and more workers are staying put. That more static labor market could mean demonstrating your value at work can be even more important to get promoted or to try to protect your role from layoffs. "What we're seeing is, particularly with AI, particularly with economic headwinds, we're seeing organizations say, we need to focus on high performance to be able to win, to be able to innovate, to be able to beat our competitors, and therefore we need to focus on performance management," Field said. Below is advice on how to document your wins, who needs to see them, and how often you should be discussing performance. Amy Lentz, the founder of Hack Your HR and chief people officer of footwear company Toms, said, "If you are creating value in your job, I think it's important to document," Lentz said. "Where people get kind of hung up is, 'Well, what is success and how do I measure it?'" Vicki Salemi, a career expert for Monster, said if a company is figuring out layoffs and their budget, workers need to also think of their job in terms of numbers. "They're thinking about in terms of your wins, but also money saved, time saved as well as money earned, time earned in terms of efficiencies, streamlining," Salemi said. Field said it's always been important to have quantifiable metrics. But in today's economy, "it's even more important to be able to say, this is how I'm contributing to the organization's success." Salemi said not all companies have quantitative performance ratings because they are having ongoing conversations about performance and don't think there needs to be a formal process. "In that case, it may be harder for you to show that you're a strong performer if they don't go by metrics," she said. Salemi said to focus on what you can do to be a good employee, including whether you are hitting or exceeding goals and expectations. If you are worried about layoffs, Salemi said to ask your boss what you need to do differently or what you need to prioritize. "That shows engagement, that shows that you care, and that you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work and hopefully get honest, helpful feedback," Salemi said. "Your boss might say, 'It's the company. It's not you.'" Lentz said documented wins should be measurable, objective, and factual, and less about your perception of that success. She said to document what you did, the outcome, and how it brought value. Salemi said to get in the habit of quantifying what you do because this can also be helpful if you apply for a new job. Salemi added that you can also document work testimonials and feedback you have received. Salemi suggested workers document their success in real time, even if it's just a note on their phones that they can refer back to. However, she advised against showing them to your boss after every success. "You do need to do that periodically and when it matters," Salemi said, adding that a good time to do so is during your organization's review of salaries, after a big project, or overcoming some work hurdles. Lentz suggested making a document that you can add to and share with your boss, arguing that it could be more effective than just tracking everything in a single annual review. Field said setting goals is important for documenting successes. She said to have check-ins with your manager because your priorities and what you need to deliver on might change over time. Lentz suggested asking in your one-on-one meeting with your boss for a conversation in the next few months about goals and how to spend your time, so you can understand if you are working on what is of value at the company. Salemi suggested asking your boss if they have a minute to discuss how to be rated as exceptional at the company this year and what metrics they need to see from you. Salemi said even if your boss isn't numbers-focused, you need to include figures in your documentation because your manager won't be the only one evaluating your performance. She added that it can also be important if you are considering an internal job switch. "The first thing that potential new boss is going to do is they'll want to see your performance review," Salemi said. "It's important to highlight your wins and that means including numbers."

Title: Marx wasn't entirely wrong on the lay of capitalism; he was just early

Full Content:
Karl Marx described a world of two main classes: those who owned the means of production (the bourgeoisie), and those who sold their labor to survive (the proletariat). His vision reflected the industrial world of the 19th century—factories, landlords, and mass labor. Today, we live in a world of startups, social media, and digital nomads. It might seem like 'class' is obsolete. But when we peel back the layers, we find that class, as he saw it, never disappeared — it just changed form. So what counts as ownership today? In Marx's time, ownership meant factories, land, and physical infrastructure. Today, it's code, platforms, patents, and data. The owners are no longer factory tycoons; they are tech moguls. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta don't just sell products — they own the channels through which digital life flows. These platforms are the modern means of production. If you want to reach customers, communicate, work, or learn, you often do it through their systems. This control gives them immense leverage. They extract fees, set rules, harvest data, and shape behavior — not just through economics, but through algorithmic influence. They don't just benefit from the market — they define it. It’s true that anyone can start a business today. Anyone can code, freelance, or build an audience. And some people do rise: Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others began with modest means and built empires. But these are rare stories. Most founders fail. Most people lack the capital, networks, and insulation to survive repeated failure. Success often comes not from a single stroke of genius but from persistence, timing, and the ability to fail safely. In other words, the field may appear open, but it isn’t level. A few make it. Many don’t. And even among those who “succeed,” control often passes to the investors and platform owners behind the curtain. The modern ladder still exists — but it’s taller, slipperier, and guarded by gatekeepers with venture capital. If Marx's class model still applies, how do we translate it to today? The bourgeoisie are now the platform owners: the founders, VCs, and institutional investors who control the infrastructure. The petty bourgeoisie are creators, startup founders, and engineers with some equity. They have partial control, but they’re vulnerable to policy shifts and market forces. The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass—spam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they’re governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn’t disappeared — it’s been digitized. The so-called “tech middle class” is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don’t control. A change in TikTok’s algorithm, YouTube’s payout structure, or Apple’s App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old — shopkeepers, artisans, and traders — they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx’s time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality — though now dressed in tech jargon — is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We’re no longer marching on factory floors. We’re negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right? Perhaps on his initial analysis. He couldn’t foresee the internet, social media, or SaaS. But he understood something timeless: when a small group owns the tools of production—whether they’re factories or platforms — they will shape the world in their favor. No, we don’t need to embrace communism to admit this. But we should be honest about how capitalism concentrates power. And if we value real opportunity, we should focus less on hustle culture and more on who owns the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Class isn’t about who’s rich and who’s not. It’s about who controls the systems. Most of us still don’t. Until we do, Marx isn’t irrelevant — he’s just updated. Thien Ooi is an engineer who works in the tech field.

The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass—spam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they’re governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn’t disappeared — it’s been digitized. The so-called “tech middle class” is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don’t control. A change in TikTok’s algorithm, YouTube’s payout structure, or Apple’s App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old — shopkeepers, artisans, and traders — they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx’s time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality — though now dressed in tech jargon — is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We’re no longer marching on factory floors. We’re negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right? Perhaps on his initial analysis. He couldn’t foresee the internet, social media, or SaaS. But he understood something timeless: when a small group owns the tools of production—whether they’re factories or platforms — they will shape the world in their favor. No, we don’t need to embrace communism to admit this. But we should be honest about how capitalism concentrates power. And if we value real opportunity, we should focus less on hustle culture and more on who owns the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Class isn’t about who’s rich and who’s not. It’s about who controls the systems. Most of us still don’t. Until we do, Marx isn’t irrelevant — he’s just updated. Thien Ooi is an engineer who works in the tech field.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100K – So why are BTC ETF inflows suddenly slowing down?

Inflows are back but, why do they feel weaker than before? Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark has reignited excitement across the crypto landscape, with spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs riding the wave of optimism. These U.S.-listed funds, which had recently faced outflows amid tariff-related uncertainty, have swiftly rebounded, attracting significant institutional capital. In just the past two days, i.e., the 7th and the 8th of May, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a combined $260 million, reflecting renewed investor confidence. While the aggressive pace of inflows appears to be leveling off, the sustained demand signals that institutional appetite remains strong as Bitcoin continues to test new highs. However, while Bitcoin has now breached the $100K milestone, the recent ETF inflows haven’t quite matched the intensity seen during previous market recoveries. Back when BTC was still below $100K, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows surge as high as $917 million in response to tariff-related rebounds. In contrast, the most recent data from Farside Investors shows more modest figures: $142.3 million and $117.4 million in inflows on the 7th and the 8th of May, respectively. What stands out, however, is not just the volume but the evolving behavior of major institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity, suggesting a potential shift in strategic positioning. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has consistently dominated daily inflow charts, appears to be losing some steam. After recording a staggering $643.2 million in inflows on the 23rd of April, recent figures show a sharp cooldown, with daily contributions slipping to the $30–70 million range. Analysts suggest this slowdown could reflect a recalibration of investment strategies or signal the end of BlackRock’s initial accumulation phase. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) is showing renewed strength, garnering over $75 million in inflows across just two days. This rebound could help Fidelity reclaim ground in the competitive Bitcoin ETF arena, especially after a week of net outflows. Now, while Bitcoin ETFs continue to draw investor attention, Ethereum [ETH] funds are facing a different reality. On the 8th of May, Ether ETFs recorded outflows for the third consecutive day, with $16.1 million exiting the market, all from BlackRock’s ETHA, while the remaining eight Ether funds saw no activity. Interestingly, Fidelity, though not leading the ETH ETF charge, has taken a strategic leap by advancing into new territory. Its spot Solana [SOL] ETF filing has now been formally recognized by the U.S. SEC, signaling its broader ambition in the digital asset arena. While toppling BlackRock’s dominance won’t be easy, Fidelity’s expanding footprint suggests it’s gearing up for a more aggressive presence in the evolving crypto ETF landscape.

Title: BlackRock expands quantum risk disclosure in amended Bitcoin ETF filing

Share this article BlackRock has updated its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) prospectus with expanded language on the potential risks posed by quantum computing, adding a detailed discussion to what was previously a brief mention of the technology. The amended prospectus, filed on May 9, includes extensive details about how quantum computing advances could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. The filing notes that advances in quantum computing technology could undermine the viability of many cryptographic algorithms used globally, including those used to secure digital assets like Bitcoin. “If quantum computing is able to advance in that way, there is a risk that quantum computing could result in the cryptography underlying the Bitcoin network becoming ineffective, which, if realized, could compromise the security of the Bitcoin network, or allow a malicious actor to compromise the wallets holding bitcoin owned by the Trust or others on the Bitcoin network, which would result in losses to Shareholders,” the filing reads. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who first reported the changes, noted that such disclosures are routine in SEC filings. “These are just basic risk disclosures. They are going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset that’s being invested in. It’s completely standard,” Seyffart said. The filing notes that while the Bitcoin community is working on quantum-resistant solutions, “there is no guarantee that new quantum-proof architectures will be built and appropriate transitions will be implemented across the network at scale in a timely manner.” BlackRock on Friday also filed an amendment to its iShares Ethereum Trust, adding provisions for in-kind creation/redemption. The filings surfaced after the firm met with SEC staff to discuss implementing staking and parameters for options trading on crypto ETFs. There has been ongoing back-and-forth discussion surrounding quantum computing and how it could pose a risk to Bitcoin’s security. Concerns spiked last December when Google unveiled Willow, its next-generation quantum chip. The company claimed Willow would solve certain computational tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken the world’s most powerful classical supercomputer 10 septillion years. Just a few months later, Microsoft announced its own milestone: a quantum chip called Majorana 1, which it said addresses key scalability challenges that have long held the technology back. These developments have reignited fears in the crypto space about how fast quantum computing is advancing, and whether it could soon threaten the cryptographic foundations that secure Bitcoin and other digital assets. Many in the community voiced immediate concern that increasingly powerful quantum machines might one day crack the encryption protecting older Bitcoin wallets and even modern exchanges. Despite rapid progress, most experts agree that quantum computers aren’t yet powerful or stable enough to pose a real threat to Bitcoin in the short term. For now, these breakthroughs are more theoretical than practical when it comes to breaking public-key cryptography at scale. Still, the industry isn’t waiting around. Many projects are already exploring or implementing quantum-resistant technologies, anticipating the eventual arrival of a “quantum-safe” future. Interestingly, quantum computing may not just pose risks. It could also enhance blockchain security. Last month, researchers from JPMorgan, Quantinuum, and other groups successfully used a quantum computer to generate certifiably random numbers—a breakthrough that could strengthen encryption, improve digital signatures, and make future blockchain systems even more secure.

Title: Platforms, Private Credit Fund and Banks’ Fortunes Are Increasingly Intertwined
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2025/platforms-private-credit-fund-and-banks-fortunes-are-increasingly-intertwined/

Highlights Bank exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), including private equity (PE) and private credit (PC) funds, has increased significantly. The Fed estimates that large banks’ total loan commitments to PE/PC funds rose from less than $10 billion in 2013 to approximately $300 billion by the end of 2023. The financial system is becoming increasingly interwoven, connecting banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and end customers, increasing banks’ credit and liquidity risks. Private credit exists as an essential part of the capital spectrum, especially for firms that cannot get, or choose not to get, traditional bank channels. The private credit firms — including venture capital companies, buyout funds, hedge funds, direct lenders and others — are in turn significant partners for FinTech platforms that, themselves, extend loans. The capital flows that connect banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and the latter’s end customers is increasingly interwoven, with risks and rewards extending across that continuum. In a report by the Boston Fed, research shows that banks have been increasing their exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), a category that includes private equity (PE) and private credit (PC). The data shows that large banks’ total loan commitments to PE/PC funds are approximately $300 billion, or 14% of large banks’ total lending to NBFIs, as of the end of 2023. The tally was less than $10 billion in 2013. The central bank contends that “understanding the scale and complexity of bank-NBFI connections is important for identifying potential risks to financial stability — that is, the financial system’s ability to continue supplying capital to the economy if strained by shocks.” The PE and PC firms, in turn, put money to work in the economy. But, as the Fed report details, when these firms are hit by shocks, “they tend to draw down their bank lines of credit at a faster rate than firms with only bank credit. This creates a channel through which PC funds may increase banks’ credit and liquidity risks, on balance.” In recent months, PYMNTS has reported on the opportunities and growth industries funded by private credit. AI has been a particular area of increased investment, representing a $1.8 trillion market for funding to help build out data centers and other infrastructure. And in general, banks such as JPMorgan have been ramping up their own efforts to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, to increase private credit transactions. HSBC has reportedly been mulling making inroads into the private credit. Within FinTech, last year, for example, SumUp, a U.K. FinTech focused on POS hardware and issuing services, garnered a $1.6 billion loan provided by lenders including Goldman Sachs Asset Management, BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Vista Credit Partners. Earnings results have also underscored the presence of private, institutional investors on platforms, buying loans extended by those digital lenders. Upstart, in one example, has detailed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that “out of the total principal of loans transacted on our marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2025, 60% were purchased by institutional investors.” Personal loans originated in the most recent quarter stood at $2 billion. Earlier this week, Upstart signed a capital arrangement with Fortress, where the private credit firm is purchasing up to $1.2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform. As for the state of these arrangements, Upstart CFO Sanjay Datta said on the call that “these committed partnerships are frankly behaving exactly as designed. The basis of these partnerships was that we essentially committed to navigating the different parts of the macro cycle together … We believe we have the tools to read and react to shifts in the credit risk environment very quickly on behalf of the partners.” The securitization markets are functioning well, the executive said on the call. Upstart CEO Dave Girouard said on that same call that “we’ve had no pullbacks from our private credit … committed capital partners, and we likewise had no pullbacks from banks or credit unions … our credit continues to perform.” LendingClub, in its own earnings report, said that its structured certificates are a “preferred structure for private credit” and represented 29% of the nearly $2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform in the first quarter. Drew LaBenne, CFO of LendingClub, told analysts on the conference call that “the opportunity is massive in the insurance market. And if you think about a lot of the transactions that we’re doing today with asset managers and private credit, a big pool of the money that they’re managing is insurance money.” The Fed paper states: “Private funds may be growing more reliant on bank loans, both by taking larger loan commitments relative to fund assets and by utilizing a higher percentage of those loan commitments.” The read across here is that the interconnectedness, and the leverage, bear watching in an environment where things are functioning well but where the clouds of macro volatility can gather at a moment’s notice.

Title: Genocide, Blood, and Dividends

By Adam Sharp PostedMay 9, 2025 In the 1987 film Wall Street, Michael Douglas famously played Gordon Gekko, a cutthroat corporate raider. But compared to the Dutch pioneers who founded the world’s first publicly-traded company, Gordon Gekko was a softie. Those Dutch guys were literally cutting throats in pursuit of profit. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in Amsterdam in 1602. Over the century the VOC would dominate trade with Asia, wage multiple wars, commit genocide, and build monopolies. Oh yeah, along the way they sold gobs of spices, silks, and opium. But before all of that could happen, the VOC’s founders needed to raise money. So in 1602 the Dutch East India Company conducted the first initial public offering (IPO), giving all Dutchmen the chance to invest in this new venture. VOC Co-Founder Dirck Van Os | Source: Wikipedia The VOC IPO was unique because it was open to anyone, not just wealthy merchants and royalty. In total, 1,143 investors participated. Co-founder Dirck Van Os’ maid, Neeltgen Cornelis, was the second-to-last investor on the registry, having subscribed 100 guilders, which was likely her life’s savings. If Mrs. Cornelis the maid held onto her shares for the long run, she did quite well. In some years, VOC investors received a dividend equivalent to 75% of the capital they initially committed. Now, that dividend occasionally came in the form of spices (cloves and mace in particular). But hey, profit is profit… Dutch historian Lodewijk Petram has calculated the return of VOC shares (with dividends reinvested), and from its founding in 1602 through 1698, each 100 guilders invested turned into about 65,000. Source: The World’s First Stock Exchange VOC shares were groundbreaking because they were tradable on what would become the world’s first stock exchange. In addition, the Dutch East India Company introduced the concept of limited liability for shareholders. In other words, investors could only lose the amount they invested. They wouldn’t be responsible for the company’s debts or losses if the venture failed. The VOC set a new standard for how companies could raise capital and distribute profits. But the business model was downright diabolical… The VOC quickly became a publicly-traded empire. By 1637 it was worth the equivalent of around $6.9 trillion in today’s money. That’s double the value of the largest modern companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The Dutch East India Company maintained its own navy with around 40 warships and 200 trading vessels at any given time. It fought wars against Spain, Portugal, Britain, and various Asian powers. These great powers clashed over lucrative trade routes and assets in Asia. They fought over territories such as the Spice Islands and the Philippines, and sold opium to China. In one notorious incident, the VOC invaded the Banda Islands, the world’s only source of nutmeg and mace at the time. Back then these spices were more valuable than gold. Using mercenaries which included Japanese samurai, VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen brutally massacred the Bandanese, publicly executing its leaders. Of around 15,000 natives, only a few hundred are believed to have survived. The VOC brought in slaves and other workers to take over Banda’s nutmeg and mace operations. These newly-acquired plantations were wildly profitable for shareholders. The company now had a total monopoly on two of the most valuable spices, which they sold into European markets at 1,000% markups. The Dutch East India Company was basically a publicly-traded evil empire. But for many years it did succeed in its mission of rewarding shareholders. Over time, however, the company lost its monopoly on spices and trade with Asia. Nutmeg and mace were smuggled out of Banda and cultivated elsewhere. Eventually the price of these once-rare goods collapsed. Artificial monopolies can only last so long. The VOC became increasingly corrupt and bureaucratic. It took on too much debt, and in time it essentially became a ponzi scheme. Ever-increasing debt loads were required to pay dividends. That’s a classic sign of the end approaching. The British East India Company eventually became a fierce competitor and seized many of the VOC’s prime territories. In 1799 the Dutch government dissolved the VOC and absorbed its assets and debts. The company had lasted almost 200 years. Despite the evil deeds committed by the Dutch East India Company, the firm played a critical role in the history of finance. It set a new standard for how companies could raise money and distribute profits to shareholders. Without the VOC, we might not have today’s efficient and lucrative stock markets.

This week: Bitcoin miners wrangle with malaise, Coinbase tries a little misdirection ahead of its earnings miss, and sources say Meta is stablecoin curious. Bitcoin miners’ malaise Publicly traded Bitcoin miners have faced some dark days this week. Stocking up on BTC wasn’t enough to help MARA Holdings, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MARA ticker, outrun a lousy quarterly report on Thursday. Remember that at the end of March 31, when Bitcoin was trading for around $83,000, the company announced a $2 billion stock offering to raise cash for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” And the company has been no stranger to acquiring Bitcoin on the open market. Whatever gains the company might realize on BTC purchases with its latest offering will be fodder for Q2 earnings. The company posted a $533 million Q1 loss yesterday, largely due to having to adjust the valuation of Bitcoin that’s on its balance sheet. But here’s the really troubling detail: Mining output fell 19% even though the Florida company has now doubled its capacity since the 2024 Bitcoin network’s halving. A quick refresher: The Bitcoin network has now undergone four halving events, which reduce the reward paid to Bitcoin miners by half. Last year’s event saw the reward drop to 3.125 BTC. But that doesn’t mean investors are racing for the doors. MARA opened Friday trading for $15.16, 6% higher than yesterday’s close. And while MARA bought Bitcoin in Q1, its rival Riot Platforms outsold all other publicly traded miners by unloading 475 Bitcoin in April, worth $38.8 million at the time. Time to moth ball the mining rigs? Nah, not all of them, according to investment bank Benchmark. On Tuesday, the bank’s analysts set a 5x price target of $3 and buy rating for Canaan, which trades on Nasdaq under the CAN ticker. Equity research analyst Mark Palmer is betting that Canaan’s North American expansion will help its stock rise. But a few hours before the closing bell Friday, it was down 5.87% for the week and trading for $0.75. Deja Vu for Meta There might be a new company in the Public Keys cohort soon. Meta, which trades on the Nasdaq under the META ticker, doesn’t want to say anything about it on the record, but five unnamed sources told Fortune that the Facebook parent company is exploring the idea of using stablecoins to reward content creators on its platforms. One of the crypto execs who spoke with the magazine posited that Meta subsidiary Instagram could use stablecoins to pay lower fees on small payments of $100 or less to content creators. Execs who spilled the deets to Fortune were careful to say the company is very much in the exploratory phase and that implementation could be a ways off. If this sounds familiar, it’s because the company tried to roll out its own stablecoin, Diem, in 2019. But it got a slap on the wrist from regulators and abandoned the project in 2022 by selling the assets to now-defunct crypto-friendly bank Silvergate. But shareholders might want to see Meta drop one of its lagging experiments before it picks up a new one. Analysts have been calling for the company to abandon its Reality Labs project, which is responsible for the Quest VR headset, augmented reality sunglasses, and the Horizon Worlds metaverse game. Forrester analyst Mike Proulx has called Reality Labs a “leaky bucket” after the company’s Q1 earnings report revealed the division had lost $4.2 billion in Q1, bringing its cumulative losses to $60 billion. Coinbase misses on revenue—look over there! Maybe it’s just us, but splashy announcements ahead of earnings usually mean there’s been less than stellar performance for the quarter. At least, that was the case for Coinbase this week. On Wednesday, the company released the spoils of its FOIA request to get public records from the SEC, FDIC and other agencies on their investigations into Ethereum and efforts to debank crypto firms. Then, on Thursday, the company started the day touting its nearly $3 billion acquisition of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit. But the company's after market earnings report showed that it saw a big slowdown in retail trading volume. It’s not entirely surprising. Global markets have been at the mercy of fractious trade negotiations—or lack thereof—for months. CEO Brian Armstrong said he still wants to see USDC become the largest U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin within a couple years. It’s not just for bragging rights, either. USDC is still a huge money maker for Coinbase. The exchange’s deal with Circle, which evenly splits interest earned on the cash backing USDC tokens, is “indefinitely renewable,” CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company’s earnings call Thursday. “Increased USDC balances on our platform result in durable revenue for Coinbase. Base stablecoin balances reached $4 billion in Q1, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. This was also largely driven by USDC,” he added.

The meeting followed another encounter on April 1 where BlackRock also discussed staking and ETP rules, but now added tokenization. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

BlackRock representatives met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force on May 9 to seek guidance on a range of crypto regulatory issues, including tokenization, staking, and approval frameworks for exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to the meeting memo, BlackRock reviewed its digital asset offerings, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the proposed iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The firm used the opportunity to solicit input on how current and future products might be regulated under federal securities laws, particularly as the digital asset market matures. The meeting included senior representatives from regulatory affairs, legal, digital assets, and ETF markets. Following a prior session on April 1, BlackRock continues directly engaging with the SEC on crypto policy matters. Last month, the firm discussed technical elements of in-kind redemptions for crypto ETPs and shared a detailed document on existing workflows under the current cash model. Additionally, the firm outlined how those systems might adapt to support alternative models for crypto-based funds. BlackRock also outlined its views on incorporating staking features into ETPs, aligning with other recent industry proposals reviewed by the SEC. Staking has become a central issue in ongoing discussions over whether proof-of-stake asset exposure within ETPs can be designed to meet regulatory expectations without compromising liquidity or investor protections. The meeting also addressed tokenization, with BlackRock requesting feedback on how tokenization efforts could be structured within the existing securities framework. Tokenization is the process of representing traditional assets in the blockchain as digital tokens. The firm also suggested interim standards for crypto ETP issuers, asking the SEC to consider codified guidance that might apply ahead of broader rulemaking. BlackRock additionally discussed criteria under Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act that could be used to evaluate whether a crypto ETP satisfies regulatory thresholds for exchange listing. These criteria include assessments of market integrity and investor safeguards. Lastly, the meeting with the SEC Crypto Task Force covered options on crypto ETPs, with BlackRock raising technical questions about position and exercise limits. The firm requested clarity on how such limits could be structured regarding liquidity thresholds for the underlying crypto or ETP shares.

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? When you don’t have enough money to pay the bills, it can make for a lot of sleepless nights. If you are in that position right now, I want you to know that you are definitely not alone. I have heard from so many people that are being absolutely crushed by our ongoing cost of living crisis that seems to have no end in sight. Just about everything has become substantially more expensive over the past five years, and now the global trade war threatens to push prices for foreign-made goods into the stratosphere. What we are experiencing at this moment is not even close to normal. According to a new survey that was just released, financial stress is at an all-time high for 70 percent of Americans… Americans are drowning in money worries, and it’s taking a serious toll on their mental health. A new survey reveals that 70% of Americans say their financial stress has hit an all-time high, with more than three-quarters feeling totally alone in their struggle to manage money pressures. Even worse, this financial strain is affecting people’s overall well-being, with 20% reporting worse mental health over the past year. The findings come from a nationwide poll of 2,000 people conducted by Talker Research for Doctor On Demand by Included Health, offering a troubling glimpse into how economic pressures are reshaping Americans’ relationship with both mental and physical health. If 70 percent of your population is more financially stressed than they have ever been before, you have a national crisis on your hands. Nobody can argue with that. The wealthiest 10 percent of the country is doing just fine, but almost everyone else is really struggling right now. Unfortunately, the cost of living crisis is about to go to an entirely new level. According to CNBC, the very first container ships from China that are subject to the 145 percent tariff rate that was recently introduced are now arriving at U.S. ports… The first shipping containers carrying Chinese products that are subject to President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs have begun arriving in U.S. ports. Seven ships carrying upward of 12,000 containers that sailed from China after those tariffs took effect have arrived at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, in California. Five more such ships are scheduled to arrive there in coming days. Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, Ralph Lauren and Tractor Supply are among the companies with Chinese goods in these containers, spanning a wide range of consumer items. The next time you walk into Walmart, Target or Home Depot, you may be shocked at the price hikes that you are seeing. The good news is that the U.S. and China will be talking this weekend. Let us hope those negotiations go well. On Truth Social, President Trump just suggested that negotiations could potentially lead to a final tariff rate of 80 percent on Chinese goods… President Donald Trump on Friday set negotiating terms for his administration’s first discussions with China, which are set to take place in Geneva this weekend. In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump appeared to lay out his demands — and concessions — for the meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts. Trump said China must import more US goods, and in return, he believes the United States should lower its 145% tariff on most Chinese goods to 80%. Other government sources are indicating that we could see the tariff rate on Chinese goods lowered to about 50 percent… Specifically, US officials are discussing a proposal to lower President Trump’s punishing levy on China goods to between 50% and 54% as they begin what promise to be lengthy talks to hammer out a trade agreement, sources close to the negotiations said. Meanwhile, trade taxes on neighboring south Asian countries would be cut to 25%, the source added. “They are going to be bringing it down to 50% while the negotiations are ongoing,” the source said of the trade tax on China. Personally, I don’t think that the Chinese will agree to any deal that includes a very high tariff rate on Chinese-made products. But for a moment let’s assume that the Trump administration actually gets what they want. Even a tariff rate of 50 percent would still essentially kill most trade with China. The Chinese economy would be severely damaged, and so would the U.S. economy. We should have never allowed our economy to become so interconnected with the Chinese economy. Now that we have, we find ourselves in a very precarious position. A 145 percent tariff rate on Chinese goods is suicidal, because we deeply depend on thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China. If we can at least get some temporary tariff relief, that will be a positive sign that we desperately need, because right now orders from China are being canceled “very, very fast”… Ahead of the talks, shipments from Chinese ports have slowed. US importers have begun to weigh whether they can afford to do business now that each shipment is subject to the 145% tariff. “It has gone very fast, so this is the result of customers reacting very, very fast on canceling orders or stopping orders and waiting to see if this is going to resolve itself,” Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc said on his company’s first-quarter earnings call. If a deal with China cannot be reached, prices will go up. In fact, we are already starting to see this happen all over the nation. In addition, we will also see widespread layoffs. Earlier today, we learned that Panasonic is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 workers… Electronics maker Panasonic Holdings is cutting 10,000 jobs from its workforce. The Japan-based company announced the job cuts on Friday as part of a broader effort to increase its profitability moving forward. Of the 10,000 employees slated to lose their jobs, half will be workers in Japan, according to Panasonic. The other 5,000 will be in other countries. On top of everything else, we will experience painful shortages of many items if a deal with China cannot be reached. Our society would not be able to handle widespread shortages very well. Even now, we are seeing a lot of desperation, panic and lawlessness in our society. For example, CNBC is reporting that cargo theft is absolutely soaring all over America… America’s supply chain is under attack. From coast to coast, organized criminal groups are hitting trucks on the road, breaking into warehouses and pilfering expensive items from train cars, according to industry experts and law enforcement officials CNBC interviewed during a six-month investigation. It’s all part of a record surge in cargo theft in which criminal networks in the U.S. and abroad exploit technology intended to improve supply chain efficiency and use it to steal truckloads of valuable products. Armed with doctored invoices, the fraudsters impersonate the staff of legitimate companies in order to divert cargo into the hands of criminals. I think that it will soon be quite common to see armed guards accompanying trucks and trains that are transporting cargo across our country. Our society really is coming apart at the seams all around us. Now a period of extreme economic uncertainty is upon us, and that is going to make our societal instability a whole lot worse.

Surpassing Amazon was just the beginning – what does Bitcoin’s $2 trillion leap tell us about the market’s next move? Bitcoin [BTC] has broken through the $100K threshold once again, reaching a remarkable $104K after weeks of downward pressure. According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, BTC was trading at $103,234.98 at press time, posting a 3.67% daily gain and an impressive 33.63% surge over the past month. But perhaps the most striking development is Bitcoin’s latest milestone, and that is, it has officially overtaken Amazon in market capitalization. As of the 9th of May, Bitcoin’s valuation soared to $2.045 trillion, narrowly edging past Amazon’s $2.039 trillion cap. While Amazon stock continues to climb, trading at $192.08 with a 1.79% gain, Bitcoin’s ascent signals more than just a price rally. With this move, it has also surpassed the market caps of silver, Google’s parent company Alphabet, and Meta, positioning itself as the world’s fifth-largest asset by market capitalization, according to CompanyMarketCap. Remarking on the same, Sina G., co-founder and COO of 21st Capital, noted, “Bitcoin just surpassed Amazon to become the 5th largest asset in the world. – No CEO – No headquarters – No marketing team Just code, conviction, and global demand. Next stop: NVIDIA.” Source: Sina/X Once considered a fringe investment, Bitcoin now stands shoulder to shoulder with traditional financial powerhouses, signaling its evolution into a mainstream store of value. That being said, this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has challenged Big Tech’s dominance. Back in April 2025, it briefly overtook both Amazon and Google with a $1.86 trillion valuation, reaching $94,000 per coin amid easing U.S.–China trade tensions and a tech-led market rally. However, the latest surge beyond $100,000 appears far more resilient, with Bitcoin surpassing its previous peak and firmly asserting itself among the world’s most valuable assets, especially after briefly hitting $109,000 during President Trump’s re-inauguration in January 2025. Needless to say, Bitcoin’s explosive rally hasn’t just shaken up trader sentiment; it’s sparked broader conversations among corporate giants. In fact, with nearly $1 billion in liquidations and over 190,000 traders caught off guard, the market is experiencing its most significant short squeeze since 2021, as per CoinGlass’ recent analysis. Source: CoinGlass Therefore, as BTC continues to assert itself as a dominant financial asset, even traditional players are starting to take notice. Notably, back in December 2024, Amazon faced pressure from the National Center for Public Policy Research to consider adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The proposal urges the tech giant to allocate part of its $88 billion in reserves to BTC, underscoring how the cryptocurrency’s ascent is beginning to influence boardroom decisions and long-term corporate finance strategies.

Optifuel vs Competitors A Clear Look at the Competitive Landscape In today’s crowded market of fuel-saving devices, dozens of OBD2 chips claim to offer fuel efficiency, smoother rides, and performance gains. However, many of these products are ineffective, unverified, or designed without true engine integration. The Optifuel Fuel Saver, on the other hand, distinguishes itself with genuine ECU communication, adaptive logic, and verifiable results backed by thousands of satisfied users. Here’s how Optifuel compares to some of the most commonly marketed alternatives: 1. Real ECU Communication Many competing products, such as EcoOBD2, Fuel Save Pro, and Nitro OBD2 clones, do not actually communicate with the car’s Engine Control Unit (ECU). Instead, they rely on pre-programmed scripts or offer no functional tuning at all. In contrast, the Opti Fuel OBD2 Chip actively engages with your car’s ECU, allowing it to analyze and adapt to your driving behavior in real time. 2. Adaptive Performance Tuning Unlike static devices that apply a generic adjustment across all vehicles, Optifuel uses an adaptive learning phase. Over approximately 150 miles, the chip gathers data about your driving habits and engine load. This allows it to create a custom optimization profile that is unique to your car, improving fuel efficiency in a way that static alternatives simply cannot match. 3. Emissions and Efficiency Support Optifuel helps support cleaner combustion by optimizing fuel-air ratios and engine timing. While it does not guarantee passing an emissions test, it may contribute to reduced pollutants and improved fuel economy. Competing products typically lack this level of calibration and often make unverified claims regarding emissions improvements. Disclaimer: Optifuel’s optimization may result in cleaner fuel burn, but results vary. This product is not an emissions compliance device and should not be solely relied upon to pass state or federal emissions testing. 4. Verified Customer Experiences Optifuel stands out for its strong base of real-world users reporting fuel savings, smoother rides, and reliable performance. Many of the competing devices on the market suffer from poor user feedback, questionable results, and a lack of credible reviews. Optifuel’s legitimacy is supported by a growing number of independent user testimonials and expert reviews. 5. Transparent Return Policy and Warranty One of the most overlooked differences is customer protection. Optifuel offers a clearly stated refund policy and product warranty (details available on the official website). By comparison, many marketplace clones offer no returns, no support, and no warranty coverage—leaving consumers with a non-functional device and no recourse. Always refer to the official Optifuel website for the most up-to-date information regarding pricing, warranty, and refund policy. Product details may change without notice. Final Thoughts on the Competition While cheaper products might appear attractive initially, they often fail to deliver results and offer little to no customer protection. The Optifuel Fuel Saver justifies its value by offering real functionality, adaptive performance improvement, and professional support—all in a simple, plug-and-play format that drivers can trust. No tools, no hassle—just plug in Optifuel and drive. Upgrade your car’s efficiency in minutes. Buy today and start saving instantly!

Reported Improvements from Verified Users Across online reviews and feedback channels, several common benefits have emerged: What People Are Saying “I was skeptical, but after two weeks of using Optifuel, I noticed a real change. My fuel gauge is moving slower, and I haven’t changed how I drive.” — Jason M., verified buyer. “I do Uber full time and drive over 500 miles a week. Since I installed the chip, I’m getting more miles per tank and the ride feels smoother overall.” — Erica D., rideshare driver. “Easy to install, and I like that it doesn’t mess with my car’s warranty. It just sits there and does its job.” — Ronald T., delivery van driver. Balanced Feedback Matters While most reviews are positive, it’s important to highlight that not all users see the same results. A few users have reported minor or delayed improvements, which is often attributed to: Still, even among these users, many noted no harm or negative impact, which speaks to the safety and non-intrusive nature of the chip. Patterns Observed in Reviews After analyzing hundreds of user comments and feedback entries, here are the most commonly used phrases associated with the Optifuel experience: These phrases suggest the product’s resonance with everyday drivers who value functionality, convenience, and low-effort fuel optimization. Say goodbye to fuel waste. Optifuel learns your driving and saves you money with every trip. Limited-time offer—buy now! Expert Take: Is Optifuel Fuel Saver Legit or a Scam? Cutting Through the Hype in a Crowded Market With so many fuel-saving devices available online—some promising instant results and others flooding the market with flashy but ineffective products—it's only natural for consumers to ask: “Is the Optifuel Fuel Saver actually legit?” The short answer: Yes, Optifuel is one of the few products in its category that is backed by both logic and consistent user-reported improvements. Unlike knock-off OBD2 chips or static plug-in resistors, the Opti Fuel OBD2 Chip is engineered to communicate with your car’s ECU in real time and adapt its optimization strategies based on real-world data. The Legitimacy Checklist Here’s what separates Optifuel from questionable products: 1. Transparent Calibration Process Most ineffective fuel savers claim "instant improvement" right out of the box. Optifuel, however, clearly outlines a 150-mile learning period—a process that makes sense from a mechanical and software integration perspective. This aligns with how ECUs adapt over time to sensor data. 2. Real-Time ECU Communication Gimmick devices usually don’t interact with the car’s brain—the ECU. Optifuel does. It taps into the OBD2 diagnostic system, analyzes sensor outputs, and optimizes engine functions such as fuel-air ratios and ignition timing for better combustion. 3. Non-Invasive Operation Unlike performance tuning modules or remapping services that overwrite your ECU permanently, Optifuel works non-destructively. It makes adaptive adjustments without voiding warranties or altering factory software. This makes it a safe and reversible option for everyday drivers. 4. Consistent User Reports and Public Reviews While not every driver reports dramatic gains, the majority of feedback includes improved MPG, better throttle response, and a smoother overall ride. These testimonials consistently cite ease of use and the legitimacy of the product’s function. Addressing the Skeptics Understandably, some buyers are wary due to bad experiences with similar-looking devices. It's worth noting that Optifuel’s design and functionality are often imitated by unverified sellers. Purchasing from the official Optifuel website is essential to ensure product authenticity, access to warranty coverage, and customer support. Disclaimer: Do not purchase from unauthorized resellers. Counterfeit or cloned products may not function as described, and results cannot be guaranteed outside of official purchases. What Experts Say About Adaptive OBD2 Chips Automotive engineers and diagnostics specialists generally agree on one thing: if an OBD2 chip is going to work, it must interact with your ECU and gather ongoing data to adjust fuel parameters. Static chips without this capability are unlikely to produce any measurable results. Optifuel aligns with this recommendation by focusing on adaptive logic, real-time tuning, and driver-specific performance mapping. It’s not a racing chip or horsepower booster—it’s a smart fuel-saving device that works with your car, not against it. Final Verdict from a Technical Perspective No product is a magic fix, but Optifuel Fuel Saver delivers on its core promise: using intelligent diagnostics and real-time vehicle data to make small but impactful changes that can enhance car engine performance and reduce fuel waste. When combined with a well-maintained vehicle and consistent driving patterns, it’s a cost-effective, plug-and-play solution that earns its place among legitimate fuel-saving options.

Title: Companies are culling managers. Mark Zuckerberg explained his 'mathematical' approach to it nearly 2 years ago.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-why-companies-laying-off-managers-flattening-org-structure-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-09T18:15:33Z
Full Content:
"How many managers to have — what are the pros and cons of managers?" The question was posed to Mark Zuckerberg nearly two years ago during an interview with the podcaster Lex Fridman. At the time, the Meta CEO — still sporting his shorter "Caesar" haircut — had kicked off the "Great Flattening" trend, culling middle managers amid his "year of efficiency" as a correction to overhiring during the pandemic. But as companies beyond Big Tech, the latest being the Tinder owner Match Group, pare back managerial roles, Zuckerberg's answer to the podcaster's question in June 2023 remains relevant — and helps explain why CEOs continue to thin out management ranks. The Facebook founder began by acknowledging that managers are an important component of a company like Meta. "I believe a lot in management," he said. "I think there are some people who think that it doesn't matter as much, but look, we have a lot of younger people at the company. For them, this is their first job, and people need to grow and learn in their career." Zuckerberg said there was "a mathematical way" he thought about the ratio of employees to managers and making cuts. Before Meta's layoffs, Zuckerberg said he had asked about the average number of direct reports each manager had at the company and learned it was about three to four. He said he felt it should be more like seven to eight. The lower numbers made sense at the time, Zuckerberg said, as Meta was hiring a ton and helping newcomers ramp up. "So in a world where we're not adding so many people as quickly, is it as valuable to have a lot of managers who have extra capacity waiting for new people? No, right?" Zuckerberg said. He said he decided to "defragment the organization," thinning out the ranks of middle management, which "decreases the latency on information going up and down the chain and I think empowers people more." It all added up to a leaner organization that he felt could move faster in both decision-making and execution. Elsewhere in the interview, Zuckerberg mentioned that the cuts came at a time of uncertainty in the world. As companies navigate geopolitical tensions and President Donald Trump's trade war, Zuckerberg's words in 2023 likely ring true to many CEOs today. "I just feel the external world is quite volatile right now," Zuckerberg said in the interview. "And I wanted to make sure that we had a stable position." Middle managers have increasingly found a target on their backs in recent years. Massive companies have followed Meta's lead over the past year, with Amazon and Google moving to flatten their org charts amid a renewed focus on greater efficiency. Their CEOs have similarly voiced their reasons. At Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy said in September that the company would increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of March. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," he said at the time. In short, he told employees in a November all-hands, "I hate bureaucracy." Google is cutting manager, director, and vice president roles by 10%, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in December. Pichai said Google had made changes designed to simplify the company and boost its efficiency, two employees who heard the CEO's comments previously told Business Insider. In September 2022, he'd said he wanted Google to be 20% more efficient; months later, the company conducted a massive round of layoffs, eliminating 12,000 jobs. "Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth," Pichai told staff in an email about those layoffs. "To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today." Salesforce in 2023 slashed some layers of management and turned some managers into individual contributors, with the goal of reducing the "spans" and "layers of control" across the company. Earlier that year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced layoffs of 10% of the workforce as part of a cost-cutting restructuring plan. In his memo to staff, he cited pandemic overhiring and a "challenging" economic environment as reasons for the cuts. Middle managers made up nearly one-third of layoffs among white-collar workers in 2023, an analysis by Live Data Technologies for Bloomberg found. Match Group, the parent company of dating apps like Tinder and Hinge, announced this week a 13% reduction in its workforce, affecting one in five managers. Beyond tech, the focus on flattening has extended to behemoths of other industries. Citi in 2023 announced it was paring back its layers of management from 13 to eight; the company later announced cuts affecting 1,500 managerial roles. At the start of 2024, UPS said it was laying off 12,000 of its 85,000 managers. Some workplace experts have said the Great Flattening targeting middle managers could hurt workforces, as middle managers often carry out vital responsibilities like executing on upper management's goals and boosting employees' morale and performance. The trend is continuing as companies decide that restructuring to decrease the number of managers is the right move to appease investors who are zeroed in on efficiency, especially after the pandemic hiring boom in tech. Or as Zuckerberg previously said: "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work."

Title: The global war on farming gathers pace

Editor Economy Alex Krainer British farmers are pushing back, but the government is preparing large-scale culling of livestock toward the end of 2025 [Originally published in I-System TrendCompass] Over the last few years I’m noticing that the grocery stores where I buy my food are less and less supplied with certain foods, particularly organic meat and periodically milk and eggs. The difference is very obvious and my Carrefour supermarket even reduced the shelf space where these foods are displayed. Certain types of meat that used to be regularly available are no longer are (at all, ever), and I can only find them from specialty butcher shops which thankfully still exist in France (although they are noticeably fewer now than they used to be). This is not an accident but, as the British farmer and activist Mark Byford (a.k.a. the Bowler Hat Farmer) lays out in this (highly recommended) interview, it is part of the global war on farming, comprising a barrage of administrative and regulatory measures designed to make farming unprofitable, incentivizing farmers not to produce food and encouraging them to sell their farms: it’s war on carbon, war on nitrogen, war on bird flu and other viruses, war on Russian fertilizers, inheritance taxes, rewilding schemes, “get out of farming” payouts and burgeoning compliance rules and bureaucracies to oversee it all. For example, Byford explained that if you grow wheat in Britain, you can earn about £160 per acre. It’s hard work and it involves considerable expense. At the same time, the government is promoting the so-called “set-aside” or rewilding schemes and will pay farmers £300-£400 per acre to let weeds grow on their land. For farmers, it’s more income, less expense and less work. Another line of attack has been directed at milk production: farmers are locked into exclusive supply contracts with corporate buyers who often fail to collect the milk. As a consequence, tens of thousands of liters a day are being simply dumped, causing farmers massive financial losses. Apparently, given the nature of their supply contracts, they have no way of recovering these losses. As a result, milk shortages appear at the same time as the farmers are forced to dump about half of their production. Egg shortage has been orchestrated under “bird flu” emergencies, justifying the culling of millions of birds. Food production is also being suffocated through regulatory measures. Active farmers are buried under the burgeoning regulatory requirements, forcing them to spend long hours filing endless forms to be compliant with burgeoning rules and regulations. Many of the new rules, including the “get out of farming payments scheme,” effectively punish or discourage food production while incentivizing the farmers to sell their farms. Farmland is then often bought by global investment behemoths like BlackRock and Vanguard. The result is that livestock is gradually disappearing and food production is shrinking, which is by now obvious to see in our supermarkets. Now there are reports that the UK government is planning a mass culling of livestock towards the end of 2025. According to Byford, similar measures are being pursued in Ireland, the EU as well as in India and many African countries with the effect that today there is 72% less food moving through global distribution chains than in the pre-pandemic period. Most probably, this is all caused by climate change or perhaps Russia, Russia, Russia, or China, China, China. However, there’s also a strange coincidence that all these measures appear to have been planned. A major policy paper, titled “Absolute Zero,” was published on 29 November 2019 as a collaboration between the leading British universities including Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and the Imperial College of London. This was all funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and it laid out the strategy of reaching zero carbon emissions in accordance with the chillingly distopian UK Climate Change Act of 2008. The Absolute Zeros recommended that, “In addition to reducing our energy demand, delivering zero emissions with today’s technologies requires the phasing out of flying, shipping, lamb and beef, blast furnace steel and cement.” It’s interesting that the UK has now shut down its last blast furnace making it the only G7 nation without a steel industry. Meanwhile, as far as the corporate media are concerned, this is a “China, China, China” story, and nobody’s mentioning the “Absolute Zero” agenda. Anyhow, back to farming: the agenda is that between 2020 and 2029, the consumption of beef and lamb must drop by 50% and by 2050 it must be “phased out.” Also, all construction of new buildings must cease by 2050. “Absolute Zero” agenda (note, it was drafted well in advance of the Covid 19 pandemic), has full support and commitment of the British government, the same government that has incentivized billions of pounds to be invested in solar energy and is now planning to spray the skies to dim the sun. Of course, the genius behind Absolute Zero plans have anticipated resistance from proles and peasants of the nation, so they touched upon the behavioral measures that will be necessary: “The changes in behaviour to achieve Absolute Zero are clearly substantial. In principle, these changes could be induced through changing prices and thus providing clear incentives for behaviour to change. The alternative is that the government prohibits certain types of behaviour and regulates production processes.” Evidently, those who set the agenda understand that they must achieve their objectives against the will of the people and that the changes must “be induced.” Thankfully, the deplorable farmers and the proles have other ideas and pushback is building up along with alternative food systems, organized from the bottom up. We can expect the governments in the UK and elsewhere to try and suppress these alternatives, but having or not having food to eat is too important to capitulate to government intimidation. However, broader awareness and support for farmers will be needed in this struggle. Economy Economy Economy Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Remember last week when Aurora met a major milestone — just squeaking by under its own deadline — and launched a driverless self-driving truck service? Welp, this week Aurora made headlines again, but for a surprising change in leadership. Co-founder Sterling Anderson, who has been chief product officer, is resigning from his position and the board. No real word on what prompted his resignation, beyond some comments he made during the company’s Q1 earnings call. “Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said. “This is precisely what gave me the confidence that now is the right time.” He didn’t say exactly where he was going, either, except that it will be an “exciting external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company.” I’ll let you all place your bets. Aurora is pressing on without Anderson. The company announced during its earnings call that it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind by the second half of 2025. The company also plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston, and into El Paso and Phoenix. Got a tip for us?

But then again, these aren’t normal times. Especially for any company caught up in the U.S.-China trade war. Take Zeekr, for instance. One year ago, the Chinese EV company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, parent company Geely Auto wants to take Zeekr private in response to the Trump administration’s idea to kick Chinese companies off American stock exchanges. Other deals that got my attention … Bosch Ventures has a new $270 million fund that will continue its tradition of investing in deep tech startups. Managing director Ingo Ramesohl told TechCrunch the plan is to put more of its money into North American startups. Investors who previously backed Indian Uber rival BluSmart have proposed a plan to inject another $30 million into the struggling cab-hailing startup, which abruptly halted operations last month. But there’s a catch. Breathe, a battery software startup, raised $21 million in a Series B round led by Kinnevik Online AB, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lowercarbon Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund participated. DoorDash announced two major acquisitions as it expands into Europe. The company agreed to buy its U.K. rival Deliveroo for about £2.9 billion (around $3.87 billion) and separately said it is buying SevenRooms — which provides CRM, marketing, and operations software to help restaurants, hotels, and public venues with reservations and guest management — for $1.2 billion in cash. Meanwhile, Uber was busy this week, acquiring companies and investing in them. Uber increased its investment into Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide by $100 million as part of an expanded partnership deal to bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. In a separate deal, Uber also acquired an 85% controlling stake in Trendyol Go, the online meal and grocery delivery business based in Istanbul, for about $700 million in cash. Here’s a personnel switch I didn’t expect. Mo Elshenawy, the former president and CTO of now-shuttered self-driving car company Cruise, was just named the chief technology officer at telehealth and wellness company Hims & Hers. I spoke to Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum, and he said he specifically focused on the AV industry to find the next CTO. Here’s why. Nuro has started testing its AV tech on the Las Vegas Strip. I recently sat down with co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Stay tuned for an update on why the company shifted its business model. Tesla‘s “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab” trademarks have hit a few roadblocks. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Tesla’s attempt to trademark the term “Robotaxi” in reference to its vehicles because it’s too generic. Meanwhile, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” were halted because of companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks. Uber locked up partnerships with three Chinese autonomous vehicle companies — Pony AI, Momenta, and WeRide — in a bid to gobble up robotaxi market share in the Middle East and Europe. Footnote: These deals are not to operate in China. Waymo announced it has a new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa through a deal with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. That obviously got a lot of attention. But I was most interested in finally learning the size of Waymo’s existing commercial fleet, which is now 1,500. Wayve is making the rounds on the high-profile executive set. You might remember the video of Bill Gates in one of Wayve’s autonomous test vehicles. Now it’s Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson’s turn. P.S. Branson is a Wayve investor. BTW, Fortune Brainstorm held its AI conference in London, and Wayve CEO and co-founder Alex Kendall was there. He had some interesting comments about the company’s end-to-end approach and Tesla’s Elon Musk. Zoox paused its driverless testing program for more than a week and issued a voluntary recall of its software following a crash in Las Vegas. The Cadillac Celestiq EV — yep, that monster — is here, and contributor Emme Hall has thoughts after spending a day behind the wheel. It’s earnings season, and the U.S.-China trade war is starting to leave a scratch on the paint of automakers everywhere. And, well, I don’t think we’ll be able to buff it out. Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump’s tariffs. Meanwhile, Rivian said it will likely deliver fewer vehicles this year (40,000 to 46,000 EVs) than previously forecasted due to tariffs and other regulatory changes. Reminder: The company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut. There was some good news for Rivian, though: It generated gross profit (yeah I know, gross profit isn’t exactly my fave, either). But this met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker. Ford is raising the price of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV and the Maverick pickup by as much as $2,000 due to the import taxes Trump is placing on vehicles made in Mexico. Lucid Motors has been working through some quality “hiccups” in the early stages of delivering its long-awaited electric Gravity SUV. Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with Foxconn to source an electric car model the Japanese automaker plans to sell in Australia and New Zealand in the latter half of 2026.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft Vice Chairman and President Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

Title: Million-Dollar Careers, The Elite Seven Figures Club

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Investment Bankers discussing an important deal in a darkly lit wood panel conference room. Many people want to succeed in their careers. Some struggle, and others find ways to do well. There is a small segment of the population who were able to amass financial fortunes for their efforts. Earning an annual income of $1 million or more is a remarkable achievement. This milestone is attainable, but rare. Less than 0.5% of U.S. households earn over $1 million annually, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data and recent payroll analyses. In high-earning regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area, only about 0.54% of employees reach this threshold. Certain industries are constructed to produce high earners. A confluence of factors like economic dynamics, market demand, having the right skills and being in the right place at the right time helps. The finance sector, encompassing the stock market, hedge funds, and private equity, is a money generating powerhouse. Hedge fund managers who oversee portfolios with assets exceeding $250 million can earn between $500,000 and $3 million annually. This is how it works. Hedge fund managers traditionally are compensated under what is called a "2 and 20" fee structure. This entails a charge of a 2% annual management fee on the fund's assets under management (AUM) and a 20% performance fee on the fund's profits. As their portfolio grows, the higher the payout will be for the manager. According to Institutional Investor, Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, earned approximately $2.6 billion in 2023, making him the third highest-earning hedge fund manager that year. The 2024 North American Private Equity Investment Professional Compensation Survey by Heidrick & Struggles indicates, private equity managing directors and partners typically earn total cash compensation including base salary plus bonus, ranging from $700,000 to $2 million, depending on fund size and performance. Private equity (PE), including firms like BlackRock, is an investment strategy in which PE acquires stakes in other privately or publicly held companies, with the goal of increasing their value and then selling them off for big profits. Investment banking Managing Directors (MDs) at bulge-bracket investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, facilitate large deals like mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs). If successful, this can earn total compensation packages that exceed $1 million per year for the MDs. This includes a base salary typically between $350,000 and $600,000, with bonuses often matching or exceeding base salaries. Real estate is another lucrative area. Top agents in luxury markets like Los Angeles earn huge commissions on multimillion-dollar properties. Luxury real estate agents in Los Angeles and similar markets, typically earn commissions ranging from 2% to 3% per transaction. For a $10 million sale, a 3% commission would be about $300,000. Agents who hustle to sell these high priced homes can hit the one million or more level. However, commission rates are often negotiated, and for high-value properties, agents may accept lower percentages. Professional sports and entertainment mint millionaires through their talent. Elite athletes in the NBA, NFL, and MLB secure contracts worth tens of millions of dollars annually. For example, LeBron James earned a salary of about $48.7 million in 2024, according to Forbes. Additionally, his total earnings, including endorsements, reached around $128 million. LeBron’s endorsement deals alone are estimated at around $80 million annually. A-list actors and entertainers mirror this. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is a US-based labor union for film, television, video games, and commercial performers. Their rates of $2,000–$3,000 per day could potentially total millions. The real big money is in the blockbuster movies and television serieses. Well known actors stars like Dwayne Johnson can earn $20 million per film, per industry data. Influencers and media personalities, like Jim Cramer, can make millions through TV deals and sponsorships, with continuing fast growth in the influencer creator economy valued at $250 billion in 2024 per Goldman Sachs. Entrepreneurship offers a way to wealth. Founders in tech, and Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists can hit it big. Also, mom-and-pop retail, or services can scale to businesses making million-dollar profits. About 1% of U.S. small business owners, roughly 300,000, achieve this annually, per IRS data. Healthcare, especially highly specialized medicine, enables seven-figure incomes, with top neurosurgeons and cardiac surgeons often exceeding $1 million in private practice. This is driven by demand for life-saving procedures, per a 2023 physician compensation study. Corporate leadership is a significant driver, with S&P 500 CEOs earning a median of $17.9 million in 2025 (projected from Equilar’s 2023 figure of $16.3 million), while the top 100 CEOs at firms with over $1 billion in revenue reach a median of $32 million. The highest earners, like the low key profile Jim Anderson, the head of Saxonburg, Pa.-based company Coherent, which makes equipment and products for networks and laser systems, is the new highest-paid CEO in the U.S. with a total salary of $101,497,009 for 2024, according to executive intelligence company Equilar. Moon shots like Elon Musk, heading Tesla, SpaceX, the X-platform, Neuralink and other endeavors may potentially be hitting $1 billion in stock and incentive based pay or more. The tech sector is a major contributor to high earners. Typical compensation packages for senior software engineers and managers at top tech firms like Google, Meta, and Apple, ranges from $200,000 to $500,000. With stock appreciation, stock grants, bonuses and restricted stock units (RSUs), compensation where an employer grants shares of company stock, which vest over a specific period, tied to performance or time with the company, could propel the total package into the seven figure club. Some tech titans who are in a hot space, such as AI, can see $1 million and more in a strong year, often due to large equity grants, RSUs or stock windfalls. One underappreciated factor in these careers is the power of leverage. In finance, earnings scale with assets managed. $1 billion at a 2% fee nets $20 million for the firm, a chunk of which flows to the manager. Tech professionals leverage equity, where RSUs can multiply total compensation during market booms, though this ties earnings to volatile stock performance, a risk often overlooked. In real estate and entrepreneurship, leveraging loans or investor capital can amplify returns. Timing is another critical element. Finance and tech professionals thrive in bull markets, while athletes and entertainers face short peak earning windows. LeBron James’ pivot to a business empire exemplifies the need to diversify early. The path to $1 million is filled with setbacks. This includes failed startups, market crashes, athletes getting injured. Hollywood stars lose their luster or get bad investment advice can quickly make a person lose their one million plus compensation.

Title: REI Union’s successful ‘Vote No’ campaign leaves 3 board seats empty

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The outdoor category has faltered with the end of its pandemic boom, and the retailer reported a 2024 net sales decline, though losses narrowed. REI expressed disappointment Thursday after its membership failed to elect three board members — including two incumbents — it had nominated ahead of its annual meeting. But the REI Union called it a win for its “Vote No” campaign, saying in a statement that “REI members and REI workers stood together to send a resounding message that it is time for the co-op to return to its core values.” Since 2022, eleven REI stores have voted to unionize. The outdoor retailer also released financial results for 2024, reporting that net sales fell more than 6% year over year to $3.5 billion. Net loss narrowed, though, shrinking nearly 50% to $156.4 million, and the co-op closed out the year in a cash-flow neutral position. As a pandemic-era boom has fizzled for the outdoor category, several retailers including REI have scrambled to adjust. In addition to corporate layoffs last year, the retailer downsized then eliminated its experiences business, tightened up its return policy and hired a new CEO. Its failure to get its preferred nominees onto its board overshadowed other announcements from the company, including that last year it “became the first major U.S. retailer to achieve the industry definition of zero waste, diverting 90% of waste from landfills across its operations.” REI Board Chair Chris Carr said the retailer is “losing two incumbent directors who have been valuable contributors to the co-op for a number of years and one promising new director. Therefore, on behalf of the board, I would like to extend my gratitude and appreciation to them.” But in its statement, the union expressed optimism that newly arrived CEO Mary Beth Laughton would take it as an “opportunity to listen to everyone who voted for workers and members to have a voice in the company’s future.” “Moving forward, REI should stop union busting, negotiate a fair contract with organized workers, and fill the vacancies on the board with the candidates that members backed initially,” the union said. The union had put forward two environmental leaders —Tefere Gebre, of the AFL-CIO and Greenpeace, and Shemona Moreno of 350.org — and REI members sent in more than 10,000 co-nominations for them. REI did not put either on the ballot. The labor group is calling on REI to fill two of the three now-empty board seats with those candidates. Gebre said Thursday he’d “still be happy to serve and work toward making sure workers and members are represented fairly.” Carr said that, per REI’s bylaws, the three seats will remain vacant until the board fills them. REI’s progressive image has tarnished as it continues to fight unionizing at its stores, often in a manner resembling Amazon’s. The retailer in 2023 hired law firm Morgan Lewis, known for its work against union efforts on behalf of Amazon and other employers, when union organizers accused it of unfair labor practices. There are still 35 charges documenting 175 violations of labor law pending with the National Labor Relations Board, the union said Thursday.

Title: What Trump’s Policies Mean for Latin America

Full Content:
US President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office have largely focused on trade and immigration policy. Latin American countries haven’t borne the brunt of these protectionist measures, and in some cases have collaborated with his administration, but that doesn’t mean that they will be immune to the fallout. MEXICO CITY – Latin America has not figured prominently in US President Donald Trump’s foreign and trade policies during his first 100 days in office, despite the appointment of a Latino – Marco Rubio – as Secretary of State. But that does not mean the region has been spared the fallout from his controversial decisions on drugs, immigration, trade, or foreign policy. More worryingly, all signs point to continued upheaval. Trump’s return to the White House has been felt more acutely in Mexico than in any other Latin American country. But many of his most extreme threats, such as mass deportations of Mexicans and other immigrants to the country, have not materialized. This is partly because far fewer people are entering the United States without papers (many of those deported under former US President Joe Biden fell into this category), and partly because finding and expelling undocumented aliens is a logistical nightmare. As a result, the dozens of shelters the Mexican government hastily prepared for deportees remain largely empty, although that could change in the future. Trump’s promised moves against the Mexican drug cartels have also gone nowhere. Trump has designated some of them as foreign terrorist organizations – thereby empowering his administration to impose economic penalties and take military action against these groups – but has stopped short of implementing such measures. While drone flights and spy-plane incursions into Mexican airspace have increased, these were already taking place under the Biden administration. As for trade, keeping track of each new tariff announcement – and its subsequent pause – for a country like Mexico, which has received “special” treatment from Trump, is undoubtedly difficult. True, Mexico was exempt from Trump’s most recent round of “reciprocal” tariffs, and the 10% baseline tariff imposed during the 90-day pause. But the country remains subject to a 25% tariff on all exports that do not comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, allegedly to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration, as well as 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, and auto parts. Other countries may have it worse, but Mexico is by no means insulated from Trump’s trade war. Several Central and South American countries have also experienced the whiplash of Trump’s on-off trade war. The “reciprocal” tariffs were particularly jarring for the 10 other countries – including Chile, Colombia, and Peru – that have signed free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, even if their rates were comparatively low. The cozy relationship between Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Trump was not even enough to insulate the country, which also has an FTA with the US, from this blitz. Others, like Brazil, are suffering from the 25% tariff on steel. Moreover, the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for free trade has also dashed Argentina’s hopes of signing its own FTA with the US. More importantly, though, many Central American countries are cooperating with the administration on immigration. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Nicaragua have agreed to accept non-national deportees from the US. While the most highly publicized example is the roughly 200 Venezuelans who were removed from America and sent to the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in El Salvador, there are many others. So far, deportation numbers have remained low, largely for the same reasons as in the case of Mexico, but could increase soon. But these partnerships are nothing new. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – the “Northern Triangle” – have long functioned as “safe third countries” for the US and will continue to do so. Our Forward Thinkers list recognizes and spotlights intellectual innovators poised to shape international debates in the years ahead. It brings together 30 influential individuals from academia, policymaking, civil society, and the private sector — voices challenging conventional wisdom and blazing a new path. Meet the Forward Thinkers Panama has fared much worse, becoming a battleground for the Sino-American rivalry. Trump wants the Panama Canal back, and no one knows how far he is willing to go to achieve this goal. An apparent Panamanian concession – the sale of two Chinese-owned ports to BlackRock – seems to have been held up by the Chinese government. The intensifying geopolitical and economic conflict between the superpowers bodes ill for the isthmic country’s future. Trump has also taken aim at Venezuela and Cuba. The administration’s initial ambivalence toward Venezuela – Trump’s team was negotiating deportation flights with President Nicolás Maduro’s regime while simultaneously ending Chevron’s permit to pump and export Venezuelan oil – was quickly replaced by a campaign of “maximum pressure.” This includes a 25% tariff on countries that import Venezuelan oil and the extension of existing sanctions. Rumors are swirling that Trump’s negotiators have reached an agreement with the Venezuelan opposition, whereby – in exchange for ousting Maduro – the US would be granted unfettered access to Venezuela’s immense oil reserves. But these reports have proved hard to substantiate. In any case, Trump and Rubio are unlikely to moderate their aggressive approach, even if harsher sanctions increase the number of Venezuelans fleeing the country. The same is true for Cuba. Tightening the screws will only deepen the island’s misery, fueling the exodus of Cubans, some of whom will flee to the US. But Rubio’s Cuban-American heritage will probably prevent him from embracing a realistic strategy. Instead, the administration may strengthen the economic embargo on Cuba, further restricting travel and the flow of remittances. And if Trump imposes secondary sanctions, like those imposed on Venezuela, Cubans will only become more impoverished and desperate. Trump’s attention may be focused elsewhere, but this does not mean that Latin American countries are immune to the consequences of his decisions. The intensifying US-China conflict, the threat of a global recession triggered by the incipient trade war, and the weakening of international institutions traditionally will have far-reaching consequences for the region – even for countries that have stayed off the US president’s radar.

Title: Abu Dhabi’s IHC, BlackRock Start $1 Billion Reinsurance Firm

The yet-to-be-named firm will launch with more than $1 billion in initial equity commitments and aims to manage $10 billion in liabilities, backed by partnerships with BlackRock and Abu Dhabi-based asset manager Lunate, according to a statement. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone, ADGM, the firm will be chaired by Sultan Al Jaber — the United Arab Emirates’ minister for industry and advanced technology. It will be led by Mark Wilson, the former chief executive officer of Aviva Plc and AIA Group Ltd. BlackRock will provide an initial minority investment and will support the venture with insurance asset management, advisory services and technology. Lunate will serve as a partner, offering its experience across public and private markets. The new firm will make use of AI as a core part of the strategy, enhancing underwriting capabilities by improving the quality and speed of risk assessments. BlackRock received a commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi last year, and the latest deal deepens its ties to the emirate. The firm is partnering with MGX on a partnership that aims to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. Lunate, meanwhile, acquired a stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines from BlackRock and KKR & Co. last year. IHC, MGX, and Lunate are part of a vast empire overseen by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — the UAE’s national security adviser and a brother to its president. The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, has been pushing to diversify away from its dependence on oil. It’s expanding into areas like technology, finance and health care. Home to three sovereign wealth funds that control close to $1.7 trillion in assets, Abu Dhabi has become a magnet for international investors. At the same time, the UAE has pushed global financial giants to set up local partnerships to help build the domestic economy.

Title: Stripe's Quiet Revolution: Rebuilding Global Finance with Stablecoin Accounts

블록체인 In May 2025, global payments platform Stripe quietly signaled a powerful shift in the financial landscape. Stripe has launched a stablecoin-based financial account service in over 101 countries worldwide. This move is more than just a new feature-it’s a bold statement of Stripe’s ambition to reshape the global financial system from the ground up. In this post, we’ll explore why Stripe introduced this service, the technology and strategy behind it, and what impact this transformation could have on our daily lives. Despite decades of innovation, global finance still faces persistent structural challenges. Stripe aims to address these hurdles by leveraging blockchain and stablecoin technology. Their goal: to build an infrastructure where anyone with an internet connection can safely and affordably manage dollar-denominated assets-no matter where they are in the world. Stripe’s new financial account service offers several key features: ✅ Available in 101 CountriesBusinesses in most parts of the world can now open and manage these accounts. ✅ Integration of On-Chain & Traditional Financial NetworksFunds can be sent and received via both conventional banking rails (ACH, wire transfers) and blockchain networks (such as Ethereum), giving users unprecedented flexibility. ✅ Stablecoin SupportThe accounts support Circle’s USDC and Stripe’s own USDB stablecoin, enabling both digital asset transactions and secure asset custody. ✅ Visa Card Integration Coming SoonStripe plans to launch Visa debit and prepaid cards linked to stablecoin balances, allowing users to spend their digital dollars in the real world-imagine buying coffee with USDC. Through its $1.1 billion acquisition of blockchain infrastructure provider Bridge, Stripe now operates its own stablecoin, USDB. In essence, USDB is a “dedicated digital dollar” for Stripe’s business clients, enabling global fund management without the need for a traditional bank account. Stripe’s move is significant not just for Web3 users, but for the broader financial industry: 1. Streamlined B2B Global TransactionsExporters, SaaS providers, and freelancer platforms can dramatically reduce both time and fees for cross-border payments. 2. Integration of Digital Assets with the Real EconomyWith Visa card integration, users will soon be able to receive salaries, dine out, and shop using stablecoins. 3. New Opportunities for the Financially UnderservedEven those without bank accounts can participate in global commerce through Stripe. For startups and freelancers in developing countries, this opens up a new pathway to dollar-based financial services. Stripe is no longer just a payment API provider. With this announcement, it is positioning itself as a “global digital financial infrastructure company.” This strategy goes beyond a technical upgrade-it challenges the very foundations of the traditional banking system, the SWIFT network, and even national currency regimes. Stripe’s launch of stablecoin accounts marks the quiet beginning of a monumental shift. This isn’t just about Web3, fintech, or payments-it’s about redefining the very infrastructure of global finance. It will be fascinating to watch how Stripe expands this strategy, and how other payment giants like PayPal and Adyen respond. Notably, PayPal has already launched its own stablecoin, signaling that the race to build the next-generation financial stack is well underway. 소프트웨어에 날개를 달자.

Title: Cargo thieves are attacking the U.S. supply chain at alarming rates

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time America’s supply chain is under attack. From coast to coast, organized criminal groups are hitting trucks on the road, breaking into warehouses and pilfering expensive items from train cars, according to industry experts and law enforcement officials CNBC interviewed during a six-month investigation. It’s all part of a record surge in cargo theft in which criminal networks in the U.S. and abroad exploit technology intended to improve supply chain efficiency and use it to steal truckloads of valuable products. Armed with doctored invoices, the fraudsters impersonate the staff of legitimate companies in order to divert cargo into the hands of criminals. The widespread scheme is “low risk and a very high reward,” according to Keith Lewis, vice president of Verisk CargoNet, which tracks theft trends in the industry. “The return on investment is almost 100%,” he said. “And if there’s no risk of getting caught, why not do it better and do it faster?” In 2024, Verisk CargoNet recorded 3,798 incidents of cargo theft, representing a 26% increase over 2023. Total reported losses topped nearly $455 million, according to Verisk CargoNet, but industry experts told CNBC that number is likely lower than the true toll because many cases go unreported. Numerous experts who spoke to CNBC estimate losses are close to $1 billion or more a year. Train cargo thefts alone shot up about 40% in 2024, with more than 65,000 reported incidents, according to the Association of American Railroads. Industry experts and law enforcement officials say a more sophisticated and insidious form of cargo theft called strategic theft is also on the rise. The way the system is supposed to work is this: A shipper pays a broker, and the broker, after taking its fee, pays the carrier, the trucking company that moves the load. In strategic theft, criminals use deceptive tactics to trick shippers, brokers or carriers into handing cargo or legitimate payments, sometimes both, over to them instead of the legitimate companies. Strategic theft represented 8% of all cargo theft in 2020, according to Verisk CargoNet figures, but by the end of 2024, it had risen to represent about one-third. Tracking down the fraudsters, particularly if they are overseas, is almost an impossible task, Lewis said. “Think of identity theft,” Lewis said. “Think of a friend that’s had their identity stolen or their credit card stolen. There’s no difference ... There’s no bread crumb trail to follow. It’s a ghost.” Verisk CargoNet said it has tracked criminal groups that have tried to disrupt the U.S. supply chain to origins in 32 countries. “There’s no deterrent for these guys,” said Jerry Jacobs, who oversees risk management at Prosponsive Logistics in Atlanta. The company is a broker connecting shippers with the carriers that move their products. In an interview with CNBC, Jacobs said the criminals “literally have a license to steal.” “You’re hiding out in a foreign country, and all you need is a cell phone and a computer to conduct this type of fraud,” he said. “Every day, we’re seeing the bad guys trying to infiltrate our network. And our sales reps have to constantly stay vigilant,” Jacobs said. “I say this all the time to my sales folks, that there’s probably a 33% chance that you’re going to be talking to a bad guy that’s looking to steal freight.” Jacobs told CNBC during his interview in February that he was actively dealing with a fraud case. The offenders had stolen his company’s identity and were booking shipments, he said. Their goal was to convince a legitimate trucking company to pick up a shipment and unwittingly deliver it so that the criminals, rather than the real carriers, would get paid, he said. Jacobs showed CNBC the online platform used by brokers to book shipments, called DAT Freight and Analytics. There were listings purportedly initiated by his company, but they weren’t legitimate — they were booked, he said, by the criminals. “Right now, we’re dealing with a ton of calls about this,” Jacobs said at the time. “A lot of [carriers], unfortunately, picked up the shipment already for the bad guys, and they have already delivered it for the bad guys.” Weeks later, Jacobs was still dealing with the fallout. He said some of the loads were delivered, but not others, suggesting cargo and payments were stolen in the scheme. None of the carriers were paid, he said. Jacobs said crime costs the average consumer, too, as cargo theft fuels retail price increases. “I have to pay more at the grocery store, at the checkout line, because these bad guys want to come in and steal freight,” he said. Barry Conlon, founder and CEO of Overhaul, an in-transit supply chain security and risk management company based in Austin, Texas, said the crime groups are very familiar with how freight is moved across the U.S. “They have people who are literally pulling the information off websites, scraping it, in some cases,” Conlon told CNBC. “And then they’re attacking at a chosen location once they see the product they want. And it’s literally gone into the supply chain within days.” He contrasted the ease and payoff of cargo theft to the high risk and often lower reward of a bank robbery. “Rob a million-dollar load, that’s going to give you hundreds of thousands of dollars in return. And there’s literally no risk,” he said. Cargo theft, which is almost always nonviolent, is considered a property crime. According to industry experts, it’s underreported for a reason. “A lot of cases, they don’t report it because they feel they’re not going to get it back. It’s been weeks since they lost it and they’ve just found out about it,” Conlon said. Overhaul estimates there will be a 22% increase in incidents of cargo theft in 2025, according to the company’s most recent report on trends in the industry. Scott Cornell, the national transportation leader for insurance company Travelers Insurance, said he is also alarmed at what he’s seeing in the industry. ″[There are] two things that I always point out about the organized cargo theft rings that are committing these crimes,” Cornell said. “They know what to steal and when to steal it, and they’re really good at return on investment.” Food and beverage is the thieves’ No. 1 targeted commodity, according to Verisk CargoNet. “It’s consumable. So, the evidence disappears,” Cornell said. “It’s hard to chase. If you’re a cargo theft investigator and you’re trying to do a recovery investigation, the evidence is going be consumed, right? Or it’s going to spoil. There’s no barcode on a pistachio.” Household goods are the second-most commonly targeted cargo, followed by electronics, Verisk CargoNet found. Cargo loss isn’t something many retailers are eager to talk about. Meta, which was hit by a $500,000 theft of its Ray-Ban and Oculus glasses last year in Texas, declined to comment to CNBC. Nike, whose sneakers are favorites of cargo thieves, according to police and court records, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The problem is “noticeably increasing,” said Birger Buesching, head of the supply chain for Philips’ personal health consumer business, which includes Sonicare toothbrushes and Norelco shavers, among other products. “Two, three years ago, I didn’t have to worry about this,” Buesching told CNBC in February at the Manifest Conference in Las Vegas, where companies that focus on the supply chain showcased solutions to protect it. “But we do see an uptick in any kind of commercial shipments, bigger value shipments that are going out to our customers or traditional retail customers.” Replacing a stolen load is not so simple, he said. “First of all, we can’t ship that load on time and in full as we promise, so we’re letting our customers down,” Buesching said. “Often we have safety stock, so we can usually backfill orders very quickly, within days. But especially when you have custom-made products, then it might take a little longer, because you have to make more of that product.” Ellen Kapiloff, vice president of operations for North and Central America at Lacoste, said the threat of cargo theft can lead to inventory challenges on the floor. “If you’re a consumer and you wanted this shirt and we only made 100 of them and 50 of them were stolen, we are strategically going to place the other 50 in a different location, as well as a different channel,” Kapiloff told CNBC in an interview at the Manifest conference. “So, it might not be available to you at a store or online when you want it.” Coincidentally, in February, just 10 days after CNBC spoke with Kapiloff, California Highway Patrol’s Cargo Theft Interdiction Program served a search warrant at a store in Los Angeles’ fashion district. Officers found five boxes containing Lacoste slides footwear that law enforcement said was part of a large cargo heist. California sees more cargo theft than any other state in the U.S. In a separate case, in May 2024, athletic apparel retailer Lululemon reported a burglary at a distribution center in Ontario, California, in which thieves made off with “well over a million dollars’ worth of Lululemon product,” according to the California Highway Patrol. Police said a person was arrested on suspicion of selling the stolen goods. In a statement to CNBC, Lululemon said, “Retail crime, including cargo theft, is a serious industry-wide challenge, and we are taking decisive action to combat it. ... In this specific case, our collaborative investigation led to arrests and recovery of stolen products.” While there are financial impacts, cargo theft has been mentioned only sparingly in public companies’ earnings conference calls and investor webcasts over the last year. Knight-Swift is the industry’s largest full truckload carrier, but it has only spoken publicly about cargo theft once in the past year, according to a CNBC document search. CEO Adam Miller noted on the company’s October earnings call that it is “starting to hear a lot more comments around cargo security.” “I’ve gone to different conferences here over the last few months, and cargo theft is now a prevailing topic when it really wasn’t discussed that much in the past,” Miller said. On a January conference call for transportation company Landstar, Chief Financial Officer Jim Todd explained to investors that the increase in its insurance and claim costs in 2024 compared with 2023 was “primarily attributable to increased severity on cargo claims, primarily due to cargo theft and fraud in the supply chain.” Trucking company J.B. Hunt mentioned cargo theft more often over the past year than other publicly traded companies in the industry, though it was still light on details. In April 2024, the company’s president of highway services, Bradley Hicks, said technology has “opened new avenues for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft, giving these organized groups access to thousands of loads through our platform.” Hicks added J.B. Hunt is “making some adjustments to harden the security of our system.” Not everyone is raising alarms. C.H. Robinson has 450,000 contracted carriers and handles more than $23 billion in freight annually. The company’s success rate in deterring theft and fraud is “99.999%,” according to Michael Castagnetto, C.H. Robinson’s North American surface transportation president, who oversees cargo theft for the logistics company. “In January, for example, our North American trucking division recorded only two incidents. To put that in perspective: We move over 5 million truckload shipments a year,” Castagnetto told CNBC. Castagnetto said the company has strategies to weed out potential fraudsters, but, he added, “I can’t give you all the details, because we don’t want the bad actors to know how we catch them.” Cargo transportation companies of all sizes are working to address the rise in theft. Julia Fulton, director of corporate communications at TQL, the second-largest freight brokerage firm in the U.S., said the company has invested $4 million in technology and specialized personnel to combat the issue. Nolan Transportation Group said in a statement that protecting customers from cargo theft is a “top priority.” “We take a proactive, data-driven approach, focusing on early detection and prevention to ensure the security of shipments,” Katie Wild, vice president of marketing at Nolan, said in the statement. “We continuously strengthen our carrier onboarding process with additional security measures and increased real-time monitoring to proactively address fraudulent activities and identify suspicious behavior before it escalates.” DAT Freight and Analytics, the online platform widely used by brokers to book shipments, shows where freight is being moved around the country by a carrier and the broker that handled the transaction. Jeff Hopper, the chief marketing officer of DAT, said 90% of all fraud that takes place in the cargo industry is identity theft. He said Prosponsive Logistics “reported the phishing attack to DAT, and we worked with them to address it. We encourage all customers to report suspicious activity so we can respond appropriately.” To combat strategic theft, he said DAT employs a team that spots attempts at illegal activity about a dozen times a day. “We have a whole team of people that that’s all they do all day long — 25 people all day long — is chase these things down and remove those people that we know to be bad actors,” Hopper said. “Our biggest investment that we’re making is to fight that battle and to put the protections in place for our customers so that they don’t have to worry about that.” Targeting criminals before they disrupt the supply chain is the core business for Highway, a security company based in Dallas. “It’s like a virus,” Highway CEO Jordan Graft said in an interview. “So, whenever an industry or a segment becomes infected, it spreads. ... These aren’t just single individual actors deciding to wake up one day and say, ‘I’m going to target freight brokers in the U.S.’ They’re working in groups and cohorts.” Highway itself is also regularly targeted by criminal groups trying to infiltrate the security service and disrupt its ability to flag fraud to clients, it said. The company said its software blocked more than 914,000 fraud attempts last year. It also said 9,829 carrier users from 75 countries tried to get unauthorized access to its platform. The company said it believes those users wanted to steal the identity of legitimate motor carriers. Highway said most of those attempts originated from six countries: India, Mexico, Moldova, Pakistan, Serbia and Uzbekistan. Highway alerts its customers if there’s a change to a company’s phone number, email or address on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s site, where shippers register. “If [hackers] can gain access to the carrier’s information, if they can get control of the carrier’s email inbox or they can phish the carrier to sharing a code with them, then they can change that information,” Graft said. “So, doing it thousands of times a month — it’s relatively easy.” He said the FMCSA needs better support to protect carriers, brokers and shippers, a concern that several brokers shared with CNBC. “I think they are doing the best they can,” Graft said. “You’re asking an under-resourced government agency whose mandate is motor carrier safety to try and attempt to fight a cybercrime attack on behalf of an entire industry.” Chris Burroughs, CEO of the Transportation Intermediaries Association, agreed that it’s been “too easy for these scammers” to hack the FMCSA system. “The fraud has been going on for years. These are well-organized crime rings,” he said. FMCSA spokesman Matt Schuck, in a statement to CNBC, said: “The agency continuously introduces security enhancements and upgrades to help safeguard the commercial motor vehicle industry and the American public. Recent initiatives to combat cargo theft include implementing multi-factor authentication across all FMCSA systems and strengthening security protocols. Additionally, FMCSA is developing a modernized registration system featuring even stronger safeguards and processes.” In response to the surge in cargo theft, U.S. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., along with other lawmakers, in April introduced a bipartisan bill called the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act. The bill would set up a coordination center within the Department of Homeland Security tasked with fighting cargo theft and organized retail crime. “It incorporates the FBI and Homeland Security,” Valadao told CNBC, “and it creates the task force [to] communicate with my local agencies but also amongst themselves so that they can be informed about what’s going on ... around the district or even around the country.” The legislation is pending. On the other side of Congress, the Senate Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Freight, Pipelines, and Safety has taken a particular focus on cargo theft. “In this era of increasing permeability of our southern border, in particular, we’ve seen a lot of criminal elements come through, including those who are engaging in cargo theft,” said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., who chairs the subcommittee. In an interview in his Senate office, Young said the FMCSA is “unable” to identify and remove fraudsters from online shipping systems. “That means a lot in this age of e-commerce, when people depend on this website,” he said, “to identify appropriate shippers and to trust in that information.” The Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate, would give the FMCSA authority to impose civil penalties and other stricter regulations against fraudsters.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA - MAY 3: The Amazon logo is displayed on a sign outside of a sort center on ... More May 3, 2025 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock price is currently trading 20% below its February peak of over $240. This decline followed the imposition of tariffs by President Trump on several of the U.S.'s trading partners. Since then, the government has been actively pursuing new trade agreements, most recently achieving a landmark deal with the UK. The specifics of the U.S.-UK agreement indicate that the U.S.’s baseline 10% tariff is likely to persist for most other trading partners, with minimal exceptions. However, the exemption of steel and aluminum from tariffs in this deal suggests a greater willingness to negotiate sectoral tariffs than previously anticipated. This flexibility in the U.S.-UK deal could also foster some optimism that a trade agreement with China, a crucial factor for companies like Amazon given the significant volume of Chinese goods sold on its platform, could eventually be reached. Although Amazon undoubtedly faces inherent risks that could exert downward pressure on its stock, it's also plausible that some of these potential headwinds are already factored into the current price. Our positive assessment of Amazon’s stock stems from a comparative analysis of its present valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its current and historical financial standing. Our evaluation of Amazon.com across crucial dimensions—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—reveals a robust operating performance and a sound financial condition, as elaborated below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also, see – Google’s $1 Trillion Problem: Stock To Crash 40%? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AMZN stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Amazon.com's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Amazon.com's profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Amazon.com's balance sheet looks strong. AMZN stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Amazon.com Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Amazon.com's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Considering the company’s robust performance across the aforementioned key areas, coupled with a seemingly reasonable valuation of 3.2 times its trailing revenues, we believe that AMZN stock appears to present an attractive investment opportunity. While it looks like there is upside to AMZN stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Post-Future Has Arrived in Argentina—and It Looks Remarkably Like the Past

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Javier Milei’s right-wing government is racking up new debt with the IMF. It’s part of a vicious cycle the country seems unable to break. Buenos Aires—The Basilica de San José de Flores didn’t appear in most guidebooks to Argentina prior to 2013. Located in a working-class neighborhood of Buenos Aires, its current structure was completed in 1883 by the Italian architects Emilio Lombardo and Benito Panuzzi, just off Plaza General Pueyrredón. Although its interior is ornate, with ubiquitous gold leaf, the church is a modest structure, with a small apse and sanctuary, and several dozen rows of well-worn pews stretching across its nave. In the years since Jorge Mario Bergoglio became pope, however, the basilica has become a minor tourist attraction. It was here that Francis attended service during his infancy and adolescence, and here that he ultimately decided to dedicate his life to God. On April 21, hundreds of Argentines packed the church for evening mass and to pay their respects to the newly departed pontiff. Inside, the vestibule was standing room only, and the air was thick with the smells of perfume, body odor, and the faint aroma of incense. The crowd was solemn but unified, holding each other’s hands (or in my case, a finger, while I clutched my notebook and phone) during the recitation of “Our Father.” Outside the church, it was another story entirely. Shortly after the mass’s completion, Argentine Vice President Victoria Villarruel beat a hasty exit down the basilica’s steps with a security detail to loud and increasingly raucous calls of “traitor.” For an instant, it felt as though she might be physically assaulted. A separate brawl would erupt several minutes later, although by then the vice president was long gone. “It’s a tragedy,” reflected Andrea Prado, a 52-year-old sociologist from Buenos Aires province, after the dust-up. “[In Francis], we’ve lost one of the last great humanists and advocates for the poor. Now the far right gets to cover up all the atrocities that it’s committing. This is the best thing that could have happened to [Argentine President Javier] Milei.” Less than 18 months since the self-styled anarcho-capitalist took office, Argentina finds itself in a political, economic, and social torpor. Monthly inflation has fallen sharply, from 25.5 percent in January 2024 to 3.7 percent in March of this year; so has the poverty rate, from 52.9 percent in the first six months of 2024 to 38.9 percent at year’s end. Yet both figures are somewhat misleading. Inflation jumped in early 2024 after a series of tax cuts and unfunded spending measures from the outgoing Peronist government, and then skyrocketed, along with poverty, on the heels of an 18 percent currency devaluation in August 2024 and another 54 percent currency devaluation that Milei announced two days after assuming power. That has set his administration up to harvest some low-hanging fruit; a March report from the Institute of Socioeconomic Statistics and Trends in Córdoba province found that “social indicators continue to show no significant improvement.” Across the country, the most popular television series is an adaptation of H.G. Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López’s classic comic El Eternauta—a sci-fi survival saga set in a post-apocalyptic Buenos Aires. Salaries and pensions have stabilized in dollar terms, but the former has failed to keep pace with inflation, while the latter has lagged well below the breadline. (Last September, the Argentine president used his veto power to nullify a pension increase.) At the same time, the government has taken to violently suppressing its retirees, who protest its draconian austerity measures each Wednesday in front of Congress. Now, after mandating a loan via executive order before a deal was even in place, Milei and Economy Minister Luis Caputo have taken on even more debt with the International Monetary Fund in the form of a $20 billion line of credit. That the IMF is extending an economic lifeline to an outspoken Trump ally at the United States’ behest seems indisputable. More devastating for Argentina and liberal democracies more broadly is that few within a politically exhausted opposition can articulate any plausible alternative to this rigged game—one whose rules are being bent in real time to the cruelty and caprice of a fractious but empowered far-right international. “Thinking about alternatives to this scenario is its own form of trap,” explained Itai Hagman, a congressman representing the city of Buenos Aires and an economic adviser to former Peronist presidential hopeful Juan Grabois. “Milei inherited a complicated macroeconomic and social situation, but it was his own decisions that have left him between a rock and a hard place. If it weren’t for the bloodletting at the beginning of 2024 or the record exchange rate appreciation and depletion of Central Bank reserves in the second half of the year to maintain the value of the peso, the government could have avoided falling into the clutches of the IMF, which is, by definition, a lender of last resort.” On April 12, the IMF Executive Board formally approved an Extended Fund Facility arrangement with Argentina—the 23rd in the nation’s history—with an immediate disbursement of $12.3 billion. The loan, at least in theory, is meant to help address the country’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities, which include negative foreign currency reserves and inflation running at 56 percent annually, while opening the country to international markets in a “timely” fashion, per the IMF. The following Monday, the Milei government lifted a majority of currency restrictions known locally as the cepo. These restrictions are used to protect reserves during periods of instability, but have served as an impediment to foreign investment, with many companies unwilling to navigate the country’s parallel exchange rates. In doing so, the administration has created a new floating scheme in which the dollar can be valued anywhere from 1000 to 1400 pesos. “I don’t totally get why the IMF keeps lending money to Argentina,” Michael Paarlberg, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and Bernie Sanders’s Latin America adviser during the 2020 Democratic primary, told The Nation. “I understand that it’s a major economy, and it would be bad if it went under. But it’s also the worst sovereign debtor in world history. The Fund is a little like Charlie Brown with the football.” “This pattern keeps repeating itself,” he continued. “A conservative gets into office and loads the country up with unsustainable debt. Then the Peronists return to power and either default on the debt or renegotiate it.” Just seven years earlier, during Trump’s first term, then–Argentine President Mauricio Macri secured a $57 billion loan from the IMF—the largest in the institution’s history. At the time, the Fund reasoned that this massive infusion of capital would stabilize the Argentine economy and lay the groundwork for foreign investment. Instead, the country’s GDP shrank 2.6 percent in 2018 and 2 percent in 2019 as the center-right administration implemented a series of IMF-directed austerity measures. Macri served a single, turbulent term, punctuated by multiple general strikes, before he was succeeded by the Peronist Alberto Fernández, who canceled the final $13 billion tranche of the credit line shortly after assuming office. The IMF has hardly needed to attach any strings to its latest loan. Since entering the Casa Rosada, Milei, an acolyte of Austrian economists Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, with an almost religious veneration of fiscal balance, has launched an assault on government spending on a scale that the young coders at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could only fantasize about. (Indeed, as The Nation has previously reported, the Argentine president’s slash-and-burn campaign has served as a model for Elon Musk’s embattled government task force in the United States.) At the beginning of April, the Milei administration had fired or failed to renew the contracts of more than 42,000 workers—approximately 8.4 percent of the government labor force, according to its newly forged Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation. These layoffs have included thousands of workers at the Childhood, Adolescence, and Family Secretariat, which is responsible for administering a range of welfare services. The government has also made steep cuts to public education, while axing programs designed to provide support to women escaping domestic abuse. Along with the marginalized, Milei’s cuts have been especially punishing for the elderly, who have seen medication costs balloon and pensions fail to keep pace with the increased cost of living altogether. A report earlier this year from Argentina’s Center for Political Economy (CEPA, by its Spanish acronym) found that the government spent 19 percent less on pensions in January 2025 than it did in January 2023, during the previous administration. This has led to regular demonstrations that only seem to be intensifying. On March 12, tensions finally boiled over when local football fans lent their support to the retirees’ regular protest. Police in riot gear injured more than 600 and arrested dozens while nearly killing a photographer, Pablo Grillo, who was struck in the head with a tear gas canister. The crackdown, the most violent since the crisis of 2001, has drawn criticism from human rights organizations, including Amnesty International. In May, the government raised the minimum monthly pension by 3.7 percent to just over 366,000 pesos, including a 70,000-peso bonus, or approximately $320. Milei, meanwhile, has seen his approval ratings slump to below 42 percent in the wake of a scandal known locally as “Criptogate” that cost investors in excess of $250 million after he promoted a memecoin on his X feed in February. (Congress has since formed a commission to investigate what the administration knew, and when it knew it.) A report the following month from the pollster Zuban Córdoba & Associates found that 63 percent of Argentines already held a negative view of the IMF. Every Wednesday, Ramon Piriz, 66, makes the 50-kilometer trip from Buenos Aires province to demonstrate in front of Congress. On April 16, he wore an Argentine flag tied around his neck like a cape and carried a sign that read, in Spanish, “I’ve never seen so many brave people without weapons and so many armed cowards.” A retired metallurgical worker and the father of four adult children, Piriz acknowledged that he’s struggling to make ends meet on his government pension, despite receiving more than the minimum monthly allowance. “These salaries are a misery,” he lamented. “A lot of people say that the previous government was a disaster. And it’s true, it was bad. But under Nestor and Cristina [Fernández de Kirchner], salaried employees were always earning one or two points above inflation. We lived with dignity. I should be at home with my grandkids, enjoying my retirement. I’m too old for this.” “We’re still paying the price for Macri’s enormous loan, and now Milei is taking on even more debt,” he added. “We have no idea where that money will go. All we know is that Argentina remains at the mercy of lenders like the IMF.” Elie Mystal Adrianne Wright Gregg Gonsalves Aaron Regunberg That evening, I learned that the Argentine Federal Police had pepper-sprayed a segment of demonstrators that included several retirees. If Piriz is skeptical about the government’s latest arrangement, it’s not without reason. When the IMF engaged the Macri administration in 2018, it trampled its own bylaws by extending a loan that exceeded 50 percent of its lending capacity. That money was not used to build new schools or hospitals or to repair Argentina’s decaying infrastructure. Instead, it served to finance a capital flight from the country—another violation of the IMF’s own terms and conditions. What’s worse, Mauricio Claver-Carone, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank and a onetime official in both the Treasury Department and National Security Council during Trump’s first term, subsequently acknowledged that the line of credit was a favor to one of the president’s former business partners and a right-of-center head of state seeking reelection. Seven years and one Democratic administration later, the IMF’s mask of neutrality has slipped clean off. According to an April 24 report from Bloomberg, the Fund ultimately approved its latest loan to Argentina despite “concerns” from its board of directors about extending yet another line of credit to its single biggest debtor. Prior to the latest deal, the country owed more than $40 billion to the international lender, representing approximately 30 percent of its total debt. In Bloomberg’s telling, some within the board felt the deal was “muscled through by the Fund’s management,” and that the decision was “driven more by politics than policy.” The report additionally noted that the agency may be eager to prove its political utility after the president ordered a review of the United States’ continued participation in international bodies like the IMF. Recent developments would appear to bear out these findings. On April 14, as Trump was ramping up his trade war with China and much of the world, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Buenos Aires to lend his support for the loan and offer praise for Milei’s economic reforms. A little more than a week later, Bessent went one step further, affirming that the United States would extend Argentina an Exchange Stabilization Fund directly if an “external shock” threatened the country’s economic recovery. He added that the United States was trying to “keep from happening what has happened on the African continent” with China. Two days after that, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, made an unusually political statement, urging Argentina to “stay the course” in its midterm elections this November. Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist who previously sided with a Peronist administration during its debt negotiations with the hedge fund BlackRock in 2020, was subsequently seen wearing a chain-saw pin on her lapel—a gift from Deregulation Minister Federico Sturzenegger. (Milei, who campaigned on dismantling the Argentine state, is often seen brandishing a personalized chain saw at rallies and other political events.) The Justicialist Party, which constitutes the largest opposition bloc, has since denounced the IMF director for “electoral interference,” accusing her of encouraging the Argentine people to vote for Milei’s candidates later this year. Georgieva, for her part, maintains that she was speaking to the country’s politicians. “This is a transparently political loan and an unprecedented decision on the part of the Fund,” Juan Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires, told The Nation. “The Milei administration has put out several signs that it is anti-China and pro-Trump, and this is its reward. But it goes beyond that. Argentina has undergone a new experiment in austerity, far beyond anything Macri achieved or even attempted during his term in office. I believe that the IMF and the US are convinced that if this government performs well in the midterms, its radical reforms will gain a new kind of legitimacy.” “The United States has lost its sphere of influence in Latin America,” he continued. “It’s lost control culturally, economically, and politically. No one looks at the US anymore as a beacon of democracy or a city on a hill. All it has are its military bases. There are no more carrots, only sticks. So, when a country subjugates itself to Washington like this, it’s eager to claim victory, even if it’s only symbolic.” Perhaps the remaining question, then, is whether Milei’s gamble on a US empire displaying visible signs of dementia will pay off. Can the IMF’s investment help return Argentina to something resembling economic normalcy? Or is it simply being used to prop up the peso through the next election cycle—after which some form of collapse is all but inevitable? “The fundamentals of Argentina were problematic before, and they remain problematic,” offered Ernesto Calvo, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland and a specialist in Argentina. “Growth is an issue. But I think the most significant challenge for the country is that it has no currency reserves. When the economy picks up, people start to exit by exchanging pesos for dollars. When it falters, people do the same to safeguard what they have. Eventually, not just investors but consumers and producers will run to the dollar. I don’t think anyone has any illusions that things are going to last.” “Will Milei’s policy work?” he asked rhetorically. “If you were to throw a coin a million times, it might stand on its edge once or twice and keep standing. Maybe that happens this time. I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s possible.” Hagman’s assessment is more damning still. “Even if this libertarian experiment ‘succeeds’ on its own terms, it will produce an economy that is profoundly more unequal and doomed to underdevelopment.” On Saturdays, Calle Carlos H. Perette in the shantytown of Villa 31 is lined with vendors selling all manner of goods: secondhand clothing, sneakers, cleaning products, lotions, cast-off children’s toys, some of them worse for wear, and piles upon piles of fruits and vegetables. Officially, the barrio, which is among the poorest in Buenos Aires, is named for Father Carlos Mugica, a Catholic priest and social activist who was assassinated in 1974 by the infamous Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, two years before the military junta took power. Although she has lived in Villa 31 since she was 18, Viviana Rodriguez, now 53, was born and baptized in the Northern province of Jujuy. This presented a problem when she first moved to Buenos Aires. Because these baptisms were often performed in fields and small villages, she lacked the certificate required for confirmation and communion. Fortunately, a local priest was willing to perform all three acts at once. “I didn’t realize it was Bergoglio all those years ago until he died,” Rodriguez told me. “I couldn’t believe it.” When I spoke with Rodriguez in April 2024 for The Nation, she was running a comedor or soup kitchen off Calle Evita. Approximately one year later, the space remains open to the neighborhood, but it exists only as a merendero, where local children can enjoy some cookies and maybe a glass of milk. Of the neighborhood’s five soup kitchens, two have closed, and the three that remain now only offer evening snacks once a week. “They took everything. Everything,” she said of the Milei administration. “Even the small salary we collected to run the comedor.” Rodriguez noted that Villa 31 had changed dramatically over the last year. Her neighbors could no longer rely on the city’s drainage system, paint their homes bright greens and lavenders, or repair the electric cables that hang above the streets like an unruly spider web. All that funding was gone. She had also observed a sharp uptick in the number of families living on the street, as well as a mounting desperation among its residents, several of whom had resorted to cardboard collection and, in some cases, crime. Rodriguez herself acknowledged that she had begun selling empanadas to survive. “I feel as though I’m entering a depression, and I don’t know where to turn,” she said, her voice trembling. “If my debts catch up with me, it’s chaos.” Beneath the Dr. Arturo Umberto Illia highway, which runs along the edge of Villa 31 and connects the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires to the Obelisk downtown, there is a monument to Mugica, or “Padre Nacho” as Rodriguez affectionately called him, replete with a mosaic of the priest praying to the Virgin Mary. As she explained to a group of 30-some-odd volunteer students, it was here that the cura villero delivered mass. (Mugica’s remains were later moved to nearby Cristo Obrero parish at the behest of Bergoglio, then the Archbishop of Buenos Aires.) That afternoon in April, reggaeton blared across the courtyard from an unseen speaker, and two teams of women banged a soccer ball around an adjacent cancha (court). More than 50 years removed from Mugica’s murder, after a dictatorship, a triumphant return to democracy, and a backslide into authoritarianism, with 11 IMF deals in between, Argentina’s future still looked very much like its past.

Title: A once-niche market for secondhand stakes in private funds is booming. What it's like to work in secondaries.

There's one corner of the private investment world benefiting from the Trump bump going bust: Secondaries. "Secondaries" professionals buy stakes in privately held funds from investors looking to cash out early. They have been busy of late, closing a record $162 billion in deals last year, according to asset manager BlackRock. Demand could ratchet up again this year as investors look to raise cash to protect against the financial fallout of some of Trump's policies. "I always joke there aren't any bad times for secondaries," Matthew Roche, a partner at secondaries firm StepStone told BI. "There are some really good times for secondaries, and this is one of them." Uncertainty around Trump's tariffs has slowed already sluggish dealmaking, which is expected to lead to even more private equity investors looking to exit funds that have yet to make distributions. Large investors could also turn to the secondaries market to raise cash in the face of a volatile stock market It's not just tariffs. The endowments of Harvard and Yale are in the process of selling private equity stakes amid a federal crackdown on university funding. While Harvard's sales process began last fall, according to someone with knowledge of the sale, and Yale said it's been in process "for many months," the sales come at a time of growing uncertainty for university finances. As this niche industry takes center stage, it raises questions about the people and firms behind the deals. What firms specialize in secondaries investments? What is the job like, and how does it differ from other financial industry jobs? We spoke to investors, recruiters, and a lawyer with deep secondaries experience to understand what private equity's hottest strategy does every day. The secondary market has existed almost as long as private equity itself, but it was long viewed as a fringe strategy. Nowadays, it's considered a core strategy, making up the bulk of assets for some firms, including French private equity firm Ardian, which boasts the world's largest secondaries platform, north of $97 billion in assets managed. Other key players include Lexington Partners, HarbourVest, and StepStone. It's also become a must-have strategy for any megafund, with Apollo raising $5.4 billion in a debut fund that closed this year. Blackstone, which acquired its secondaries business, Strategic Partners, from Credit Suisse in 2013, is now the second-largest secondaries investor in the world. Goldman Sachs' asset management unit also has a fund. Secondaries investors are a category of private-equity professional, but rather than finding companies to turn around, they are responsible for locating, assessing, and executing private fund transactions, sometimes with the help of investment banks like Evercore or Jefferies. Like other private equity pros, they are using money raised from investors. The secondaries industry raised a record $50 billion in the first three months of the year, according to Preqin. The goal is to buy shares at a discount to their future value. The traditional secondaries deal is led by investors looking to cash out. These deals are known as "LP-led" deals. Increasingly, the industry has been transacting deals on behalf of buyout firm sponsors, known as "GP-led" deals, as more private equity firms struggle to make distributions to impatient investors. The secondaries business is "fast-paced," said Keith Brittain, cohead of Hamilton Lane's $24 billion secondaries platform. It's not high-frequency trading, as deals can take weeks or months from start to finish, but there are many more transactions in secondaries than in the world of corporate buyouts. "Even in a two-year associate program at a traditional large/mega fund buyout, you're lucky if you get to see one deal from start to finish," said Alix Connors, a principal at recruiting firm Opus Advisors. Roche said some incoming associates at StepStone came to the firm for a change of pace "Our recent junior hires appreciate that every day can be different: different sponsors, different sectors, and different companies, with many active deals at all times," Roche said. Holly McCarthy, founder of Opus Advisors, compared the workload to a "sample platter" of "sizes, sectors, and strategies.""You can work on a tech venture deal in the morning, a megafund buyout deal by lunch, and a real estate deal in the afternoon," McCarthy said. Secondaries can also offer a bit more work-life balance than corporate buyout investing. "You have a bit more control over your calendar," McCarthy said. Connors said buyouts can be a bit like "banking 2.0" with a highly demanding, intense workload. Secondaries offer more "predictability," she said, though the recent increase in activity has likely led to longer hours. And while the pay is below that of a buyout fund star, it's not by much. "You might earn slightly less, but the trade-off in deal reps and lifestyle is worth it," McCarthy said. But don't expect that you're going to always be home for dinner. Schedules can still be "inconsistent," said Brittain. "Like many transaction and investment-oriented jobs, you don't always have control of timelines." The secondary investor is focused primarily on financial modeling, research, and closing deals. It's for those who want to underwrite versus meeting with CEOs and running businesses. Brittain said secondary investors who buy a share of a fund must do financial due diligence on the overall fund, including the deals in the fund and the private equity manager. On the GP-led side, diligence is even more thorough. "You're not underwriting 20 assets or 200 assets, you're underwriting one or a small number of companies," Brittain said. You also get a chance to look under the hood of other private equity firms."You have to underwrite the quality of the GP," Brittain said. "Can they buy well? Can they exit well?" Jump to

Title: Finally, the BOAK (after decades), K.M. and Meloni for trains, Greek companies in Turkey, where Ethniki is looking to buy, the Indian competitors of Aegean

Time Published: 2025-05-09T06:28:59Z
Full Content:
Hello, so just to say something positive for a change, after a few decades the BOAK is finally being signed today in Crete with lights and torches (GEK TERNA) in the presence of Mitsotakis—I imagine that since it’s nearby, he’ll also pop over to his house in Chania for a swim. Announcements on Monday Meanwhile, Kyriakos Kyranakis’s visit yesterday at noon to the Italian Deputy Prime Minister Salvini and the inspection he then conducted at Italian railway facilities have a rich backstory, but announcements are expected to be made on Monday by Mitsotakis and Meloni from Palazzo Chigi, at the rescheduled Intergovernmental Conference between the two countries. In any case, Kyranakis’s request to his counterpart was for the Italians to seriously invest in new train sets, while the Italians, in turn, are asking us to invest in the network and in safety standards. The consequences for the Rectors I wrote to you yesterday about the government interventions in the universities, but let me add one more piece of information: the deadline for rectors to submit safety plans for their universities is the end of July. Also, by the end of the year they must have drawn up Internal Regulations, which are essentially the constitutional charter of a university. Rectors who don’t “play ball” will face administrative sanctions, even pay cuts, if they choose to resist, although the Ministry of Education estimates that a common ground will be found. The mission to Turkey Deputy Foreign Minister Tasos Chatzivasileiou has been in Istanbul since yesterday; today he will meet with his counterpart Mehmet Kemal Bozay, and then the two of them will address the Greece–Turkey Business Conference. The organization of the conference is being handled by Enterprise Greece, the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry, SEV, SEVE, and the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, while Mr. Chatzivasileiou is accompanied by top executives from major players in Greek business. Among others, there are representatives from Metlen, Base Metal of the HALCOR group, Europa Aluminium, Swissport, Elbak, Pobuca, and Sky Express. The National Bank, the next step, and the dilemma That the National Bank of Greece is preparing an acquisition move aimed at boosting its revenues in anticipation of further interest rate cuts is well known and already priced in by the market. Efforts in domestic asset management don’t seem to be yielding results. At the same time, glances toward Italy (from all banks) haven’t produced any outcome, as entry into the Italian banking market is neither easy nor straightforward, while the insurance sector—currently in turmoil—is proving more accessible. Ergo and NN appear more receptive, especially the former, which has caught the eye of more than one bank, and Groupama could also be a viable option. One issue complicating matters for the National Bank is the special rights held by the state, namely the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), which remain in place despite the reduction of its stake from 40.4% to 8.39%. The National Bank isn’t worried about whether it will happen or not, because there is a vague initial “OK” from the ESM. However, the relevant legislative provision must be drafted, the ESM must agree to it, and then it must pass through Parliament. The problem is that acquisitions are typically handled within a tight circle of top management—at most three to five executives, such as the CEO, the CFO, etc. But the special rights of the state involve the HCAP board members in the plan, thus widening the circle, since advisors, lawyers, and others are already in the game alongside the bank executives. In mergers and acquisitions, however, you are obliged to act quickly to close the initial deal. In such a case, you take the risk of convincing the special-rights shareholder after the fact, who views the matter from their own (different) perspective and won’t be especially happy if they feel they’ve been ignored. Avramar’s “overcoat” and Amerra’s obstacles We’ve entered May and the sale of Avramar to the Arabs of Aqua Bridge remains pending. The UAE fund and the selling banks initially expected to have a deal by the end of April or early May, but it is said that Amerra Capital, the other shareholder along with Mubadala, is creating obstacles. The American capital initially acquired Andromeda from Global Finance and then, together with Mubadala, bought Nireus and Selonda to form Avramar, the biggest player in Mediterranean aquaculture. Amerra and its executives ran Avramar and drove it onto the rocks, prompting the banks to step in again to find a buyer. And while Aqua Bridge is waiting, Amerra reportedly is setting conditions that are hard to accept. Logically, a solution will be found and it’s said to be near, as all sides want the matter to be concluded smoothly. The good news is that under the new management, things have gotten back on track and Avramar has stabilized, increasing its revenues and improving its metrics. Dividend and forecasts for Aegean Aegean’s stock is steadily climbing, reaching 12-month highs and closing yesterday at €12.70. The airline is benefiting, among other factors, from the positive start to the tourism season and from declining oil prices. Management wants to capitalize on the momentum, which remains positive despite broader international uncertainties, and this year will increase its offered capacity by 1.9 million seats in 2025—a growth rate higher than the European industry average. For the full year, AEGEAN plans to offer 21.5 million seats, with routes spanning 47 countries and 249 destinations. Naturally, there’s also the dividend factor, with Aegean standing out among listed companies by distributing €0.80 per share (€0.76 net), representing a gross yield of over 6%, one of the highest on the board. In a few days, specifically on Tuesday 20/5, the ex-dividend date is set, and payment will begin on 26/5. Aegean’s Indian Competitor And since we are on the topic of Aegean, I should mention that the airline’s management plans to enter the Indian market by the end of 2026 will not be a walk in the park. Aegean’s plans for this particular route will have to contend with the presence of a competitor. The Indian airline IndiGo also intends to start flights to and from Athens in 2026. It is a low-cost carrier based near New Delhi that serves 63% of passenger traffic in India. The company’s CEO, Peter Elbers, is in Athens and even met with Kyriakos Mitsotakis yesterday. IndiGo does not currently operate flights to EU airports, and its first European presence will begin in Athens, with Geneva as a second target. Additionally, note that it expects to take delivery of new A321 aircraft. OPAP Confirms Its Reputation OPAP’s stock is a classic investment choice for those who believe in steady economic growth and expect high dividend returns. One of the characteristics of OPAP’s stock behavior so far is that whenever it “cuts” a dividend, the stock drops for a few sessions, allowing investors to increase their positions at a lower price, only for the stock to regain its momentum shortly afterward. This is exactly what happened last Monday ahead of the distribution of the remaining dividend (€0.80 per share) for 2024. The stock declined, providing an opportunity for those who wanted to invest at a lower price, and as of yesterday, it returned to €19.40 with a market capitalization of €7.2 billion. Bank Guarantees, the Eldorado for Insurance Companies The explosive increase in large public works assignments, aided by the Development Fund, the NSRF, and the Public Investment Program (PIP), has created a demand for the issuance of bank guarantees, which are necessary for taking on these projects. While banks play a leading role in issuing guarantees, recently insurance companies with strong reinsurance backing and the necessary licensing (notable examples include Interamerican and Europa Insurance) have also increased their participation in issuing guarantees. There are also other examples, such as the smaller Euroins Insurance, which belongs to the Eurohold Group. Over the last 7 months, Euroins has changed its management structure, appointed Greek CEO Angeliki Mouratidou, quickly restructured its automobile insurance department—its core activity—and focused on guaranteeing smaller projects, which has boosted turnover by 30% compared to last year, as well as profitability. The New Investment Fund of the HCAP Its name is IIF (Infrastructure & Innovation Fund), and it will be the new specialized subsidiary of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), aimed at investing in key economic sectors of Greece, particularly in infrastructure, innovative businesses, green transition, and digitalization of the economy. Bureaucratic procedures are being finalized, the absorption of the HCAP portfolio was slightly more complicated than initially planned, but by early June, the IIF will begin operations, initially with a capital of €303.5 million, derived from the transfer of EYATH S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Thessaloniki) and EYDAP S.A. (Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Athens) back to the state. There are also plans for new sources of funding. The new IIF will operate as a subsidiary of Growthfund, with independent governance, management, and investment decisions, and BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory (“BlackRock FMA”) will be its strategic advisor. BlackRock FMA has significant experience in investment and asset management, risk management, and technology, as well as extensive knowledge in advising institutional entities on capital markets issues. Trump’s Tariff Policy Benefited Germany’s Exports Since the “day of liberation,” the world has been living in great uncertainty regarding the tariffs that President Trump would eventually impose on imported goods and services in the U.S. As expected, ahead of the potential tariff imposition, the U.S. market rushed to accelerate imports and stock up in order to benefit from the transition period. The first beneficiary of this new situation was… the German economy. Germany’s trade surplus jumped sharply to €21.1 billion in March, from €18 billion in February. This surge was driven by an increase in exports, as businesses rushed to send goods before the expected U.S. tariffs were imposed. German exports rose by 1.1% on a monthly basis, while imports fell by 1.4%. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. was the top destination for German exports, which increased by 2.4% from February, as American buyers accelerated purchases to avoid potential tariff hikes. First Bank Product for Trump’s Tariffs HSBC announced that it had developed a new loan product specifically targeted at U.S. companies struggling to cover the costs of Trump’s tariffs, which have disrupted global supply chains. HSBC is offering working capital to businesses facing pressure on their cash flows due to higher import costs and supply chain disruptions. The bank is also providing support for businesses in managing the immediate financial impacts of tariffs, while they adjust their procurement strategies and re-route their supply chains before passing on costs to consumers. The loan offers flexible repayment terms and a tailored risk assessment, recognizing the heightened uncertainty in global trade. The False Image of Market Indices – 42% of Russell 2000 Companies Are in Losses We daily read and hear about the spectacular rise of indices in Wall Street’s stock markets. However, these indices only reflect a part of the U.S. economic reality, namely the large and powerful (primarily technological) business conglomerates. For smaller-cap stocks, Wall Street is not as generous. The truth is that the new tariff regime, regardless of the final amount, will primarily hurt small-cap companies and small businesses. Futures contracts predict further declines, as investors bet on additional drops in small-cap stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs, in addition to economic slowdown and higher interest rates. Around 42% of companies in the Russell 2000 index are reporting losses, and this percentage is even higher than during the 2008 financial crisis. Explore related questions

Title: Asian stocks are mixed after hopes for China-US talks, trade deal with the UK lift Wall Street

Shares are mixed in Asia as investors pin their hopes on weekend trade talks between China and the U.S. U.S. futures and oil prices logged modest gains HONG KONG -- Shares were mixed in Asia on Friday as investors pinned their hopes on weekend trade talks between China and the U.S. U.S. futures and oil prices logged modest gains. China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1% annual pace in April, down from 12.4% the month before. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20%, however, as President Donald Trump's steep tariff increases took effect. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1% to 22,777.82, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3% to 3,343.38. Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials are due to meet Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland. Asked on Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs on Chinese imports if this weekend’s talks go well, Trump said, “It could be. We’re going to see. Right now, you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145%. So we know it’s coming down.” He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be “substantive.” Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5% to 37,493.65, while the Kospi in Seoul was almost unchanged at 2,578.64. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 8,228.10. Taiwan's Taiex surged 1.7%. U.S. stocks rose Thursday after the United States and United Kingdom announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs between the two countries, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough agreements to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to 5,663.94 for its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6% to 41,368.45, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to 17,928.14. Trump lauded what he called a “maxed-out trade deal” with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on U.K. products but lower taxes on U.K. automobiles in exchange for greater access in the U.K. market for U.S. beef, ethanol and other products. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies also have helped to drive the S&P 500 to within 7.8% of its all-time high set in February after it dropped nearly 20% below the mark a month ago. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras and other public safety equipment, jumped 14.1% after joining the list. It benefited from strong growth for its software and services, and it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 3.7% after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Its stock fell 4.5%. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7% after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of “macroeconomic softness” and because it’s pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonald’s restaurants. The U.S. economy has remained OK so far, with the Federal Reserve saying Wednesday that it still looks to be running at a solid rate underneath the surface. But pessimism has soured sharply among U.S. households because of tariffs, and the fear is that all the uncertainty created by them could be enough to force the economy into a recession. A couple reports on the economy Thursday came in mixed. One said slightly fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. But another said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected at the start of the year. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 26 cents to $60.17 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $63.13 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 145.66 Japanese yen from 145.91 yen. The euro rose to $1.1228 from $1.1220. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Public companies’ first loyalty is to shareholders — why do advertisers give them an easy time?

Best offer yet: Lock in a year of Digiday+ for 35% less. Ends May 16. Best offer yet: Lock in a year of Digiday+ for 35% less. Ends May 16. This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It’s late April/early May, and in any given year of the ad industry’s calendar, that means three concurrent series of events are taking place… in no particular order of importance, they are: In one, those pitching their wares on Madison Avenue make lofty promises about media quality and performance. Meanwhile, in the second series of events, the CEOs and CFOs of such outfits attempt to show Wall Street they are making good on their fiduciary obligations. In the latter, any disconnect between the former two categories is called out by disgruntled customers who can often feel they come off second-best as public companies attempt to juggle the two sets of obligations. The above dynamic played out at Digiday’s Programmatic Marketing Summit (DPMS) earlier this week. So, let’s examine the relevant Q1 results to gain perspective on this weeping and gnashing of teeth. At DPMS (May 5 to 7), Google’s recent U-turn around third-party cookies in Chrome, and its impact on the industry, was the ghost at the feast. Several participants noted how the latest development highlights Google’s lack of a clear plan and its challenges of making everyone happy, as demonstrated by its struggles with global regulators. However, some noted that clients are more focused on their own data and first-party data rather than third-party cookies, with several declining to debate Chrome’s “cookie crunch” further in self-directed sessions. With the upfront season on the horizon, the challenges of CTV and the need for transparency in targeting and measurement were more popular debates, particularly the need for transparency in show-level data to justify the prices on offer. Additionally, the need for (or lack of) differentiation between demand-side platforms and retail media networks was a common sentiment among the 300-plus attendees. Media agency participants engaged in one town hall session, conducted under Chatham House Rules, collectively said, “We come second-best once ad tech and platforms go public, then hidden fees, etc., become more common, and it feels like our trade orgs do nothing.” Simply put, many media agency attendees, particularly those from independent companies, claimed they felt used and abused, as ad tech outfits are increasingly making a play for direct relationships with their clients. This is especially the case as ad budget growth stalls, and publicly traded outfits attempt bid to maintain their stock price. Several town hall participants, including those from agency holding company outfits, expressed a desire to evaluate their DSP partnerships and explore opportunities to shift more spend to more favorable, i.e., transparent, platforms that better align with client needs. However, politics often impedes such desire, with joint business plans and holding company executives’ conflicts of interest cited as common obstacles to genuine game-changing efforts. In this environment, fee structures can escalate, from DSPs and platforms alike. “The amount of value the middlemen, with their DSP and SSP fees, are extracting greatly exceeds the value they’re providing,” said one participant. “Collectively, we’ve all let this middle layer grow; that’s imposing a giant tax with very little in return.” For many, it’s amid this dynamic that obsequious acceptance of platforms’ results is accepted. And, as recent research published by entities such as Adalytics highlights, ad tech and platforms alike require scrutiny, as advertisers’ budgets are not the only things at risk. “All of these companies are public, and if they actually did the right thing to improve and eliminate issues like MFA, which is maybe 20% to 40% of their revenue, then they’re going to lose,” noted another in the town hall. “As a public company, if they stop things like that, then I can’t imagine what would happen, just look at what happens to their price when they can’t show growth.” One participant even suggested that the industry bodies instituted to advocate for their interests may be compromised in this milieu, with several attendees noting the financial support outfits such as Google and Meta provide to entities such as the ANA and IAB, etc. “Anyone [such as a trade group] that’s pushed for open measurement, we’ve found that they [Big Tech platforms] have pushed against it,” observed another town hall participant. “I’ve never seen them come out in support of anything that makes change.” If you feel strongly about any of the issues discussed above, then feel free to get in touch – no PR pitches please. Digiday listened in on the company’s earnings call and spoke with clients, partners and industry insiders to get a read on what’s next — for better or worse. Execs sounded off during the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit on ad tech middlemen, measurement and transparency woes, and the precarious case of pricing.

Title: Chinese companies bought up European ports — and now Brussels is starting to worry

Chinese firms own stakes in about 30 European ports, and that’s raising security concerns. AI generated Text-to-speech Europe is getting twitchy about who owns its ports, with mounting anxiety driven by the outsized footprint of Chinese firms across the bloc’s maritime gateways. Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas on Thursday told industry leaders that Europe’s ports must “reconsider security … and examine foreign presence more carefully.” It was one of the clearest signals yet from Brussels that what once was seen as a benign investment is now starting to look like a security liability. The Commission’s recent defense white paper echoed that concern by floating the idea of stricter controls on foreign ownership of “critical transport infrastructure.” That unease is mirrored in a draft paper from the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, seen by POLITICO, which calls for tougher rules in the upcoming overhaul of the EU’s foreign investment screening regulation. Neither Tzitzikostas nor the S&D mentioned China by name, but the subtext wasn’t exactly subtle. Simon Van Hoeymissen, a researcher at Belgium's Royal Higher Institute for Defense, said the language likely nods to Beijing’s expanding hold over key European ports — from Antwerp-Bruges and Rotterdam to Piraeus in Greece. Chinese giants COSCO and China Merchants, as well as Hong Kong-based Hutchison now hold stakes in more than 30 terminals across the EU. ‍“The reality is clear,” said Ana Miguel Pedro, a Portuguese MEP with the center-right European People's Party. A member of the Parliament’s Seas, Rivers, Islands & Coastal Areas Intergroup, she warned that “foreign state-driven actors like Beijing are operating with a level of coordination and intent that far exceeds the fragmented response of individual countries.” Pedro argued COSCO isn’t behaving like a typical market actor but is taking orders from the Chinese Communist Party. “Its growing presence in ports is not just an economic concern,” she said. “It’s a strategic vulnerability.” The EU is starting to see it that way, too. "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s unofficial support for Russia have only heightened concerns about the security of the EU’s ports," says a recent report from the Warsaw-based Centre for Eastern Studies think tank. One example of the kind of strategic entanglement the EU is now confronting is playing out in Poland, at the Gdynia Container Terminal, where Hutchison has held a stake for over 20 years. That situation could change. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants Chinese-linked companies out of the Panama Canal, Hutchison is negotiating a $23 billion sale of port properties worldwide, including 14 in Europe, to a consortium led by BlackRock and including Mediterranean Shipping Company. However, that deal hit a wall in March after Beijing intervened. What makes Gdynia especially revealing isn’t just the trade it handles — it’s what sits next door: a naval base, a shipyard, and the headquarters of Poland’s elite naval special forces, meaning that whoever runs the terminal holds a front-row seat to European and NATO military logistics and defense operations. Recognizing the strategic significance, the Polish government has listed the terminal as critical infrastructure, meaning the operator has to work closely with the government on security. This high-stakes backdrop sharpens the edge of Pedro’s warning — and underscores why the EU is now reassessing foreign involvement in its ports with renewed urgency. “If a foreign adversary exploits a vulnerability in one European port, it jeopardizes all of us,” she said. “In today’s world, we cannot afford strategic blindness while others act with full visibility and intent.” Europe has built its war-fighting plans on speeding American reinforcements to the front lines. The prospect of that not happening is throwing military mobility plans into disarray. The project aims to make it easier to move troops and equipment between Poland and the Baltic countries.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher after President Trump unveiled a new trade agreement with the U.K. It is the first deal announced since last month's suspension of "reciprocal" tariffs. The agreement will keep the 10% broad tariff in place, but will give the U.K. concessions on automobile and steel industry tariffs in exchange for "increased market access" for U.S. agricultural, industrial, and chemical products in Britain. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% on Thursday. The Dow industrials also closed 0.6% higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.1%. Shares of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) surged 14.1%, gaining the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Thursday. The company, which also provides body cameras and other products for military and law enforcement, posted better-than-expected sales and profits for the first quarter and boosted its full-year guidance. Axon touted strong growth for its software and services segment, highlighting robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) policing systems. Epam Systems (EPAM) also surpassed consensus estimates with its quarterly results, and shares of the digital engineering and cloud-based software provider jumped 12.9%. Growth in IT services revenue, AI-related demand, and strategic partnerships helped underpin the strong performance. EPAM also increased its full-year sales outlook and announced that its current chief revenue officer would take the reins as CEO later this year. Enphase Energy (ENPH) shares advanced 12.2% after the energy technology firm launched a plug-and-play solar energy system in Germany. The new product is designed for users who live in apartments or have limited roof space. It can also be used in off-grid locations such as cabins, campsites, and mobile homes. With Thursday's gains, Enphase stock staged a partial recovery from losses posted late last month after its quarterly results fell short of expectations. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder and other online dating services, sank 9.6%, posting the S&P 500's weakest daily performance. The company reported a year-over-year decline in paying users across its platforms, including the dating sites Hinge and OkCupid. Furthermore, Match said it would cut its workforce by 13% in an effort to cut costs as it navigates challenges related to user engagement. Fortinet (FTNT) shares fell 8.4% in the wake of the cybersecurity firm's quarterly earnings release. Although its first-quarter adjusted profits came in ahead of consensus forecasts, revenue for the period missed the mark, and Fortinet issued underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and the full year. Despite the relatively cautious outlook, Fortinet maintains a strong leadership position in the global firewall market. Shares of drug wholesaler and pharmaceutical solutions provider Cencora (COR) lost 6.8% on Thursday, reversing the strong gains posted by the stock in the prior session following a strong earnings report. Notwithstanding the strong quarterly performance, Cencora noted that it faces challenging growth comparisons for GLP-1 weight-loss products along with softness in clinical trial activity and its specialty logistics business.

Title: Stocks Rise After Trump Announces UK Trade Deal

US stocks rose Thursday after the US and UK announced a deal on trade that would lower some tariffs and restrictions between the two countries. The S&P 500 rose 32.66 points, or 0.6%, to 5,663.94, marking its 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.48 points, or 0.6%, to 41,368.45. The Nasdaq composite rose 189.98 points, or 1.1%, to 17,928.14. Stocks got a boost after President Trump gave potentially encouraging updates on upcoming talks with China, but some of the gains faded late in the day, the AP reports. Bitcoin jumped above $101,000, crude oil prices climbed, and the price of gold eased back as investors felt less need for safety. Treasury yields jumped on bets that more trade deals with other countries would mean the Federal Reserve won't need to cut interest rates as sharply in order to prop up the economy. Stocks and other financial markets have been swinging for weeks with hopes that Trump could reach such deals that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump on Thursday lauded what he called a "maxed-out trade deal" with the United Kingdom, which will keep 10% tariffs on UK products but would lower taxes on Rolls-Royces and other UK automobiles in exchange for greater access in the UK market for US beef, ethanol, and other products.

Asked Thursday whether he would consider lowering tariffs if this weekend's talks between US and Chinese officials go well, Trump said: "It could be. We're going to see. Right now, you can't get any higher. It's at 145. So we know it's coming down." He also said he expects the talks in Switzerland to be "substantive." Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from US companies have also helped to drive the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high set in February. It's back within 7.3% after dropping nearly 20% below the mark a month ago. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras, and other public safety equipment, jumped 14.1% after it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 3.8% after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. Molson Coors, though, warned of uncertainty amid a "volatile" global macroeconomic environment when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 4.5%. Krispy Kreme tumbled 24.7% after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of "macroeconomic softness" and because it's pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonald's restaurants.

HELLO and welcome to The Stranger’s 2025 SIFF Guide! We have returned to our tradition of “attempting to watch every single SIFF film,” and are proud/exhausted to say that we made it through every single screener that was made available to us, so that you, dear reader, could be a little more informed about what rules, what sucks, what is beautiful, and what is incomprehensibly boring. It’s our labor of love, though, to be able to do this. Seattle International Film Festival has brought independent cinema to Seattle for over half a century, and with funding and movie theaters becoming more scarce (please, I beg of you, someone with money, turn the old Broadway Rite Aid back into a theater—the sign is still there and everything!), independent film is more important than ever to celebrate. Below, you’ll find a handy key. UNSCREENED means we weren’t able to obtain a screener by the time of printing, even though we asked a lot, and really nicely. Of the 100-plus we did see, you’ll find we RECOMMEND 32 of them, while there are another 18 we insist you DON’T MISS (threat). But you do you—one person’s “gender-bending lo-fi Frankenstein comedy” is another person’s “supernatural thriller starring a dog,” as they say. So dig in! Rating Key: ★ Recommended Don't Miss Unscreened 1-800-ON-HER-OWN USA, 2024 (78 min), Dir. Dana Flor Ani DiFranco has lived a fascinating life. She’s self-released more than 20 albums, he’s an ardent activist, using her platform to speak out against homophobia, racism, and other inequalities. She’s worked with orgs that make music education accessible to kids, spoken out against predatory major labels, and collaborated with everyone from Prince to Cyndi Lauper. So it’s unfortunate to hear that Dana Flor’s DiFranco documentary 1-800-ON-HER-OWN is “a pedestrian musician documentary” (New York Times) and “a snooze” (The Hollywood Reporter). (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19–20; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING 40 Acres Canada, 2024 (113 min), Dir. R.T. Thorne It’s a classic premise: a pandemic sparks war, famine follows, and resources rule all. By post-apocalyptic standards, the Freeman family farm is thriving until a band of cannibals arrives. The first act is fun, but the cannibals fall flat as soon as we get a good look at them. Instead of standing on their own characterization, they play more like inconsistently styled homages to other horror-movie cannibals. With no background or motivation, it would be easy to miss the allegory to white colonial violence if the movie weren’t called 40 Acres, if the son didn’t sleep under a Fred Hampton poster, if the film didn’t prominently feature a book report on The Proletarian’s Pocketbook, etc. The cannibals feel more like an interruption of the family’s discussions of—rather than part of a story about—race and colonialism. I would have loved to see that movie. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, May 21) BRIGID KENNEDY April Georgia, 2024 (134 min), Dir. Dea Kulumbegashvili After a baby dies during delivery, the father calls the police. The hospital launches an inquest. Nina, the hospital’s leading OBGYN, who delivered the baby, is an expert called in for every complicated birth. But Nina has a secret, which the aggrieved father knows: “I know you give abortions in the villages,” he says. “You’re a murderer.” I assumed a film about abortions in rural Georgia, a country where the procedure is restricted, would be sad. April is scary. It’s a mostly quiet story punctuated by shocking moments, and the menace of masculine control hangs heavy over this film. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, SIFF Film Center May 17) VIVIAN McCALL Auction France, 2024 (91 min), Dir. Pascal Bonitzer Pascal Bonitzer’s Auction, is based on a true story, in which an auctioneer discovers an authentic Egon Schiele painting (exciting!), but learns that it went missing in 1939 after being confiscated by the Nazis (oh no). (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 18) MEGAN SELING Baby Doe USA, 2025 (100 min), Dir. Jessica Earnshaw It’s easy to assume you’d never not know you were pregnant, all the way up until you gave birth. “How would that even happen?” is a question I myself have asked. But, like most assumptions, it’s worth deeper consideration. Gail Ritchey is a mother, grandmother, wife, and devoted church member from a conservative Christian community in rural Ohio who was leading a very ordinary life until police knocked on her door to question her about fetal remains found in 1993, leading to her arrest for murder. Her children and husband (who is the father of her living children, as well as the deceased) are understandably shocked, but stand by her side as they navigate the psychology of pregnancy dissociation and denial, and how aspects like religion, shame, resources, and politics might lead to unimaginable circumstances. Baby Doe is an empathetic look at a very complex topic, something the legal system is rarely equipped to understand or accommodate. It’s heavy stuff, but I do think it’s mind-opening and worth viewing. (AMC Pacific Place May 20, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21) EMILY NOKES ★ The Balconettes France, 2024 (104 min), Dir. Noémie Merlant In Portrait of a Lady on Fire, star Noémie Merlant’s directorial debut, tensions and libidos run high as Marseille is caught in a sweltering heat wave. The titular “Balconettes” are Nicole (Sanda Codreanu), a sexually frustrated novelist; Elise (Merlant), a glamorous actress retreating from the overzealous attentions of her possessive husband; and Ruby (Souhelia Yacoub), a carefree camgirl. When the roommates flirt with the mysterious man on the balcony across from their building, a series of devastating events is set in motion. What starts out as a feminist take on Rear Window (starring Merlant as the consummate Hitchcock blonde) soon shifts into a surrealist revenge fantasy full of bright colors and unapologetic physicality: titties hanging out, farts, orgasms, etc. The effect is something like an episode of Broad City as directed by Pedro Almodóvar. One thing’s for sure: You’ll never look at a rocking chair the same way again. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 19) JULIANNE BELL BAR USA, 2025 (89 min), Dir. Don Hardy It’s said the BAR (Beverage Alcohol Resource) 5-day program is like the PhD of mixology—difficult to pass, expensive to attend, and, according to the attendees, a life-changing experience packed with education and camaraderie. BAR follows a handful of the program’s attendees on their journey through spirit schooling and mastercraft. Yes, there is a certain overproof rizz that comes with some BAR personalities, but the film’s at its best when waxing about “being in the people business.” During a particularly heartfelt diversity workshop, a speaker put it best: “Everything we do…must be truly grounded in making sure that people are, at the very least, respected, considered, thought about, and then hopefully made to feel happy and comfortable.” Cheers to that. (AMC Pacific Place May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Beef Spain, 2025 (85 min), Dir. Ingride Santos Lati is a young Malian woman living with her family in Barcelona. Her father is dead, and her mother wants her to be a good Muslim, but she “only dreams of becoming a famous rapper.” Fuck yes! Sold. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22) MEGAN SELING ★ Beginnings Denmark, 2025 (96 min), Dir. Jeanette Nordahl The complexity of love, the intimacy of caretaking, and the fragility of “normal” come together in a quiet, painful dance in this unflinching Danish drama. Ane and Thomas, on the brink of divorce, seem to hate each other the way only people who love each other can, until Ane’s sudden stroke detonates their unhappy-but-familiar equilibrium. It’s a bleak ordeal through the relentless, pitiless humiliation of failing health and forced dependency. It’s also a captivating, compassionate story of survival and suffering that resists cheap emotional shots, carried by some devastatingly amazing acting. Don’t watch this on a first date… but do watch it. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22–23) FOX ALLISON ★ Between Goodbyes USA, 2024 (96 min), Dir. Jota Mun Mieke is a Danish woman, adopted from South Korea as a baby. Having lost both her adoptive parents, she’s getting to know her birth family, who still reside in Korea. The documentary focuses on that complex, fragile relationship, and we, the viewers, are invited into some uncomfortably intimate, vulnerable moments as they wade through decades of love and heartbreak. Mieke’s parents spent every day of her life loving her and wishing to find her, but they struggle to come to terms with core things like her Danishness and her queerness. The language barrier between them stands in for all the barriers built from regret, time, and distance. The family’s story, though, is far from over. They’ll keep working on their relationships long after the cameras stop rolling. (AMC Pacific Place May 24–25; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Billy Canada (Québec), 2024 (107 min), Dir. Lawrence Côté-Collins It’s an intriguing premise: After her fellow filmmaker, Billy Poulin, goes to prison for murder, Lawrence Côté-Collins stitches together clips from hundreds of hours of Poulin’s personal video footage to form a portrait of sorts of his undiagnosed and untreated schizophrenia. As she updates Poulin on her progress through letters and phone calls, Poulin begins to understand the scope of his illness. But Billy falls frustratingly short as Côté-Collins inserts herself into the narrative—and glosses over Poulin’s victims and the impact of his crimes—in a way that’s more opportunistic than sincere. (SIFF Film Center May 16–17; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING Bitter Gold Chile, 2024 (83 min), Dir. Juan Olea Each day, Pacífico (Francisco Melo) drives his workers from a desolate desert road in Northern Chile to an abandoned mine nearby. He’s searching not only for gold, but a way out for his teenage daughter, Carola (Katalina Sánchez). But after he fires his drunk of an employee, Humberto, everything goes terribly wrong. This tightly plotted, tense neo-Western is about how, as one miner puts it, “when there’s gold, the devil shows.” For clever Carlona, that evil is not only simple greed, but the patriarchal structures that define her dust-covered, hardscrabble world. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, May 22) VIVIAN McCALL ★ BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions USA, 2025 (113 min), Dir. Kahlil Joseph If you like your Blackness bold, creative, eccentric, complex, profound, mind-blowing, thought-provoking (hell, if you just like Blackness), Kahlil Joseph’s “cinematic installation” BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions is your flick. A mixtape of images, histories, and imagined futures, it refuses easy description like it refuses the white gaze. From Du Bois to Raekwon, Million Man March to Ghanaian streets, encyclopedias to encrypted futures—this is Blackness remixed and re-centered. Joseph invites us into a world where history flashes like strobe lights (epileptics beware), and meaning pulses through image, sound, and silence. This isn’t a movie. It’s an experience. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18–19) MARCUS HARRISON GREEN ★ Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Story Ireland, 2024 (100 min), Dir. Sinéad O’Shea Sinéad O’Shea’s new documentary chronicles the life of Irish novelist Edna O’Brien and her ascent from a whimsical child in rural Ireland to a trailblazing writer unafraid to challenge the Roman Catholic attitudes and shame toward sex. Consisting of archival footage and contemporary interviews with O’Brien (just before her passing last year), the film doesn’t just document an interesting subject, but does so with great care and humanity, capturing her fearless spirit and rebellious attitude. Immediately after watching the film, I frantically searched for used copies of The Country Girls trilogy on eBay, so I’d call the movie a success. Some of my favorite Edna-isms in the film include: “Women don’t just need the vote, they need to be armed,” and “I knew I was doing something right by how angry my husband was.” (AMC Pacific Place May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20) AUDREY VANN Blue Sun Palace USA, 2024 (116 min), Dir. Constance Tsang Tsang immediately proves herself a master of tight-space framing in her feature-length debut, ostensibly about a Queens massage parlor but really about so much more. Every bedroom, kitchen, lobby, stairwell, divey restaurant, rooftop, and mini-mall in Blue Sun Palace is immaculately staged. Fluorescent lights become angelic. Brief stutters of the hand after a bad phone call land like daggers. And intimacy, disgust, and grief fly off the screen in sequences that convey mountains of wordless emotion. Tsang’s trust in her cast pays off handsomely, as she lets conversations play out with zero cuts and one camera tucked into a tight room’s quarters. The results—the laughs, the bashfulness, and the stone-eyed stares—feel uniquely and powerfully American, as a Mandarin-fluent cast grapples with identity, homesickness, community, loss, isolation, violence, and shame in ways I haven’t seen in a SIFF film in some time. Bravo. CW: Sexual assault. (Shoreline Community College May 19, AMC Pacific Place May 24) SAM MACHKOVECH Boong India, 2024 (93 min), Dir. Lakshmipriya Devi Coming-of-age film Boong has all of the hallmarks of a first-time director overreaching. Plot lines either resolve abruptly or dangle. Characters don’t get enough room in either dialogue or action to become fully realized. And tone shifts dramatically, jumping from cheekiness to melodrama to heartbreak, often enough to distract viewers from fully connecting to its plot. But Boong also exists as a rare document of border clashes, ethnic conflicts, and family bonding inside the Indian state of Maripur—especially since they completed principal filming mere weeks before a civil war broke out that continues to this day. Thus, the film stands out for its unique and compelling perspective of Northeast India in a real-world zone that’s no longer easy to film. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22, AMC Pacific Place May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH The Botanist China, 2025 (96 min), Dir. Jing Yi The premise of The Botanist seems simple: A 13-year-old boy is raised in a small community by his grandmother and falls in sweet, chaste puppy love with a neighbor girl. But, if the reviews are to be believed at least, the thing that makes this film special is the setting: the northern Chinese province of Xinjiang, just across the border from Kazakhstan. The Hollywood Reporter describes it as “an isolated community…where life goes on as if modern technology never existed,” and Screen Daily said it “runs dry on cohesive narrative.” But they all agree it’s very pretty. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ By Design USA, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Amanda Kramer Camille (Juliette Lewis) becomes enamored of a “stunner” of a chair she can’t afford, to the extent that she wishes she could become it. (“Oh, to be someone’s favorite thing.”) Her wish is granted—her spirit enters the chair, her body left inanimate. The people in her life continue on, monologuing around her limp form (Lewis is great at eyes-open draping), too self-absorbed to notice that she’s not entirely there. Meanwhile, an emotionally distant pianist named Olivier has fallen for the Camille chair; he can’t wait to get away from his vapid art community to spend time with her/it. By Design is surreal, aesthetically interesting (lots of MCM, but the strange lighting and proportions feel more uncanny than twee), and has the deadpan dialogue of a play. Themes include: literal objectification (obvi), tokenism, and maybe something about fetishization and consumerism? Absurdism as emotional truth? When a film is so avant-garde that you can tack almost any deeper interpretation onto it, you have to wonder if there actually is one. Or if you just need to sit with it longer. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES By the Stream South Korea, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Hong Sang-soo For last year’s SIFF roundup, I watched Hong Sang-soo’s In Our Day, in which next to nothing happened: A cat ran off, a poet drank an ill-advised beer, and three women murmured over a box of toiletries. This came as no surprise, because disguised within the mundanity of all Hong’s interpersonal films are lo-fi reflections on the cosmic mysteries of identity, vulnerability, and life itself. In By the Stream, the question is this: “What kind of person do you want to be?… How about saying it through improvised poetry?” One of the film’s quiet strengths lies in its nuanced depiction of artists—a weaver who creates in centimeters-per-hour, an actor who runs a bookshop by the sea. It’s a refreshing reprieve from that annoying film trope of artist-as-wacky-abstract-painter. Expect something akin to Aki Kaurismaki and Eric Rohmer’s storytelling here. People talk, people think, and then the film ends. It leaves you thinking, too. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21) LINDSAY COSTELLO Cat Town, USA USA, 2025 (73 min), Dir. Jonathan Napolitano Terry and Bruce Jenkins are an aging couple who have lived a big, adventurous life together, and in their golden years have converted their property into an elderly cat sanctuary called Cat’s Cradle—a place where older cats who are “out of options” can live out their lives and “be well loved again.” My HEART. Terry likes taking care of the more pragmatic tasks while Bruce creates obstacle courses and fiddles with technology like live-streaming. Birthday parties are thrown, catnip taste tests are conducted, and we get to know some of the retirees. The Jenkinses have a deep reverence for these cats, and the reality of their work is very bittersweet. It’s also very inspiring. We need more folks like these.

Alexandre O. Philippe Swiss-American documentarian Alexandre O. Philippe has a longstanding preoccupation with American cinema history—he’s made films that look deeply at The Exorcist, Alien, and David Lynch’s love affair with The Wizard of Oz. It makes sense, then, that Phillipe would appreciate The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which (hot take incoming) is one of the best American films ever made. Chain Reactions is a straightforward celebration of the film: It launches directly into five interviews, which are interspersed with scream-heavy TCM clips and scenes from related flicks. Stephen King, Karyn Kusama, Takashi Miike, film critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and Patton Oswalt(?!) meditate on TCM’s avant-garde, experimental spirit. (Oswalt has some surprisingly poetic things to say about the film, including comparing its title to “chewing on flesh.”) If you’re interested in Tobe Hooper’s legacy and TCM’s connections to, say, Days of Heaven, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Bergman, or Tarkovsky, you’ll dig this. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, AMC Pacific Place May 17) LINDSAY COSTELLO The Chef & the Daruma Canada, 2024 (90 min), Dir. Mads K. Baekkevold Director Mads K. Baekkevold covers a lot of ground in The Chef & the Daruma. On its surface, it’s about Hidekazu Tojo, one of the most famous sushi chefs in North America (he says he invented the California roll!). But while Tojo tells his story of how he went from cooking out of necessity for his large family in Japan to charging $330 a head for the top-tier Omakase experience at his Vancouver, Canada restaurant, we also learn more about the history of sushi, the region’s long-standing racism against Japanese-Canadians, how a Daruma works, how sake is made, and which contemporary Vancouver chefs, inspired by Tojo, are breaking new barriers in Vancouver’s food scene. I felt like I was watching different vignettes or episodes of a series, more than a well-rounded documentary. Still, it’s a thoughtful and gentle journey, filled with people who appreciate food. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) MEGAN SELING Cloud Japan, 2024 (124 min), Dir. Kiyoshi Kurosawa If ever an action-thriller could be described as “quiet,” Kurosawa’s Cloud fits the bill. (No, not Akira Kurosawa. This is Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the one who made Cure, Pulse, and other moody, often-overlooked J-horror gems.) Cloud’s murky nightmare unfolds in the world of digital dropshipping, which lands ruthless seller Ryôsuke in real-life danger when a band of buyers take issue with his get-rich-quick scheme. The slow, calculated action-thriller communicates in soft steps and hushed tones, broken only by the occasional gunshot beneath overcast—cloudy, even—skies. Cloud treads tricky terrain, though. I won’t spoil the story entirely, but it unravels in a way that strains plausibility. It’s clear the real villain isn’t Ryôsuke, but the suffocating grip of late-stage capitalism. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19, May 25) LINDSAY COSTELLO ★ Coexistence, My Ass! USA, 2025 (95 min), Dir. Amber Fares Coexistence, My Ass! is a documentary about the activist and comedian Noam Schuster-Eliassi, a woman raised from birth to believe Israeli Jews and Palestinians could live in peace. This movie tells the truth that occupation and apartheid led to the genocide in Gaza, and it shows Schuster-Eliassi’s sincere political evolution as she comes to realize that the oppressed cannot coexist with their oppressor, that coexistence is only possible between equals. Certainly, she cares. But for all the talk about checkpoints, about fascism and violence, this is an Israeli story. Glimpsed mostly in shots of iPhones and television screens, the horrors in Gaza and the West Bank feel far away. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) VIVIAN McCALL Color Book USA, 2024 (98 min), Dir. David Fortune Color Book, gorgeously rendered in black and white, tells the struggle of a newly widowed father trying to take his disabled son, Mason, to his baseball game. There is a lot going on here about love, loss, fatherhood, and community, but all I could focus on is how the true villain of this tale is the infrequent, unreliable Atlanta transportation system. As you watch Color Book, take note of how many times the dialogue is simply “Mason!” uttered in every shade of emotion known to man. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25; streaming May 26–June 1) NATHALIE GRAHAM Come Closer Israel, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Tom Nesher Grief is messy, and so is Eden, a young woman reeling from the sudden death of her younger brother. A sexy, hard-partying wild child and avatar of bisexual bad-influence stereotypes, she carves a swath of chaos through the lives of everyone around her. Her discovery of and connection with her brother’s secret girlfriend is an interesting exploration of how shared loss can build bonds in the most surprising places, but the narrative is hindered by a sense that Eden’s exaggeratedly unreliable character was written by PTA parents terrified of their children “partying.” (She’s also got shockingly long, sharp fingernails for someone in a lesbian relationship.) There are poignant moments, to be sure, but I struggled to find anything to care deeply about. (SIFF Film Center May 20, May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Come See Me in the Good Light USA, 2025 (104 min), Dir. Ryan White Winner of Sundance’s Festival Favorite Award, Come See Me in the Good Light is a documentary that follows Colorado’s Poet Laureate Andrea Gibson and their partner Megan Falley after Gibson is diagnosed with ovarian cancer and given two years to live. Variety called it “A luminous portrait of two poets navigating an incurable diagnosis,” and Salon said, “this film delivers hope and goosebumps in equal measure.” Bonus: It’s produced by Brandi Carlile and Tig Notaro. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17–18) MEGAN SELING The Crowd Iran, 2025 (70 min), Dir. Sahand Kabiri Taking place in modern day Tehran, The Crowd tells the story of the planning of a going-away party for a beloved friend by his largely queer community. Over the course of the day, we are shown how this friend group is dealing with the recent death of one of their own, as well as how they navigate the suffocating oppressions of a patriarchal society that views homosexuality as punishable by death. As grim as this all might sound, The Crowd is ultimately a film about platonic love and perseverance, and the celebration of love and community. Shot over the course of 12 days in a playful visual style with collage elements mixed in (personal phone videos, photos, social-media screenshots), The Crowd is a sweet tribute to those leaving and those who have left. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, May 25) MICHAEL McKINNEY Dancing Queen in Hollywood Norway, 2025 (87 min), Dir. Aurora Gossé This movie was definitely not made for me. Yes, I love hip-hop and hip-hop dancing. But the way I enjoy these forms is not at all represented in any part of this film, which has a bunch of Norwegian kids going to LA to do their hip-hop dance thing. The filming is ugly, and the acting is barely above what we find in Kenan & Kel. In the words of Skepta: “That’s not [for] me.” (Shoreline Community College May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19) CHARLES MUDEDE The Dark Crystal with DJ NicFit USA, 1982 (93 min), Dirs. Jim Henson and Frank Oz This screening of Jim Henson and Frank Oz’s beloved puppet-filled fantasy flick is hosted by Cross-Faded Cinema, with DJ NicFit providing a live remixed soundtrack. Sometimes, Cross-Faded screenings include other surprises, too, like balloons or bubbles! There’s no telling what DJ NicFit has in store. (I hope it’s Fizzgig. I really want to hug Fizzgig.) (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 20) MEGAN SELING Dead Lover Canada, 2025 (82 min), Dir. Grace Glowicki SIFF describes Dead Lover as a “bizarre, performance art-coded, gender-bending lo-fi Frankenstein comedy about a lonely gravedigger who will do anything to build the perfect man.” If that intriguing word salad doesn’t pique your interest, consider this: SXSW’s film jury awarded Dead Lover with the NEON Auteur Award, describing it as “a tremendously original film.” (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, AMC Pacific Place May 24) MEGAN SELING Deaf Spain, 2025 (99 min), Dir. Eva Libertad This Spanish drama follows a couple, Ángela, who is deaf, and Héctor, who is hearing, as they prepare to have their first child.

(SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING ★ Diamonds Italy, 2024 (120 min), Dir. Ferzan Özpetek Whoa boy. Diamonds opens with director Ferzan Özpetek hosting a dinner for his 18 favorite actresses (“you are my diamonds!”), asking them to be in his film, which begins a few moments later. This metacinematic device is odd, but fine. That is, until we unnecessarily revisit the director’s table again midway through? The film inside the documentary tells the story of a women-led costume shop set in Rome in the ’70s. The set design and fashion are gorgeous, and everyone’s face is fun to look at, but the script is so incredibly predictable it veers into camp. Which I can get behind! By the time the Özpetek is inserted again, though, it’s clear he needs to center himself so you don’t forget who should be celebrated for celebrating these women. It’s such a brazen move I couldn’t do anything but laugh. Recommended if you’re like, day-buzzed on daiquiris and want a little spectacle (to laugh at, not with). (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24–25) EMILY NOKES Diciannove Italy, 2024 (109 min), Dir. Giovanni Tortorici Director Giovanni Tortorici drew inspiration from his own life while writing his feature-length directorial debut, Diciannove (Nineteen).

(SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 21) MEGAN SELING DJ Ahmet North Macedonia, 2025 (98 min), Dir. Georgi M. Unkovski It’s not easy being 15 in Northern Macedonia, especially for Ahmet, whose little brother, Naim, clams up in the wake of their mother’s death and whose dad obsesses over his fixing his brother’s muteness in all the wrong ways. Ahmet must abandon the usual hallmarks of teenagerdom (going to school, going to forest raves in the middle of the night) to instead schlep the family’s tobacco crop to market and tend to the family’s sheep. But, while diligently tending to the sheep, Ahmet, still a teenage boy, can’t help himself—he falls in love. With a girl trapped in an arranged marriage. Uh oh. The children of DJ Ahmet are trapped by the conservative traditions of their society and by the myopia of their own parents. Only through music—the thing Ahmet and Naim’s late mother cherished—and the slivers of technology they have access to, can the kids connect with each other, themselves, and begin to carve out the lives they want to start living. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24, AMC Pacific Place May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight South Africa, 2024 (98 min), Dir. Embeth Davidtz Film adaptations of successful books can be unpredictable, but Embeth Davidtz’s interpretation of Alexandra Fuller’s critically acclaimed 2001 memoir Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight, about Fuller’s childhood in a white Zimbabwean family after the Rhodesian Bush War, appears to be a success. (Shoreline Community College May 17, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20) MEGAN SELING Drowned Land USA, 2025 (86 min), Dir. Colleen Thurston (Choctaw Nation) It’s easy to think about environmental destruction mostly in big-picture terms. Drowned Land zooms in to tell the story of the Kiamichi River as not just an ecologically important body of water, but an ancestor, a being, a heart. It highlights the throughlines between cultural displacement, oppression of Indigenous people, and exploitation of natural resources. (It’s hard to think about the environment in the abstract when you’re reminded that in 2025, small, discarded communities are plagued by water too contaminated to safely wash dishes in, let alone drink.) The energy industry is a titanic foe, but the Choctaw Nation and other activists are steadfast in fighting back. As Thurston, the filmmaker, says, “This isn’t a redemption story, but it is a story about reclamation.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Drowning Dry Lithuania, 2024 (88 min), Dir. Laurynas Bareiša As with Moon (see my review, also in this guide), Drowning Dry begins with a mixed martial arts competition. But unlike Moon, the movie’s key character, Lukas, wins. And, after celebrating this win, he and his family (wife, son, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, niece) go to a country house by a lake to relax. Slowly, cracks begin to appear. But these are very human cracks. In fact, the film is really a work of philosophical anthropology that’s expressed with two narrative modes: one in which little happens slowly, and one in which a lot happens slowly. When the latter occurs, we are exposed to the terrifying frailty of the human condition. To intensify the experience of the modes, the film employs only diegetic music and naturalistic lighting and shot positions. The result is, for me, the best movie I have so far seen in SIFF. (SIFF Film Center May 17, Shoreline Community College May 22) CHARLES MUDEDE Evergreens USA, 2025 (120 min), Dir. Jared Briley Spokane-based director Jared Briley didn’t take shortcuts when crafting his directorial debut, Evergreens. When Eve and James set out on a road trip through Washington State, we see “heaps of gorgeous shots of Leavenworth, Seattle, Bainbridge, and the forests and waters in between.” It also features music by Damien Jurado and Lacey Brown.

Nabil Ayouch Touda (Nisrin Erradi) is a young woman who lives in a remote part of Morocco and dreams of making it big as a traditional dancer and singer. She has a son who is treated like shit at school because of his disability. And her jobs often expose her to sleazy men and sexual violence. One day, she decides to move to Casablanca to make her dreams come true. The movie, though visually gorgeous and filled richly with music and dancing, ultimately feels unreal. I’m not sure if this was the intention of the director, Nabil Ayouch, but Touda’s journey unfolds and even floats from scene to scene like a fairytale. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22–23) CHARLES MUDEDE Familiar Touch USA, 2024 (91 min), Dir. Sarah Friedland It is no wonder Familiar Touch won “Best Debut Film” at Venice Film Festival and has several other awards under its belt already. Sarah Friedland takes us through a poignant character study of Ruth Goldman (Broadway legend Kathleen Chalfant), who has lived a full life, only to have it scrambled by severe dementia in the end. For anyone who has worried about the effects of dementia on our loved ones, or stayed up late wondering where our parents will spend the rest of their lives, this film hits you straight in the chest. Kathleen Chalfant’s performance is a Master Class through the slow-moving, gorgeous cinematography that is Familiar Touch. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, Shoreline Community College May 25) RACHEL STEVENS Flamingos: Life After the Meteorite Mexico, 2024 (83 min), Dir. Lorenzo Hagerman Flamingos are strange. With their absurdly spindly legs, weird beaks, and cartoon coloring, they look like a bubblegum sculpture whose artist ran out of gum and had to stretch what they had to the point of absurdity. This documentary was clearly made by people who love flamingos. It’s full of gorgeous footage of the birds flying, wading, nesting, incubating, and mating. (Flamingo sex is hilarious, by the way, especially when set to bizarrely sexy music.) The storytelling format is a bit wobbly, and some scenes drag on too long to let the filmmakers use all the music they paid for, but there are plenty of worse things to sit through than an excess of beautiful nature shots. (Pacific Place May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Fly Me to the Moon Hong Kong, 2023 (112 min), Dir. Sasha Chuk Fly Me To The Moon tells the story of a family from mainland China who have just migrated to Hong Kong to make a better life for themselves. Beginning in the late ’90s, the film spans two decades, focusing on the coming of age of two young daughters as they come face to face with the growing pains of the migrant experience. While trying to escape social ostracization from schoolmates through assimilation, the daughers find that things are not any easier at home as their father falls into a pattern of drug use and petty theft and is in and out of jail over the course of their adolescence. The film is a slow meditation on growing up and how we forgive, forget, and forge new paths in light of broken dreams.

Darren Thornton In this Irish remake of the 2008 Italian film Mid-August Lunch, gay author Edward’s (James McArdle) queer coming-of-age novel unexpectedly becomes a viral BookTok hit. Forced to choose between embarking on a book tour in the US or staying home to take care of his ailing mother (Fionnula Flanagan), who has suffered a stroke and can only communicate via iPad text-to-speech, he sabotages himself by avoiding going after what he wants…until his self-serving gay friends unceremoniously dump their mothers at his home so they can abscond to Maspalomas Pride. Edward, Alma, and their three new houseguests form an unlikely found family, resulting in an impromptu road trip to visit a medium. The film doesn’t hit every beat and meanders into predictable territory at times, but it’s got plenty of charm, and Flanagan speaks volumes with her arresting facial expressions without uttering a single word aloud. (Opening Night: Paramount Theater May 15) JULIANNE BELL Free Leonard Peltier USA, 2025 (110 min), Dirs. Jesse Short Bull (Oglala Sioux) and David France In January, directors David France and Jesse Short Bull probably thought they were done with their documentary, Free Leonard Peltier. The Sundance date was set. Then one week before the film’s premiere, President Biden announced he was commuting Peltier’s contentious life sentence. But critics say timing isn’t the only thing that sets this film apart from previous projects—Variety praised it for having a “wider focus” than 1992’s Incident at Oglala, “placing the incidents detailed here in the context of America’s long and shameful history of exploiting, betraying, and even murdering Native people.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 16–June 1) MEGAN SELING ★ Freeing Juanita USA, 2024 (74 min), Dir. Sebastián Lasaosa Rogers In 2014, as immigration to the US from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador skyrocketed, Mexico committed to detaining migrants as they passed through Mexico, rather than allowing them to cross the US border. That same year, Juanita, an indigenous Guatemalan who speaks Maya, not Spanish, was detained by the Mexican government, and confessed to a crime in a language she didn’t speak. Freeing Juanita tells the story of her aunt and uncle, who journeyed a thousand miles from their home in the Guatemalan mountains to advocate for her release. As a human-scale story, it would be striking at any time, but this year? Their vulnerability and determination strike especially deeply.

It opens on a floating raft in an alternative pre-millennium universe. A young sex worker (Annapurna Sriram) is on a raft, telling a psychic (Big Freedia) about how she’s losing her teeth. She’s cursed, the psychic says. And for the low, low price of $1,000 and an innocent lamb, she can break it. So she takes off into this fictional world, called Trashtown, where the cops are Tom of Finland doms and the fancy hotel is called Fancy Hotel. The journey to finding the cash to break the curse is campy, bloody, and full of other bodily fluids. The story will break your heart a little, but it’s worth it.

(SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18) MEGAN SELING The Gloria of your Imagination USA, 2024 (98 min), Dir. Jennifer Reeves The Gloria of your Imagination is either a tough or a really easy sell, depending on who you are. The “dual-projection performance” shares footage from recorded therapy sessions with a 30-year-old single mother in 1964. Gloria, perfectly coiffed, chain-smoking, and toting a wicker pocketbook, shares her anxieties about men, sex, and motherhood with three spectacled dudes, who emit varying levels of douchiness: Gestalt founder Fritz Perls (who calls Gloria “phony” in session), humanistic psychology founder Carl Rogers, and rational emotive behavior therapy founder Albert Ellis. The audience learns that Gloria consented to having the sessions filmed, but not to their being publicly exhibited—which they were, widely. Gloria sues for damages. This reveal causes me to question, then, my complicity in watching the sessions now. After all, The Gloria of your Imagination encourages conclusions that most of us have come to before—the ’60s were an exceptionally sexist time, and modern psychotherapy has its flaws. (SIFF Film Center May 19–20; streaming May 26–June 1) LINDSAY COSTELLO Good Boy USA, 2025 (73 min), Dir. Ben Leonberg It sounds like a gimmick—a supernatural thriller starring a dog—but Good Boy has received some impressive accolades since debuting at SXSW earlier this year. Horror movie homebase Dread Central called it “surprisingly poignant,” the Hollywood Reporter praised the film’s emotional power, and Indiewire gave it an A-, calling Indy the dog’s performance “affecting.” (Spoiler: DoestheDogDie.com promises that Indy survives.) (AMC Pacific Place May 24, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 25) MEGAN SELING Hanami Switzerland, 2024 (96 min), Dir. Denise Fernandes “I think that inside of us, the broken pieces are put together with gold,” says Nana, the central character, in a voiceover in the opening scene. She’s referring to Kintsugi, the Japanese practice of repairing broken pottery with gold powder, highlighting the cracks as a part of its history. But Nana’s speaking from a whole different volcanic island in a whole different ocean: Fogo, Cape Verde. Part coming-of-age story, part surreal fever dream, Hanami follows Nana’s young life, grappling with being left in Cape Verde by her mother, the community that cares for her, and having to decide what “home” actually means to her.

Scandar Copti Oscar-nominated Palestinian director Scandar Copti’s new film gives us an enlightening look into the oppressive everyday lives of a middle-class Arab family living in Israel. Told through a series of vignettes focusing on different members of the family, the film explores how the countries’ divisions affect almost all aspects of their daily lives, from navigating relationships and dating, to dealing with cultural conventions and expectations. How does one find personal agency when all of the external forces around you feel so constricting? (SIFF Film Center May 21, AMC Pacific Place May 22) MICHAEL McKINNEY Happyend Japan, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Neo Sora In Japan’s near future, the authoritarians are in control. They use an impending, once-in-a-century earthquake to justify police crackdowns on immigrants and political dissidents. For Yuta and Kou, two best friends set to soon graduate high school, it’s just daily life. It isn’t until the principal responds to their daring prank and installs a new AI-powered security system called Panopty (get it?) that the country’s crumbling politics become real. Kou sees them one way, Yuta another, threatening their friendship. Happyend is about how people react when the unthinkable happens. Do they decide? Do circumstances of race and class decide for them? Is the answer somewhere in the middle? A film for our political age, Happyend is a must see. (AMC Pacific Place May 22–23) VIVIAN McCALL ★ Heightened Scrutiny USA, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Sam Feder Last year, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio became the first trans attorney to argue before the US Supreme Court in the first big trans-rights case of this second shitty Trump era. The question at the center of US v. Skrmetti: Was the state of Tennessee violating the constitutional rights of transgender kids when it banned puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy to treat gender dysphoria, while allowing doctors to offer the exact same treatments to intersex and cis kids for different medical reasons? Heightened Scrutiny makes the high-as-fuck stakes clear through shots of community meetings and serious interviews with serious people sitting in bare rooms, pizzicato strings plucking away seriously in the background. But it’s also a sweet profile of Strangio, who says arguing a case before the court is not his dream, but a nightmare for a nice normal guy with an albatross of responsibility around his neck. It’s not the most intimate profile—it couldn’t be, Strangio is a high-profile, media-trained lawyer—but Feder’s made a political document worth seeing. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL Home Sweet Home Denmark, 2025 (112 min), Dir. Frelle Petersen Do you want to see the kind of work immigrants in the USA do? Well, watch this movie, which concerns a Danish woman, Sofie (Jette Søndergaard), who, though white, is a home care worker. This film is raw. It doesn’t hide a damn thing. You see it all: caregivers (some of whom are Black) cleaning penises, handingly bodies that are about to fall apart, putting dentures into mouths, and so on. The film is slow (even monotonous) but boy does it tell like it is. It’s hard being an old person in a capitalist (USA, UK, Denmark) society. You are lonely, waiting for death, and completely dependent on caregivers who are often poorly paid immigrants. (AMC Pacific Place May 20–21) CHARLES MUDEDE How to Build a Library Kenya, 2025 (100 min), Dir. Maia Lekow and Christopher King Variety describes How to Build a Library, a documentary by Maia Lekow and Christopher King, as “straightforward, methodical.” It features two Kenyan woman restructuring, over several years (their project began in 2018), a colonial-era library in the heart of their country’s capital, Nairobi. This work of transformation turns out to have numerous difficulties, one of which, not surprisingly, is the stubbornness of the post-colonial government. Anyone who has lived in an English-speaking African country knows the British did a number on the locals. Undoing what Fela Kuti famously called “colonial mentality” is like moving a mountain. (May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21) CHARLES MUDEDE I Am Nevenka Spain, 2024 (112 min), Dir. Icíar Bollaín I Am Nevenka is a biographical drama about Nevenka Fernandez, the plaintiff in Spain’s first case in which a politician was convicted of sexual harassment. Variety called the case “a landmark judicial sentence 15 years before the #MeToo movement.” As a big fan of made-for-TV Lifetime movies, I’m especially intrigued by what movies review magazine Little White Lies had to say about it: “It’s a trashy, tabloid-y film, but it’s a fine one, and a story that still needs to be told again, and again, and again.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, Shoreline Community College May 23) MEGAN SELING Idyllic Netherlands, 2025 (99 min), Dir. Aaron Rookus This dense Dutch film is made with great care and intelligence. At its center is an opera singer, Annika (Eelco Smits), who is facing the nothingness of a death that will soon consume her glamorous life. The heaviness of her situation, which is always in her eyes and her gestures, streams to all the other parts of the film’s sprawling story, which easily could have been a TV series. (AMC Pacific Place May 17–18) CHARLES MUDEDE ★ Into the Wonderwoods France, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Alexis Ducord and Vincent Paronnaud You know when you have a dream where there is one big mission, but seemingly hundreds of side-plots with too many characters to count? And then you wake up and you’re like, “That was AWESOME.” Into the Wonderwoods is that fever-dream. This animated film has been translated from French to English, but you know the French are freaky AF, and it shows in this adventure of a 10-year-old boy, Angelo, who gets separated from his family and travels through a forest filled with ogres, robots, magic landscapes, and more. His imagination helps him brave the elements and even join a resistance. Into the Wonderwoods is for children ages 8 and above, and the young at heart. (Though I let my 5-year-old watch it with me and she hasn’t stopped talking about it since.) (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, Shoreline Community College May 18) RACHEL STEVENS Invention USA, 2024 (72 min), Dir. Courtney Stephens I love a movie that refuses to have a genre. Invention blends fiction and autobiographical documentary to something warm and a little bit magical. In this “meta fiction,” co-writers Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez create a fictional version of the immediate aftermath of Hernandez’s father’s death, but intersplices real found VHS footage of her own father. It’s messy, but so is grief. (AMC Pacific Place May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER Jean Cocteau USA, 2024 (94 min), Dir. Lisa Immordino Vreeland Jean Cocteau is a perfect example of a documentary with a captivating subject, but unfortunately, bland filmmaking. While I appreciated that the film let the iconic Renaissance man speak for himself—weaving together interviews, journals, and clips from his films—narrative gaps were filled by walls of text that I found clunky and uninspiring. However, this was also the first biography of Cocteau I’ve seen that gives adequate attention to his identity as a gay man and love affairs with collaborators like Jean Marais, Raymond Radiguet, and Édouard Dermit. The film also touched on his controversial friendship with Nazi sculptor Arno Breker, but lacked a stance, quoting Cocteau’s belief that friendship is more important than politics. As the credits rolled, I wasn’t particularly surprised to see that the film was funded in part by fashion giant Chanel, whose founder, Coco (a known Nazi sympathizer), designed costumes for many of Cocteau’s stage productions. (AMC Pacific Place May 19, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) AUDREY VANN John Cranko Germany, 2024 (135 min), Dir. Joachim Lang Without a doubt, John Cranko is no Amadeus. Nevertheless, it’s not half bad. The reason for this biopic’s success is found in the actor who plays John Cranko: Sam Riley. Most of us know Riley from another biopic, Control (he plays somber Ian Curtis). In this title role, he is the legendary and complicated South African choreographer who ran Stuttgart Ballet in the 1960s, John Cranko. Though highly entertaining, John Cranko offers nothing new. It has, like most biopics of its kind, scenes of the genius in a mess, the genius struggling with the establishment and lazy dancers, and, of course, the genius smoking like a chimney as he gives inspiring speeches that show why he is a genius.

Aruan Anartay After several years abroad, young scientist Darkhan returns home to Kazakhstan with his girlfriend Elena, and they join his enigmatic grandfather on a trip to the plains of their ancestral homeland. In the opening credits, we learn the title refers to a traditional Kazakh mourning song, and that sense of quiet grief lingers throughout this sparse, poetic journey. Joqtau explores family legacy and cultural erosion, and the film style shifts fluidly between the intimacy of a family dinner and the observational feel of a documentary. As they move through the countryside, Elena remains a quiet observer as Darkhan slowly reconnects with his roots. Joqtau is low on plot but high on vibe, and it leaves its somber atmosphere behind after it ends.

Michael Jonathan Rare is the coming-of-age wartime film that successfully combines wildly disparate tones, like sweetness and brutality, or humor and tension. Ka Whawhai Tonu’s unflinching look at the 19th-century New Zealand Wars is an astonishing example of consistent tone and spirit in a film about colonialist travesties. The film opens on a Māori tribe capturing a half-Māori, half-European teen boy ahead of a siege by European forces and mistreating him. A teen girl in the encampment, herself facing similar adult maltreatment, finds ways to help the boy, thus sealing their friendship—while also stoking tensions among leaders. There are no winners in this conflict as viewed through younger eyes (“adults made me something I’m not, for an adult’s war”), but through this film’s genuine anguish comes a remarkable document of the human spirit at its best—and its worst. Temuera Morrison has a hell of a performance as equal parts diplomat, commander, and elder, while Paku Fernandez’s teenage vulnerability and tenacity put the beautifully shot film over the top.

Anas Saeed, Rawia Alhag, Brahim Snoopy, Timeea Mohamed Ahmed, and Phil Cox In Khartoum, five directors collaborate with five refugees from different backgrounds to reenact their life-changing experiences in the Sudanese Civil War. Sometimes their stories are supported by props and CGI renderings of the places they’re describing; other times, they’re acted out in front of blank green screens with a boom mic dipping into frame. Either way, the subjects take turns acting in each other’s stories, positioned and fed lines as they go, often embodying people who had drastically different experiences than their own. It’s a collective effort with something to say about community, justice, and storytelling. Khartoum is special. (AMC Pacific Place May 19, May 21) BRIGID KENNEDY The Kingdom France, 2024 (108 min), Dir. Julien Colonna Sadly, this is not the 2007 action thriller starring Jamie Foxx! Instead, it sounds much more intense. SIFF’s provided description reads: “When an underground war breaks out between nationalist groups and crime families, a Corsican mobster and his daughter must go on the run, bringing them closer together and drawing her into his world.” Don’t let that scare you away! Julien Colonna’s 2024 Kingdom currently has a 100 percent critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 14 reviews from outlets including IndieWire and Variety, while Foxx’s Kingdom is sitting not-so-pretty at 51 percent. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, May 23) MEGAN SELING ★ Know Her Name Canada, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Zainab Muse Women were powerful in early Hollywood, and what happened will not surprise you. Money (and men) changed everything. In the freewheeling years before California lured the film industry west with tax breaks, it didn’t matter as much who was on set writing the scripts, running the cameras, or even cutting the checks (Alice Guy-Blaché made 1,000 films and ran her Solex studios in New Jersey—a “fine example of what a woman can do if given a square chance in life,” according to the Motion Picture News in 1911.) Then men took the whole thing over and still haven’t let go, more than 100 years later, enough time for us to nearly forget about pioneers like Guy-Blaché. Countless other women won’t even get that chance—75 to 90 percent of American films shot before 1929 are lost to time. Exactly why women were written out of history is a complex question, but it’s clear those opportunities never came back. Know Her Name does what only a good documentary can, unspooling the historical record so slowly and thoughtfully that it’s hard to pinpoint when a rage started smoldering in my gut. By the time the credits rolled, I didn’t just feel angry, I felt cheated out of great films that never were. (Shoreline Community College May 23, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL The Librarians USA, 2025 (88 min), Dir. Kim A. Snyder Just six minutes into The Librarians, a librarian starts to cry. That’s how bad it is out there for those working in states such as Texas and Florida, where conservatives are calling for the removal of hundreds of books. While book banning is nothing new, it has grown to unprecedented levels in recent years, largely due to the right-wing organization Moms for Liberty. But the librarians aren’t having it. They’re fighting back. They’re defending their duty to ensure their school and public libraries are inclusive, welcoming spaces, and it’s costing them their jobs, their relationships, and, in some cases, their safety. But lest people think this all comes down to ethics and morality, The Librarians does a great job digging a little deeper to show that all the fighting, screaming, and literal book burning ultimately come down to one thing: money. You’ll leave the theater wanting to simultaneously hug a librarian and burn the world to the ground. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16–17) MEGAN SELING Little Red Sweet Hong Kong, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Vincent Chow A young Chinese woman gives up her dreams of being a flight attendant and returns home to help run the family’s dessert shop after her mother suffers a stroke. Despite her sacrifices, her dad won’t let her in the kitchen to help make their famous, secret recipe red bean soup. Drama! One reviewer called it “undercooked.” One review we translated from Chinese reads: “It seems to be cleaned with bleach. It’s a clean movie, a movie without life.” (AMC Pacific Place May 21, Shoreline Community College May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM LUZ Hong Kong, 2025 (102 min), Dir. Flora Lau Amid neon-streaked Chongqing’s nightlife scene, karaoke bar employee Wei (Guo Xiaodong) attempts to contact his estranged daughter Fa (Deng Enxi). Meanwhile, Hong Kong gallerist Ren (Sandrine Pinna) reconnects with her stepmother Sabine (the iconic Isabelle Huppert), who devotes her time to the Parisian art world and was recently diagnosed with a fatal aneurysm. One day, Wei and Ren cross paths in an open-world VR game called Luz, in which players navigate a dreamlike cyberpunk setting on a quest to find a shimmering, ethereal deer. The film has mesmerizing visuals and raises interesting questions about art, interpersonal connection in the digital age, and the blurred lines between artifice and reality, but unfortunately lacks the emotional substance to back it up. Nevertheless, Huppert delivers a standout performance as always, and it’s a joy to watch her vaping and dancing in the face of death. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20, AMC Pacific Place May 22) JULIANNE BELL ★ Manas Brazil, Portugal, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Marianna Brennand Based on director Marianna Brennand’s decade of research into the sexual abuse of children and teenagers in the Amazon rainforest, Manas is as devastating as it sounds. The drama follows 13-year-old Tielle through a world where abuse is the norm of girlhood. The film moves slowly, lingering over every facial expression and piece of the story, featuring beautifully designed shots amidst the ugliness of its subject matter. At one particularly gutting moment, Tielle’s mother tells her, “there’s no use trying to change some things.” And yet, Tielle attempts to alter the generational script, as does this film, by creating this unflinching portrait of such a difficult topic. (SIFF Film Center May 16, May 18) ROBIN EDWARDS Meeting with Pol Pot France, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Rithy Panh If longtime Cambodian director Rithy Panh is new to you, and you’re horny for accolades, know this: His 1994 film Rice People was the first Cambodian film to be submitted for an Oscar and several of his films have shown at Cannes, including 2003’s S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine, which won Prix François Chalais, and his 2013 documentary The Missing Picture which took home the Un Certain Regard title. So chances are, Meeting with Pol Pot, which is partly based on the book When the War Was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution by Elizabeth Becker, will not be bad. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, May 20) MEGAN SELING ★ Monarch City USA, 2025 (70 min), Dir. Titus Richard Monarch City is of great importance to the history of this region’s cinema, because it is Paul Eenhoorn’s last film. For those not familiar with this actor, who came from Australia and wound up in Seattle, he spent the last part of his life starring or appearing in a number of local indie films before dying in his sleep in Tacoma in 2022. His moment, however, arrived in 2014 with the film Land Ho!, which made a splash at Sundance, and concerned two elderly men enjoying all that Iceland has to offer. Monarch City is set in a town outside of Seattle. Eenhoorn plays Sam, a broken man in a broken town (alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, guns, dead dives, beat-up pickup trucks). Sam recites poetry about arriving at other shores. He smokes and drinks and carries a gun. And he ends the film with a meditation on death. Goodnight, Eenhoorn. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Mongrels Canada, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Jerome Yoo If you consider yourself a dog lover, best beware that a bunch of them brutally bite the dust in this visually poetic, though ultimately scattered, directorial debut. Mongrels is told in three parts and centered on a Korean father tasked with killing dogs in the woods, his troubled son, and his imaginative daughter still trying to remain connected to her absent mother. The film follows the family as they begin to make a new life in small-town Canada. It thrives when it lets us sit with the more ephemeral sense of loss, though it eventually becomes overly literal. As one part fades into the next, hitting plenty of familiar coming-of-age beats, the portrait it tries to paint never quite comes into focus as beautifully as the visuals do. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, AMC Pacific Place May 17) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ Monk in Pieces USA, 2025 (95 min), Dir. Billy Shebar and David Roberts The answer to everything is just to keep making art long enough that people finally get it and pronounce you a genius. At least that’s what I learned from this loving and insightful portrayal of avant-garde musician, director, and lifelong performance artist Meredith Monk. The documentary presents Monk’s work and life in a greatest-hits mosaic, featuring interviews with David Byrne, Philip Glass, and Björk. I especially loved seeing the evolution of sexist early reviewers calling her work narcissistic, self-centered (isn’t most art self-centered?), and, my favorite, “it made my cats bite each other,” to critics finally recognizing her impact and singular vision. All the while, she continued making delightfully freaky operas that feel plucked from another dimension in the same NYC warehouse she’s lived in since the ’70s with her pet turtle, Neutron. I dream of a Seattle where artists can make our work well into our 80s, too. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16–17) ROBIN EDWARDS ★ Moon Austria, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Kurdwin Ayub After losing a big fight, a famous and top-rated Austrian martial arts fighter, Sarah (Florentina Holzinger), retires. But what is she to do with the rest of her life? She is still young and has a lot of time on her hands. Out of the blue, a rich Jordanian offers her a lot of money to train his sisters, who, he claims, have taken an interest in martial arts. It’s big in Jordan. Sara accepts the offer, flies to Amman, gets set up in a fancy hotel, and soon after is introduced to the sisters, who live in a gaudy mansion on the outskirts of the city. The first training session, however, goes badly. So does the next one. Eventually, it becomes obvious that something is profoundly wrong with the sisters, their brother, his bodyguards, and the mansion. The film becomes a thriller. What is really going on here? Is Sarah’s life in danger? Moon is great until the last 10 minutes. (SIFF Film Center May 22, AMC Pacific Place May 23) CHARLES MUDEDE The Nature of Invisible Things Brazil, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Rafaela Camelo There’s something so compelling about the way children make friends: trading secrets, building mythology, finding your own language of play. In The Nature of Invisible Things, that friendship unfolds between two young girls in a hospital—one spending her summer vacation with her mother, a nurse, and the other waiting for her granny to get well. The film passes back and forth between the stark realities of the hospital, and the surreal imaginations of children trying to make sense of the world around them. It has moments of being genuinely unsettling (it is a hospital after all) but most of the film is a frank portrait of two girls, their two moms, and how they all seek out joy.

Lanfia Wal When was the last time you saw a lo-fi, neon action movie with a virtually all-Black cast, knock-off Michael Jackson, and a scene pulled straight out of Street Fighter? If your answer is “never” (like mine was), New Jack Fury is your chance. It starts with someone getting hit with a dirty 18-inch dildo, and it ends with a dance off, swords, and betrayal. Watch this one, if only because you won’t see anything else like this self-aware, chaotic dreamscape for a long time. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, Shoreline Community College May 18; streaming May 26–June 1) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER The New Year That Never Came Romania, 2024 (138 min), Dir. Bogdan Mureşanu On one hand, The New Year That Never Came is an award-winning and critically acclaimed film about six lives intersecting on the streets of Romania on December 20, 1989. Their stories unfold throughout the day while Nicolae Ceaușescu’s communist regime famously falls. But with a movie poster that highlights the ensemble cast, I can’t help but imagine it as some kind of Love, Actually or New Year’s Eve rom-com starring Zac Efron and Katherine Heigl… but with a presidential execution at the end. I’d watch the fuck out of that. (AMC Pacific Place May 18–19; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING Odd Fish Iceland, 2024 (104 min), Dir. Snævar Sölvason Odd Fish is Iceland’s first film about a trans woman. This is the story: Two old friends who run a cozy little restaurant in a lovely little town that attracts tourists from Norway and other such parts are about to finally get filthy rich because a corporation wants to bring visitors all year round. The restaurant can expand; the town can grow. What more do you want? After the good economic news, one of the restaurant’s owners and cook, Björn, comes out as a woman. This coming out was instigated by her father’s death. The other owner, Hjalti, is smashed by this transition. He is already homophobic. How can he work with a trans woman? Though this part of the film is important, it has no surprises. And what really amazes you are the wide shots that capture the cold and treeless beauty of this island from another planet. (AMC Pacific Place May 21–22) CHARLES MUDEDE Paul Anka: His Way USA, 2024 (99 min), Dir. John Maggio I am furious that we were denied a screener for Paul Anka: His Way. Paul Anka is fascinating! (Shoreline Community College May 23, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 25) MEGAN SELING ★ Paying For It Canada, 2024 (85 min), Dir. Sook-Yin Lee I was pleasantly surprised by Paying for It, Sook-Yin Lee’s adaptation of her ex-boyfriend Chester Brown’s autobiographical graphic novel of the same name. The story is based on the couple’s real-life breakup, in which Lee searches for new emotional connections with other men while Brown altogether ditches the idea of romantic love and visits sex workers whenever he’s feeling horny. Paying for It could’ve easily devolved into a messy and overwrought hot take on the ethics of monogamy and the morality of sex work. Instead, it’s a realistic and thoughtfully paced portrayal of two people maneuvering new territory, both as individuals and as a bonded pair, in order to find what version of love and companionship makes them happiest. What’s right for them may not be right for everyone (or anyone) else, and that’s okay. It’s actually very sweet. Bonus: Director Sook-Yin Lee is scheduled to attend the screenings. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18) MEGAN SELING ★ Raptures Sweden, 2025 (108 min), Dir. Jon Blåhed Shot beautifully in a bucolic Scandinavia, Raptures tells the story of Rakel, a traditional and devout Christian living in a small Swedish village in the 1930s. As her increasingly delusional alcoholic husband, Teodor, breaks away from the church to start preaching his own messages that come directly from God (red! flag!), she must navigate her own conflicting feelings and beliefs as the anxieties of a looming world war simmer in the background. Will a large crystal arc show up to save the believers? Is a Teodor sex party in the sectarian cult house really part of God’s plan? It’s Ingmar Bergman meets Midsommar, and it’s the first feature film ever with a main dialogue in the minority language Meänkieli. It’s also brilliantly acted and totally worth watching. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23–24) MICHAEL McKINNEY ★ Ready or Not Ireland, 2025 (83 min), Dir. Claire Frances Byrne Dublin, 1998: A summer of firsts for Katie (Ruby Conway Dunne) and her friends. First kisses. First drinks. Realizing for the first time that the world, and boys, mean to eat up teenage girls. Conway Dunne and Molly Byrne, who plays her best friend Danni in the film, teeter believably on the edge of adolescence. When nobody is watching, they’re playful kids. At school and parties, they’re kids trying their best at being adults. Even though I didn’t care for all the voiceover (of the “record scratch, isn’t my life soo crazy” variety) or that the script seemed to have left what should have been subtext in big bold letters, I liked this movie because those kids acted like real kids—swearing, crying, and handling everything very poorly. I just had to know if they’d be okay in the end. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21–22) VIVIAN McCALL Remaining Native USA, 2025 (87 min), Paige Bethmann Teenage cross-country phenom Ku Stevens aspires to leave his small Nevada town for college, but along the way, he wrestles with shadows of his Indigenous family’s American experience. At its best, this documentary offers an unblinking look at physical and cultural violence perpetrated by white Americans, all while humanely framing Native Americans’ continuing efforts to grieve, process, and persevere. The film’s strongest moments—particularly Stevens retracing his great-grandfather’s 50-mile running escape from a brutal boarding school—are hampered by poor pacing and editing decisions. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Riefenstahl Germany, 2024 (116 min), Dir. Andres Veiel For decades, people have debated Leni Riefenstahl’s films. Was her Hitler-sanctioned documentary, The Triumph of the Will, historic filmmaking or Nazi propaganda? While my inclination is to roll my eyes and say, “Bitch was a Nazi, let her rot,” I’m intrigued by Andres Veiel’s documentary, Riefenstahl, which The Hollywood Reporter says highlights the “‘seductive nature of fascism’ both the 1930 variety and the updated versions of today.” (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 20, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22) MEGAN SELING The Safe House Switzerland, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Lionel Baier Revolution! 1960s Paris! A Tenenbaum-esque multigenerational residence! So much to love about this film, right? Mais non, The Safe House falls flat. Taking place during the social uprisings in May 1968, France, the film focuses on the perspectives of a halfway eccentric middle-class family existing mostly domestically while violence ensues out in the streets. The film makes little (if any) real commentary on the politics of the time, and lacks any real emotion via family dynamics. And while I personally believe that a film can survive—if not thrive—on style over substance with the proper imagination, The Safe House is tepid at best in its art direction as well. The “quirky” visual and editing tricks are tired, and the voiceover muddies rather than helps the narrative along. While there are wisps of Tati and Godard in the DNA of this film, you are better off just visiting those directors’ films. Or Bertolucci’s The Dreamers, which is also about the May ’68 uprisings, but good. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, Shoreline Community College May 22) MICHAEL McKINNEY ★ Sally USA, 2025 (103 min), Dir. Cristina Costantini It wasn’t until seeing Sally that I realized flying into space may be one of the less impressive accomplishments on astronaut Sally Ride’s resume. Because you know what’s harder than getting four degrees at Stanford, pushing through years of grueling physical training, and getting taken seriously as one of fewer than a dozen women at NASA in the 1980s? Bearing the brunt of the world’s misogyny while hiding the fact that you’re gay, even from your closest friends and family for fear of how it could impact your hard-earned career. In Sally, Ride’s long-time partner Tam O’Shaughnessy introduces us to the side of Ride that Ride was too scared to share while she was alive. We get to meet the complex, vulnerable woman behind the confident public figure. It’s as inspiring as you’d expect a documentary about a trailblazer to be, but with a hefty, bittersweet, even heartbreaking, dose of reality. (Shoreline Community College May 21, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22) MEGAN SELING Salsa Lives Colombia, 2025 (101 min), Dir. Juan Carvajal Did you know salsa, the dance, not the sauce, was born in New York City? Existing rhythms in Cuba, Cuba Son and Afro-Cuban rumba merged with American jazz to create the hip-swiveling dance. Since its Big Apple inception, salsa has spread across the world. But, nowhere is it more popular these days than in Cali, Colombia. Salsa Lives traces that spicy history in what’s supposed to be a vibrant—NOT MILD—experience.

Stephen Quay and Timothy Quay To the outside world, in his home country, Józef’s father is dead. But inside the walls of this dingy, remote sanatorium, he is alive. Sort of. His death simply hasn’t arrived yet. Time is different here. It lags. It stretches, skitters, and loops. But that’s grief for you, rendered here in beautiful and surreal stop motion. I liked this movie enough to buy the short story collection it was based on—Polish Jewish writer Bruno Schulz’s meditation on his father’s death (published five years before the Gestapo shot the writer dead). But I’m patient. I enjoy wondering what’s going on. If you can’t stand ambiguity, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass may have you checking the sign of your watch. Stephen and Timothy Quay fans will know the film is a sequel of sorts—their most well-known work is 1986’s Street of Crocodiles, another Schulz adaptation. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18, May 23) VIVIAN McCALL Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers USA, 1972 (82 min), Dir. Robert J. Kaplan If you are a fan of any of the following, then Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers is a must-watch for you: the early films of John Waters, vanilla ice-cream cones, ostrich-feather boas, and Buster Keaton-style physical comedy. Robert J. Kaplan (whose only other directorial credit is the pornographic Jaws spoof Gums) directs this long-lost camp masterpiece starring Warhol superstar and transgender icon Holly Woodlawn as she flees her boring Kansas upbringing to make it as an actress in New York City. Along the way, she meets an eccentric cast of characters, including a sailor-mouthed nun, misandrist twin sisters, and a revered lounge singer named Mary Poppins (played by fellow Warhol superstar Tally Brown). I am so pleased to see this film receive a snazzy restoration and a proper theater screening—I predict a Criterion release is on the horizon. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24) AUDREY VANN Seeds USA, 2025 (122 min), Dir. Brittany Shyne Director and cinematographer Shyne spent nine years watching and listening to Black farmers in rural Georgia, and the end result is impossibly beautiful. Like any documentary, you see these families through her eyes, but from the families, you rarely feel the self-consciousness that comes from being watched—which just reveals how much time and patience Shyne put into this project. Shot all in black and white, the film is quiet, allowing for the long, languid pauses of rural life. But it only takes a few scenes to fully pull you in. This film won Sundance’s best documentary for a reason. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ She’s the He USA, 2025 (81 min), Dir. Siobhan McCarthy This queer teen comedy starts, like many teen comedies do, with a harebrained deception scheme. Playing on conservative hysteria surrounding all-gender bathrooms, She’s the He finds best friends Ethan (Misha Osherovich) and Alex (Nico Carney) pretending to be trans to enter the girls’ locker room at school, leading Ethan to the realization that she actually is trans. The quick-witted film with a majority trans cast checks off the high school movie tropes, including makeover scenes, a blooper reel, and raunchy jokes, while creating tender moments where Osherovich’s full-hearted performance makes the coming-out story shine. It’s a lot of fun! And the costumes were so cool, I went back to the credits to track down who the designer was (Leah Morrison) and creepily requested her private Instagram. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19, AMC Pacific Place May 20) ROBIN EDWARDS ★ Shepherds Canada (Québec), 2025 (113 min), Dir. Sophie Deraspe In this funny, existential drama, a burned-out Québécois marketing executive sends a fuck-off email to his bosses, gives away his possessions, maxes out his credit cards, and flees to the south of France. Dreaming of a simpler life, he wants to become a shepherd. He clumsily introduces himself to local farmers who immediately clock him as a privileged city boy with no clue what he’s doing. He stumbles from one farm to the next, debating work, God, and the treatment of sheep with stubborn, set-in-their-ways French sheep wranglers until he finally lands his big break herding in the idyllic Alps. While struggling to get a work visa, he meets a hot and charming bureaucrat who, even as she’s denying his paperwork, finds herself won over by his reckless sincerity. Shepherds is messy, earnest, and very, very French. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) BREE McKENNA Slanted USA, 2025 (104 min), Dir. Amy Wang Imagine if The Substance was about teenagers instead of adult celebrities, and instead of wanting to defy aging, it was about changing race. Slanted, the newest project from Amy Wang, centers on Joan Huang (Shirley Chang) and her pursuit of absolute assimilation: becoming prom queen. To fit in, Huang goes under the knife to change herself from Asian to white. Slanted mixes surrealism, slapstick comedy, and body horror. The people seem to love it—it won the Narrative Jury Award at SXSW— though they do say the middle drags a bit. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) NATHALIE GRAHAM Sons Denmark, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Gustav Möller Sons is the feel-bad film of the fest that, for all its bleak reflections about violence, punishment, and humanity, ends up saying surprisingly little. This is a shame, as writer-director Gustav Möller’s previous film, The Guilty (SIFF 2018), was a well-crafted work of genuine dread. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, May 25) CHASE HUTCHINSON Sorry, Baby USA, 2025 (101 min), Dir. Eva Victor After her world is shattered by her advisor sexually assaulting her, grad student Agnes (writer and first-time director Eva Victor) attempts to regain control of her life while living in the same sleepy New England college town and taking a professor job at her school. Victor deftly navigates a minefield of a topic with humor, grace, and quiet but powerful authenticity, resisting clichés about survivors in favor of demonstrating the unexpected healing properties of stray kittens, kind strangers, and a really good sandwich. The heart of the film is Agnes’s unconditional relationship with her ride-or-die lesbian best friend Lydie (Naomi Ackie), who supports her throughout her recovery despite moving away and doesn’t hesitate to consider helping Agnes commit arson. Bottom line: An astonishing debut and an irrefutable case for more movies made by women about their experiences. Please see this film.

His name is Souleymane, and in two days, he must, during his application for asylum, convince French authorities that he was beaten and imprisoned in Guinea for his political views. The problem? He is not political at all. He came to Paris to work. And the work he does is at the bottom of the city’s gig economy: He delivers food orders on an electric bike. The biker can’t afford to be late or to get an order wrong because that would result in a bad review, and a bad review would result in the app shutting him out of the network and out of much-needed work. To make matters worse, he has to share half of his meager earnings with Emmanuel, whose face is used to open and operate the app (as Souleymane can’t legally work in France). The Paris we see during the dash from one order to the next is far from the one that draws millions of tourists.

As of this writing, Katy Perry and co. just completed their bizarre 11-minute space trip bankrolled by the losers that are actively ending the planet we live on, so I got a kick out of hearing from Gentry Lee. Lee is a jet propulsion scientist, robotics engineer, and sci-fi author who has worked at NASA since the early ’70s and LOVES what he does. Lee yell-talks directly at the camera about his work on missions like Viking, marveling at how big of a deal it was to actually make it to Mars, and what it felt like to be in the room “solving problems that no one had ever had before” (we’re talking prodigies doing STEM with a fraction of the assistance of today). Starman isn’t saying anything new, but if you can get on Lee’s level, it is kind of mind-blowing to hear it told from a real one. Come for the gold Voyager record, stay for the footage of Carl Sagan slaying a turtleneck.

Robinson Devor “There comes a point where the only way to make a statement is to pick up a gun,” says Sara Jane Moore, the woman who attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford in San Francisco in 1975. Suburban Fury is directed by Robinson Devor, the same guy who brought us Zoo, with a little help from The Stranger’s own Charles Mudede. Devor gains historic access to Moore, who sheds light in an unpolished, often unreliable interview on how she went from a conservative suburban housewife to an FBI informant on radical political groups to an almost assassin. Suburban Fury tells Moore’s story at the same time it paints a picture of a decade of radical politics, braiding in footage of the Black Panthers, the Gay Liberation movement, the Attica Prison Rebellion, the United Farm Workers movement, and Patty Hearst’s kidnapping. Moore becomes convinced that killing Ford will expose the machinations of a government not for the people and inspire a revolution. While it centers on the 1970s, the political moment it captures doesn’t feel far off in 2025. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 21, May 23) NATHALIE GRAHAM Sudden Outbursts of Emotions Finland, 2024 (97 min), Dir. Paula Korva Sudden Outbursts of Emotions gets increasingly superficial the longer it carries on. It tells the story of a woman who, when not working at a travel agency, is burdened with soothing the fragile ego of her insecure boyfriend as his acting career seems to have stalled. She begins to question her life and relationship, just as said boyfriend suggests they open their relationship and attend a sex party where she meets someone new who will soon upend all she thought she knew about herself. At least, that’s what it feels like it ought to be, in theory. But the execution is far too narrow, and it’s oddly afraid to lay bare the body or the soul. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ Summer’s Camera South Korea, 2025 (82 min), Dir. Divine Sung A young girl discovers a secret after developing film on her deceased father’s camera. She also realizes that she is a lesbian after taking photographs of her school’s popular soccer star. Either of those plots may sound like they contain drama, but the pacing is peaceful; at all the moments you might expect turmoil, there is instead a surprisingly frictionless story. It’s subtle. Maybe too subtle. But it’s very beautifully shot, tender in its understatement, and culminates in a truly moving final scene. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21–22; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Tales From the Magic Garden Czech Republic, 2025 (71 min), Dir.. David Súkup, Patrik Pašš, Leon Vidmar, and Jean-Claude Rozec LA stop-motion, ethereally animated movie about children trying to fill the void they feel after losing their grandmother, their family’s storyteller. Critics ponder who is the audience for this movie because it is definitely a children’s movie, but the subject matter is, well, kinda morbid. They also say it’s slow. However, a reviewer at Loud and Clear said it’s “a gorgeous stop-motion animated tale that’s both an ode to the resilience of children and a reminder that we’re never not going to need to feel safe and looked after.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM The Things You Kill Canada, 2025 (113 min), Dir. Alireza Khatami You don’t have to read interviews with writer and director Alireza Khatami to know that he’s a fan of David Lynch: It’s all over his work. It’s in the way he calmly bends reality; the way he turns a nameless Turkish city into a character in the film; and the way he kills his central characters. Most people have described The Things You Kill as a thriller, but I don’t think it has quite enough tension to earn that title. It does have relentless foreshadowing: a pistol tucked in a water tank, mirror images that become reality, the haunting phrase “kill the light” leaking from a nightmare. But the narrative itself is quiet and methodical. The unraveling of one man as he faces his own impotence, an ailing mother, an abusive father, and an impossible moral dilemma. (AMC Pacific Place May 23–24) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ Time Travel Is Dangerous United Kingdom, 2024 (99 min), Dir. Chris Reading British besties Megan and Ruth run a vintage shop called Cha Cha Cha. They find a time machine in the alley and off they go, recklessly nicking items from any era they please to stock their shelves (and sometimes just to get takeaway from a closed restaurant). A group of inventors get involved because the machine is damaging the universe, of course. Listen, this film is deeply goofy. Almost every line of dialogue is a joke. I would not call the budget “big.” But the humor is British, which goes a long way—it’s styled as a mockumentary but is doing the tropes well enough that you’re legit enjoying the references? I was skeptical, I was, but then for whatever reason the more ridiculous shit they added, the more I thought, “yeah okay, swing big, why not.” The retro vibe is fun, and the characters are likeable. Just eat an edible, love. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23–24, streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Tinā New Zealand, 2024 (103 min), Dir. Miki Magasiva Tinā (which means “mother” in Samoan) is part Sister Act 2 (with rich kids, though), part Samoan grief opera, and part slow-burn school drama set in post-earthquake Christchurch. After losing her daughter in the 2011 quake, Mareta—a grief-stricken but quietly formidable teacher—takes a job at a posh Catholic school where the students are privileged, the staff are casually racist, and the choir doesn’t yet exist. She builds one from scratch, connecting with emotionally closed-off kids while working through her own loss. There’s class tension, personal tragedy, and who doesn’t love when all roads in the high school movie lead to a high-stakes music competition? The pacing is slow, but the film is carried by Mareta’s low-key intensity and culminates in a genuinely very moving final performance. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19) BREE McKENNA To a Land Unknown Greece, 2024 (106 min), Dir. Mahdi Fleifel This one looks dope, in a tense, traumatic way. To a Land Unknown is the story of Chatila, a Palestinian refugee living in Athens, and barely making ends meet. He’s caught in between existences—longing to get out of Athens and escape to journey while hovering on the periphery of Athens’ seedy underbelly. Chatila meets and connects with a variety of other refugees, people whom the audience may start to care for, only to eventually discard them for his own ends. As The Guardian writes, “[Director Mahdi Fleifel] allows us to invest in characters who are to disappear from the story, so we too can experience the emotional wasteland in which Chatila lives.” (AMC Pacific Place May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24) NATHALIE GRAHAM ★ To Kill a Mongolian Horse Malaysia, 2024 (97 min), Dir. Xiaoxuan Jiang In the past few years, the contemporary Western has emerged as a genre whose best films are often directed by women, a welcome shift from the traditional Western’s realm of heteronormative and patriarchal values. Chloé Zhao’s The Rider and Jane Campion’s The Power Of The Dog come to mind, and with To Kill A Mongolian Horse, Xiaoxuan Jiang joins this pantheon in her directorial debut. Her film sets itself apart, though, by being set in her native Inner Mongolia (an autonomous region within China) rather than the American West. It’s a fascinating look at a man who is stuck between wanting to honor his culture’s traditions in a countryside that is rapidly changing, and trying to make a living in the modern city, a place he feels he doesn’t really belong. With modernity itself emerging as the metaphysical foe of the cowboy of the 21st century, the contemporary Western has become a much more complex genre than its traditional counterpart. (AMC Pacific Place May 18, May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) MICHAEL McKINNEY Transfers Argentina, 2024 (90 min), Dir. Nicolás Gil Lavedra Transfers does not recount the full history of Argentina’s Dirty War period of 1976–83. Instead, this documentary focuses on one central and terrifying aspect of that military dictatorship’s reign: a biweekly series of “death flights” that dumped thousands of political prisoners to their brutal ends. By largely removing political pretext from the story—only brief mentions of socialism or communism—Transfers hammers home the utter depravity of the Argentinian regime for its actions, and also easily draws out metaphors for, er, certain modern regimes. Argentina’s administration freely destroyed internal records, lied to the media, and targeted mild offenses with brutality... but also enjoyed decades of relative impunity until persistent efforts turned up results. Those efforts are bravely recounted by remaining, living advocates in a crucial documentary that’s admittedly tough to watch, especially when victims’ mothers flood city streets to protest, only to become targets themselves. (SIFF Film Center May 18, May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Twinless USA, 2025 (100 min) , Dir. James Sweeney Fellas, is it gay to bond with a man over your shared grief after losing your twin while also pondering your place in a disconnected modern world? James Sweeney, the brilliant writer, director, and co-star of Twinless, says probably yes (complimentary), and so much more with this terrific dramedy that we can’t tell you almost anything about so as not to spoil the dark fun. What can be said is that Twinless sees Sweeney and Dylan O’Brien playing two troubled Portland guys who meet at an emotional support group for those who’ve lost an identical sibling. However, nothing is what it seems, and the film becomes the funniest, most chaotic, and ultimately most emotionally impactful movie to ever include key scenes surrounding attending Seattle Kraken games. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ U Are the Universe Ukraine, 2024 (101 min), Dir. Pavlo Ostrikov U Are the Universe is an indie drama about a man left adrift in space after the world as we know it is destroyed, who forms a connection with what may be the last other survivor. It’s creatively constructed and carves out its own distinct place in the well-worn genre, with the set design and visual effects proving remarkable, even before you learn that Ukrainian filmmaker Pavlo Ostrikov made it during the ongoing Russian invasion. It’s a love story of sorts with plenty of mirth, but also a mournful meditation, ripping the air from your lungs when it counts. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22, May 25) CHASE HUTCHINSON Unclickable Greece, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Babis Makridis Ad fraud, in which fraudsters show fake people fake websites that attract real ads for profit, may account for every third dollar spent on digital advertising, and it’s a hair-on-fire problem that director Babis Makridis lays squarely at the feet of Google and Facebook. The movie is convincing: I buy that ad fraud is a huge problem, likely killing local newspapers, funding misinformation, and plain ripping people off. For those reasons alone, governments should force big tech to deal with it. I also buy Makridis’s moral revulsion. But for a movie about what’s supposedly one of the biggest criminal schemes of our age, it’s boring, and the soundtrack (mostly fingers rocking back and forth between two notes on a Casio keyboard) nearly drove me insane. (SIFF Film Center May 19, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL Under the Volcano Poland, 2024 (102 min), Dir. Damian Kocur In Under the Volcano, a Ukrainian family’s chill beach trip to the Canary Islands turns existential overnight, as Russia launches its full-scale assault on Kyiv. While sunscreened Brits chug sangria nearby, Anastasiia, Roman, Sofiia, and Fedir spiral into panic, anxiety, and guilt while stranded in a paradise turned hellscape. Director Damian Kocur and co-writer Marta Konarzewska dial up the tension beautifully, letting family resentments bubble under the picture-perfect surface while in the shadow of a literal sleeping volcano. Through Gen Z daughter Sofiia’s eyes, we watch the strange numbness of survival unfold in real time. Grim, visually gorgeous, and timely as ever, Under the Volcano will hit you in your gut. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) MICHAEL McKINNEY Undercover Spain, 2024 (118 min), Dir. Arantxa Echevarría Spanish thriller based on a true story! The late 1990s! A young female police officer in San Sebastian infiltrates the Basque terrorist group, ETA! Lead actress Carolina Yuste (known for Sky High—but not the Sky High Disney movie about a high school for superheroes) stuns, according to reviewers. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, May 20) NATHALIE GRAHAM Viktor Denmark, 2024 (89 min), Dir. Olivier Sarbil Viktor is a samurai-obsessed, deaf, Ukrainian photojournalist who wishes he were a soldier. Director Olivier Sarbil really, really wants you to know all that, but Viktor is at its best when Sarbil gets out of the way. Throughout (especially in the too-perfect ending) Sarbil and Viktor are telling us two separate stories, and I prefer Viktor’s. His sullenness clashes with the swelling music and close-ups of bombing victims’ hands in plastic bags. It’s refreshing—they may air raid you every night, but they’ll never take your freedom to be a little bitchy when you get a haircut you don’t like. If you want a straight documentary about this war, watch 20 Days in Mariupol. If you’re more of a vibes guy and it won’t piss you off to watch a film about a photographer who never once gives us a clear view of his photographs, Viktor’s worth your time. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, May 19; streaming May 26–June 1) BRIGID KENNEDY The Village Next to Paradise Somalia, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Mo Harawe A breakout from the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, The Village Next to Paradise delivers a “sensitive and empathetic” view of Somalia, “an underappreciated and often vilified nation.” The film centers on a family struggling to not only survive, but thrive in a village where drone strikes fill the sky and living until tomorrow never feels like a sure thing. (SIFF Film Center May 19, May 21) NATHALIE GRAHAM The Wailing Spain, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Pedro Martín-Calero Don’t confuse this with the Korean flick by the same name. This Wailing is a precise, stylized, femme-centered horror film. Martín-Calero—previously best known for directing a music video for the Weeknd—breaks the narrative into three distinct stories:, each led by a different young woman that’s stalked by (or stalking) something inescapable. (Shoreline Community College May 17, AMC Pacific Place May 25) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER Waves Czech Republic, 2024 (131 min), Dir. Jiří Mádl While watching Waves, which is set in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia, I got lost in its marvelous lighting and wardrobe. I could not get enough of both, scene after scene. True, the film’s story is relevant (journalists facing censorship or worse, dictators oppressing freedoms, and the like), but, ultimately, it didn’t say much more than this: “democracy dies in silence” (and, in this film, radio silence). (Shoreline Community College May 21, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE ★ Wolf Land USA, 2025 (71 min), Dir. Sarah Hoffman We should get this out of the way: Wolf Land is basically a dating profile for its featured player. Sure, the documentary thoughtfully explores the tension between wildlife advocates and ranchers, but then Daniel Curry’s mop of curly hair rides into the prairie, and, well, GOOSH. Tall, handsome, kind to animals, drops dad jokes, advocates intelligently for animal cohabitation, bridges political divides, and lives with his many pets (including three cutie-pie Dobermanns, who appear in a framed photo in his Eastern Washington cabin labeled “The Lads,” ARE YOU KIDDING ME). In good news, there’s more here, particularly how Curry and a rancher eke out a sweet, surprising friendship. (Shoreline Community College May 17, AMC Pacific Place May 18) SAM MACHKOVECH

Title: Gex Trilogy gets a release date and a physical edition featuring a 36-inch inflatable

Full Content:
On Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June. The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it is promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould. The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and Steam on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a $39.99 USD Standard Edition, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a $74.99 Classic Edition that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game. If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a $199.99 Tail Time Edition, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please. Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which announced layoffs earlier this year - is assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot, and continuing work on an untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped.

Title: Slog AM: Cops Who Killed Tyre Nichols Walk Free, Gates Foundation Plans to Close, Ferguson Signs Rent Cap

Time Published: 2025-05-08T16:34:00Z
Full Content:
Weather: Today will be mostly sunny with a high of 63 degrees. Enjoy it while it lasts, because the rain’s just backstage, doing vocal warm-ups for its big return in the next few days. Gates Foundation Calls It Quits: Mark your calendars for December 31, 2045. That’s when the Gates Foundation will be shutting its doors for good. Since 2000, they’ve thrown over $100 billion at public health and claimed to have cut worldwide childhood deaths in half, because nothing says progress like fixing problems with the same obscene wealth that helped create them. Bill Gates, in full humblebrag mode, told the New York Times, “We went from 10 million childhood deaths to five million,” and insists they’ll keep shrinking that number because apparently, “the Golden Rule was not repealed.” In the next 20 years, he plans to spend down the entire endowment of the foundation, and much of his personal wealth, he told the Times. Nothing says do unto others like hoarding enough cash to play God for a couple more decades before peacing out. Ferguson Signs Rent Cap: Well, lookie there, Governor Bob Ferguson can do something remotely progressive. Yesterday he signed a law capping rent hikes at 10% a year for most tenants, making Washington the third state to put rent stabilization on the books after Oregon and California. So now, landlords can only jack up rents by 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. New buildings (12 years old and younger) and certain owner-occupied properties are exempt. Most folks are celebrating because, hello, no more outrageous rent hikes, but others, like the landlord advocacy group Rental Housing Association, are freaking out, claiming it’ll kill the housing market. Right… Bottom line: it’s a win for renters, but we’re just scratching the surface of the housing crisis. Judge Says No to Libya Deportations: The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport migrants to Libya—yes, Libya, the place that happens to have a Level 4 travel advisory for crime, terrorism, and armed conflict—using US military planes to ship people off like Amazon Prime for human suffering. Fortunately, a federal judge quickly reminded Terror 47 that shipping human beings off to a war zone without notice or a chance to contest it blatantly violates his order, but hey, when has the law ever slowed down the empire? Judge Brian Murphy, who had already blocked the administration from deporting people to countries other than their own, made it clear: “The Court sees none,” when it comes to any doubt that these deportations would break the law. Meanwhile, Libya itself is saying, “We never agreed to this,” but since when has consent ever mattered to Trump? Cops Who Killed Tyre Nichols Walk Free: Three former Memphis cops—Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith—just walked free on all state charges, including second-degree murder, for the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols. Now, let’s get this straight: they were convicted of witness tampering in federal court but somehow (mostly) skated on civil rights violations—because apparently, beating a man to death just isn’t quite enough evidence. Civil rights lawyers called it, “a devastating miscarriage of justice,” which is the polite way of saying, “What in the actual fuck?” Meanwhile, the DOJ found out Memphis cops have basically been running their own Fight Club with a badge—so maybe, just maybe, it’s time we stop acting shocked when the system does exactly what it was designed to do. We Got A New Pope: It’s official. This morning, white smoke billowed from the Vatican chimney, meaning we officially have a new pope. Behind locked doors, a conclave of 133 cardinals decided which one of them is holiest, like a cosmic game of Catholic bingo. Any minute now, he'll step onto that balcony, wave to the masses, and remind us that God is watching...but apparently only through their eyes. Stagflation Nation: The Fed just rang the stagflation alarm as the U.S. economy sags under Trump. Inflation’s creeping up, jobs are shaky, and the culprit—surprise!—is “volatile trade activity,” a.k.a. Trump’s tariff chaos. In a flailing attempt at distraction, Trump is hyping a sad little trade deal with the UK, while U.S. trade officials lean on countries battered by those same tariffs to make room for Starlink internet service, sold by Nazi-loving absent-daddy Elon Musk. DOGE Wants Your Data: In more Musk news, what could go wrong with a massive, centralized government database run by the Nazi-saluter? According to the Washington Post, Musk’s little doges are quietly hoarding personal information on Americans. Civil rights advocates and some federal employeees are are warning this isn't just hacker bait — it’s a handy little tool for targeting political enemies or screwing with access to public services. Columbia University Crackdown: On Tuesday night, more than 100 students at Columbia University occupied Butler Library, renaming it the Basel Al-Araj Popular University in honor of the slain Palestinian intellectual. Their demand: that Columbia divest from Israeli apartheid and genocide. The response: riot cops and repression. According to NBC News, NYPD and Columbia security trapped protesters inside the building and refused to let them leave unless they handed over their IDs. Protesters reportedly laughed at the demand. At least 78 people were detained. “We refuse to go down quietly,” said the students in a post-raid statement. UW Suspends 21 Students: The Columbia crackdown comes just as the University of Washington suspended 21 students accused of occupying a new engineering building in protest of the school’s partnership with Boeing, a company whose weapons have been used in Israel’s assault on Gaza. Police arrested at least 31 people during that occupation, with the university claiming "significant damage" to equipment—though no full estimate has been released. Some students are now banned from all UW campuses. Student group SUPER UW said in the social media statement that many students sustained injuries from the SPD, “some to the extent of hospitalization.” Adios High-Capacity Magazines: The Washington State Supreme Court just upheld the state’s ban on high-capacity magazines, shrugging off a lower court’s gripe that it was unconstitutional. In a 7-2 decision, the justices declared that magazines packing more than 10 rounds aren’t “arms” protected by state or federal constitutions, meaning the 2022 law stands—no buying or selling these ammo hogs in Washington, though you can still hang on to the ones you’ve got. Justice Charles Johnson wrote that high-capacity mags aren’t crucial for self-defense and Gov. Ferguson pointed out their outsized role in mass shootings and insisted that sensible gun laws don’t trample your right to pack heat. Maybe if you need 30 rounds to feel safe, the problem isn’t the magazine—it’s you. Medicaid Cuts Threaten Care Facilities: Trump’s cutting Medicaid, and guess what? Long-term care facilities in Washington, like Edmonds Care, might close, leaving millions of elderly and disabled folks out in the cold. A simple 5% cut would force massive layoffs and could shut down 65% of these places—people would have nowhere to go. And with the number of seniors needing care on the rise, this isn’t just bad, it’s a crisis. If you care about your fellow humans, maybe pick up the phone and tell your reps to stop treating human lives like they’re the damn Squid Game. From Real Housewives to Holocaust Memorial: So, Trump decided to swap out Biden’s picks for the Holocaust Memorial Council with his usual lineup of sycophants, including—wait for it—Real Housewives of New Jersey star Siggy Flicker. Yes, you heard that right. The same Siggy whose stepson was arrested for storming the Capitol on January 6th is now in charge of overseeing a museum dedicated to one of the darkest periods in human history. If you watched her on TV, you know she probably believes “Never Forget” is a trending hashtag, not a solemn mission. Behold, LimeGliders: Seattle is now the first city to roll out LimeGliders—scooters that look like bikes, because why not make transportation even more confusing? Lime’s betting big on the Emerald City to test out their latest and greatest, using our city’s hills, rain, and general weather chaos as the ultimate proving ground. So now you’ve got 3,000 of these LimeGliders on the streets, alongside e-bikes and stand-up scooters, all while we’re trying to stay at the top of the micromobility game. Just don’t forget your helmet, because when you inevitably eat it, at least you’ll have some protection while questioning your life choices! Next Step in Council Ethics Changes: Later today, the City Council’s Governance, Accountability & Economic Development Committee will be deliberating on whether to ditch the whole “recuse yourself if you’ve got skin in the game” rule. You know, that pesky ethics thing that says if you might make a few bucks off a vote, maybe don’t vote on it? Instead, they want council members to just disclose their conflicts and keep right on voting. It basically amounts to, “Yeah, I might get rich off this, but at least I told you first!” If you’re downtown today at 2 PM, maybe swing by City Hall, grab the mic during public comment, and remind them that ethics aren’t just vibes—they’re rules for a reason. Should the proposal pass out of committee, it could head to a full council vote as early as May 20. Yes, as I mentioned to kick off Slog AM, the sun is shining today, so it might feel a little odd to suggest a morning sing-along to "Can You Stand the Rain." But damn it, it’s R&B singer Desmon Dennis’ birthday, so shout out to him and his soulful cover of New Edition’s ultimate slow jam.

Title: Here’s why Trump killing the ‘AI diffusion rule’ is a win for chipmakers
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-amd-trump-biden-ai-chips-china-rule-1851779738
Time Published: 2025-05-08T16:25:00Z
Full Content:
The U.S. government plans to withdraw a rule introduced under the Biden administration that had aimed to restrict exports of advanced AI chips — a policy that had posed challenges for major semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) and AMD (AMD+0.47%). “The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic and would stymie American innovation,” a spokeswoman from the Commerce Department said in a statement. The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios. The regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China. Chipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland. The shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively. But any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market. Nvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions. Last month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. The stock and cryptocurrency market comeback from the tariff crash was in full swing Thursday, as President Donald Trump expanded investors’ risk appetite. Stocks have recovered all of their "Liberation Day" losses and then some. You better go out and buy stock now,” Trump said Thursday from the Oval Office. That direct encouragement accelerated an equity market rally which began as the president showed further inclination to back off of his most aggressive trade war plans and brandished a new trade deal with the U.K., the first such agreement of his second term. All three primary barometers of the U.S. stock market surged to multi week highs, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest level since April 2, the S&P 500 notched its top price since March 27 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq touched its highest level since March 26. The Dow rose 570 points, or 1.4%, by early afternoon, while the S&P climbed 1.4% and the Nasdaq popped 1.8%. Trump’s encouragement to buy stocks mirrored his messaging ahead of the 90-day pause he placed last month on the most aggressive of his country-by-country tariffs. Digital assets rode optimism of trade war deescalation to solid gains, as the three most valuable tokens – bitcoin, ether and XRP – each rose at least 3.9% in the 24-hour period ending midday Thursday. Bitcoin, by far the most valuable crypto asset, topped $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 4 during the rally. All but one of the S&P’s 13 sectors gained Thursday, but it was the “magnificent seven” grouping of big tech companies championing the rally. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla were all up at least 0.8%, led by Tesla’s 4% gain, as the growth-focused septet enjoyed Wall Street’s move to risk. Bloomberg’s index tracking the seven stock rose 2%. The S&P tallied its longest winning streak in 21 years from April 22 through last Friday, erasing what was a 12% loss from April 2 through April 8 as Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs wreaked havoc. The benchmark is still down 7% from its February peak. The bounce comes even as Trump engages in a stare down with the U.S.’ top monetary policy official, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed declined to lower interest rates this week as it waits to see further evidence of how Trump’s tariffs will work their way through the economy, much to Trump’s dismay. Trump called Powell a “fool” and Thursday likened speaking with the central banker like “talking to a wall.”

Title: UK trade deal announcement brings hope to Wall Street

Stan Choe, Associated Press Stan Choe, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising Thursday after President Donald Trump said he was set to announce an agreement on trade with the United Kingdom, the first of what Wall Street hopes will be enough to keep a recession from hitting the economy. The S&P 500 was 0.6 percent higher in morning trading and on track for an 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 260 points, or 0.6 percent, as of 10:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8 percent higher. Stocks have been swinging for weeks with hopes that Trump could reach deals with other countries that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked. Trump said Thursday that the U.K. agreement is “a full and comprehensive one.” WATCH: Trump announces trade deal with UK, cutting tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum “Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!” he added on his Truth Social account. It could be an encouraging start, and analysts said they’re curious to see if it will affect the 10 percent tariffs that Trump placed on all imports coming into the United States on “Liberation Day.” But bigger trading partners could offer bigger hurdles, including China. The world’s second-largest economy again on Thursday called on the United States to cancel its tariffs, ahead of high-level talks between the world’s two largest economies that could take place this weekend. That followed Trump saying on Wednesday that he wouldn’t reduce his 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as a condition for negotiations. Besides hopes for deals on trade, strong profit reports from U.S. companies have also helped to drive the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high set in February. Axon Enterprise, the company that sells Tasers, body cameras and other public safety equipment, jumped 12.5 percent after joining the list. It benefited from strong growth for its software and services, and it raised its forecast for revenue over the full year. Tapestry rose 2.7 percent after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade brands also reported better profit and revenue than expected. It credited new, younger customers in North America, among other things. Molson Coors, though, described a different landscape when it released its latest quarterly results, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Its stock fell 4.9 percent. “The global macroeconomic environment is volatile,” CEO Gavin Hattersley said. “Uncertainty around the effects of geopolitical events and global trade policy, including the impacts on economic growth, consumer confidence and expectations around inflation, and currencies has pressured the beer industry and consumption trends.” It became the latest company to either lower or pull its financial forecasts for 2025 given the uncertainty. Krispy Kreme tumbled 19.5 percent after withdrawing its forecasts for the full year. The doughnut seller said it made the move in part because of “macroeconomic softness” and because it’s pausing the rollout of sales of its doughnuts at more McDonald’s restaurants. The U.S. economy has remained OK so far, with the Federal Reserve saying Wednesday that it still looks to be running at a solid rate underneath the surface. But pessimism has soured sharply among U.S. households because of tariffs, and the fear is that all the uncertainty created by them could be enough to force the economy into a recession. A couple mixed reports on the economy Thursday did little to clear the caution. One said slightly fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. But another one said productivity for U.S. workers slowed by more than economists expected during the first three months of the year. That could keep upward pressure on inflation, when tariffs could be set to raise prices for all kinds of imported products. Treasury yields rose following the reports, and the 10-year yield climbed to 4.32 percent from 4.26 percent late Wednesday. In stock markets abroad, the FTSE 100 slipped 0.3 percent in London after the Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Indexes were modestly higher across much of the rest of Europe and Asia. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: I shopped at Ollie's Bargain Outlet for the first time and found lower prices than at Target and Walmart
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ollies-bargain-outlet-prices-shopping-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-08T14:32:05Z

When I mentioned that I planned to visit Ollie's Bargain Outlet for an article, several of my East Coast-based colleagues responded with some variation of "OMG I LOVE OLLIE'S." I'd never heard of Ollie's until the brand acquired 40 former Big Lots stores across the US in February, including four new locations in my home state of Wisconsin, but it appears to have cultivated a loyal following of bargain-hunters. Another indicator of the brand's staying power: as many brick-and-mortar stores downsize and struggle to stay afloat, Ollie's is one of the fastest-growing brands in the US in 2025, according to a Yelp report. Net sales grew 8% in the 2024 fiscal year to $2.27 billion, according to Ollie's latest earnings report. It also opened 50 new stores in the 2024 fiscal year, bringing its total to 559 stores in 31 states, and it plans to open 75 more locations by February 2026. President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs may also increase the popularity of discounted shopping locations, as consumers are expected to pay more for items such as groceries, electronics, and toys once they're implemented. I visited Ollie's to compare its prices to Target and Walmart and see if it lived up to its slogan of "Good stuff cheap." Take a look inside. All four new Ollie's locations in Wisconsin opened in February. There are no longer any Big Lots stores in Wisconsin after the brand closed 200 stores across 41 states in 2024. The carts appeared to contain mostly seasonal items such as summer-themed tumblers and beach towels for $2.99. It reminded me of the Bullseye's Playground section at Target containing items costing between $1 and $5. Ollie's, founded by Mark Butler, Mort Bernstein, Harry Coverman, and its namesake, Oliver "Ollie" Rosenberg, opened its first store in Pennsylvania in 1982. Its 100th store opened in 2011, and Ollie's became a publicly traded company in 2015. The walls at Ollie's were plastered with illustrated signs advertising the low prices in creative ways, such as "Caution: bargains ahead" with "Ollie" dressed as a construction worker, and "Knockout deals" showing the character wearing boxing gloves. Everywhere I turned, I saw another quirky sign that made me chuckle. Instead of selling the new releases and bestsellers I usually see at big-box chains, Ollie's stocked an eclectic collection of graphic novels, coffee table books, volumes of Bible studies, and picture books for kids. I thought the coffee table books in particular would make great inexpensive gifts. I found a giant book about baseball stadiums for $7.99 that the baseball enthusiasts in my life would love. In one of the grocery aisles filled with canned goods and condiments, many of the items were still in boxes. I recognized some brands, like Campbell's and Libby's, but others were new to me. Piles of boxes crowding a store can indicate understaffing and may deter customers from shopping if they have to squeeze through the aisles, Business Insider previously reported. Since most of the merchandise was shelved in cardboard boxes, this could have been more of a stylistic choice. I compared prices using the Target and Walmart apps on my phone while browsing the aisles at Ollie's. The same 8.9-ounce box of Cheerios costs $4.49 at Target and $3.68 at Walmart. A can costs $2.69 at Target. At Walmart, it was on sale for $2.48, which was still more expensive than Ollie's. That three-pack would cost $5.79 at Target and was listed for $12.80 on Walmart's website, though it's likely cheaper in-store. Ollie's keeps its prices low by buying closeout, irregular, discontinued, and overstock merchandise at a discount. The limited edition Dove body washes, which retailed for $4.99 at Ollie's, were no longer available at Target or Walmart. Other Dove body washes of the same size sell for $8.69 at Target and $7.97 at Walmart. A Black and Decker Crisp 'N Bake air fryer and toaster oven was priced at $39.99 at Ollie's, while a regular four-slice toaster oven cost $29.99. Target appeared to sell the same four-slice toaster oven for $29.99, matching Ollie's price, but it was difficult to compare prices for the air fryer since I didn't find exact matches on their websites. Perhaps the toaster-air fryer combination Ollie's had in stock was an older or discontinued model that is no longer sold in other locations. There were also new air conditioners for sale, like a 10,000 BTU window unit from Danby priced at $279.99. The exact design I saw no longer appears to be sold by Danby, though the company offers other units with the same cooling power for $429.99 and above. The raw flooring materials in the housewares section reminded me of Menard's, a Midwestern home-improvement chain frequented by contractors and DIYers and known for its mail-in rebate discounts. Laminate chestnut oak flooring cost 97 cents per square foot, while 5-foot by 7-foot Zephyr Collection rugs cost $99.99. Barbies ranged from $8.99 to $12.99 at Ollie's, which was less expensive than at other stores. For example, the "You Can Be Anything" teacher Barbie cost $8.99 at Ollie's compared to $14.99 at Target and $11.60 at Walmart. Toy prices are expected to increase due to Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Ollie's is a store with personality. The vibrant comic book-like signage and the treasure-hunting nature of sorting through the aisles made for an enjoyable outing. The prices were also lower than big-box competitors like Walmart and Target. I wouldn't necessarily shop at Ollie's if I needed a specific brand of cereal or shampoo since the inventory varies based on what discounted merchandise is available, but if I just need some "Good stuff cheap" once Trump's tariffs take effect, I'd definitely shop there again. When BI reached out to Walmart and Target about how their prices compare to Ollie's, a Walmart representative told BI: "At Walmart, we operate an every day low price model, in which we work to remove costs through efficiencies in our own operations and supply chain — to operate at an every day low cost (EDLC) so that we can in turn provide our customers with every low prices (EDLP). We constantly advocate for lower prices on behalf of our customers." Representatives for Target and Ollie's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jump to

Title: Mark Zuckerberg announces mind-control

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Mark Zuckerberg has told investors how he plans to make back the tens of billions he's spending on AI: he's going to use it to make advertisements that can bypass our critical faculties and convince anyone to buy anything. In other words, Meta will make an AI mind-control ray and rent it out to grateful advertisers. Here, Zuck is fulfilling the fundamental duty of every CEO of every high-growth tech company: explaining how his company will continue to grow. These growth stories are key, because growth stocks trade at a huge premium relative to the stocks of "mature" companies. Every dollar Meta brings in boosts their share price to a much greater degree than the dollars earned by companies with similar rates of profit, but slower rates of growth. This premium represents a bet by investors that Meta will continue to grow, which means that the instant Meta stops growing, the value of its shares will plummet, to reflect the fact that it is a "mature" company, not a "growth" company. So Zuck needs to do everything he can to keep investors believing that Meta will continue to grow. After all, Zuck's key employees and top managers all take much (or even most!) of their compensation in Meta stock, which means that the instant the company stops growing, those workers' pay will plummet and they will seek employment elsewhere, depriving Meta of the workers it needs to successfully create or conquer a new market and once again become a growth stock. This is why Zuck keeps telling stories. The most important story Zuck tells is about himself, the boy genius who converted a tool for nonconsensually rating the fuckability of Harvard undergrads into a social media monopoly with four billion users. Zuck's cult of personality isn't the product of mere narcissism – it's a tool for creating the material conditions for ongoing investor confidence: https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-shirt-latin-what-does-it-say-explained-words-2024-9 If Zuck is a boy genius, then Zuck's pronouncements take on the character of prophesy. When Zuck announced the "pivot to video," investors poured tens of billions into Facebook stock and into video-first online news production, despite the fact that Zuck was obviously lying: https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html The "boy genius" story is an example of Silicon Valley's storied "reality distortion field," pioneered by Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Zuck is a Texas marksman, who fires a shotgun into the side of a barn and then draws a target around the holes. Jobs is remembered for his successes, and forgiven his (many, many) flops, and so is Zuck. The fact that pivot to video was well understood to have been a catastrophic scam didn't stop people from believing Zuck when he announced "metaverse." Zuck lost more than $70b on metaverse, but, being a boy genius Texas marksman, he is still able to inspire confidence from credulous investors. Zuck's AI initiatives generated huge interest in Meta's stock, with investors betting that Zuck would find ways to keep Meta's growth going, despite the fact that AI has the worst unit economics of any tech venture in living memory. AI is a business that gets more expensive as time goes on, and where the market's willingness to pay goes down over time. This makes the old dotcom economics of "losing money on every sale, but making it up in volume" look positively rosy: https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/ Now, Zuck has finally described how he's going to turn AI's terrible economics around: he's going to ask AI to design his advertisers' campaigns, and these will be so devastatingly effective that advertisers will pay a huge premium to advertise on Meta: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-revolution-is-an-advertising-revolution-morning-brief-100001467.html This narrative is especially galling because it's literally the same story Zuck has been telling for decades: "Facebook has built a mind-control ray out of Big Data, and we can sell anything to anyone": https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/30/dont-believe-the-criti-hype/#ordinary-mediocrities This is a facially absurd proposition. After all, everyone who's ever claimed to have perfected mind-control – Rasputin, Mesmer, MK-ULTRA, neurolinguistic programming grifters and pathetic "pick up artists" – was a liar. Either they were lying to themselves, or to everyone else. Or both. But many of tech's critics helped sell this narrative (and thus helped Meta sell ads). Many critics have fallen prey to the sin of "criti-hype," Lee Vinsel's term for critiquing the claims of your adversary without bothering to ask whether they are true: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/02/euthanize-rentiers/#dont-believe-the-hype The project of convincing investors that tech's "dopamine hackers" had perfected mind-control with warmed over, non-replicable Skinnerian behavior-mod techniques and mass surveillance sold a hell of a lot of ads. After all, if there's one kind of person the advertising sector has always been able to sell to, it's advertising executives, who are the easiest of marks for a story about how easy it is to trick the public into buying whatever you're selling: https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost Every ad-tech sales-bro who takes a meeting with an advertising executive finds himself pushing on an open door. Advertisers desperately wants to believe in mind-control rays. Think of the department store magnate John Wannamaker, who said, "half my advertising spending is wasted – I just don't know which half." Imagine: some advertising exec convinced John Wannamaker that he was only wasting half of his advertising spending! I've long maintained that the threat from AI to workers isn't that AI can do your job – it's that an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete The corollary here is that it doesn't matter if AI can design ads that work, not so long as an AI ad salesman can sell this proposition to advertisers, and not so long as a tech CEO can sell it to investors. AI keeps passing the worst kinds of Turing tests – for example, it's great at convincing people who are prone to life-destroying hallucinations that they are talking to God: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/ Zuck kept up his growth story with this mind control narrative for more than a decade, got caught committing a string of spectacular frauds, and then lured investors back into his stock offerings by telling the same story. This isn't just an indictment of Zuck, it's a stinging rebuke to the whole idea that markets are a kind of infallible computer for assessing and operationalizing information. The market's "thought process" demonstrably lacks the object permanence that most babies acquire by the time they are a year old. You can tell when your child has acquired object permanence by the fact that they cease to enjoy "peek-a-boo" (object permanence means they understand where you have gone when your face is hidden). In claiming that AI will give him an infinite growth mind-control ray, Mark Zuckerberg is challenging the market to a game of peek-a-boo – and he's winning.

Title: Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in a core business unit

More Google workers are leaving When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google has revealed yet another headcount reduction affecting around 200 workers in its global business unit (via Reuters). The workers come from a department responsible for sales and partnerships, with the redundancies part of a broader cost-cutting move with Google shifting its focus to data centers and AI – a true sign of the times. In a statement, Google said the changes would "drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve our customers." It is the latest in a series of announcements of job cuts at Google, after the company recently laid off several hundred workers across its Pixel and Android departments, with its HR department also affected earlier in February 2025. Still, that's not a patch on Google's widespread layoffs in January 2023, when 12,000 workers were sent home – about 6% of its global workforce. As of December 2024, Google had just over 183,000 workers, so while the reduction of 200 global business unit workers isn't significant in terms of percentage, it's still very much an unwelcome decision for all of those affected. Google isn't the only company making regular minor adjustments, either. Meta recently laid off around 100 employees in its reality labs unit, and a considerable 3,600 (5%) earlier in February when CEO Mark Zuckerberg told workers to prepare for an "intense year." Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Microsoft has made two minor adjustments this calendar year (via layoffs.fyi), while Amazon and Apple have also made some revisions.

Happy almost Friday! Some good news this morning: A cheap, widely-prescribed diabetes drug is showing some promise in preventing colon cancer. In today's big story, Google's stock tanked after an Apple exec said AI engines are starting to challenge the search engine's dominance. If you haven't subscribed to our new newsletter Tech Memo, what are you waiting for? What's on deck Markets: Trump teases first 'major trade deal' — and it's set to be with the UK. Tech: Big Tech is all about rewarding its stars and getting rid of everyone else. Business: People are fed up with companies' 'bait and switch pricing.' But first, can you Google ChatGPT this? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. AI giveth, and AI taketh. Google seems to be learning that the hard way, as the new tech is gaining ground on one of its crown jewels. Apple executive Eddy Cue said searches on its Safari browser shrank for the first time last month, and he's pointing the finger at AI engines, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Cue also said AI tools like OpenAI and Perplexity AI would eventually supplant traditional search engines, and Apple will offer them to Safari users in the future. Google investors took the news hard, with shares dropping more than 8% on Wednesday. Cue has a vested interest in Google's search business, since Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on the iPhone. Still, in theory, Apple might be able to replace some or all of that money with payments from the OpenAIs of the world. (Cue's comments came while testifying in the federal antitrust suit against Google's parent company, Alphabet. When it rains, it pours.) The AI boom obviously hasn't been all bad for Google. The interest in the tech gave it the green light to invest billions in new development. The results weren't always great, but it largely seems happy with the progress made on things like its AI Overviews. But as much as it tries to reshape itself, the progress made by its younger, smaller AI rivals is becoming undeniable. It's not just the new kids on the block enjoying the AI revolution. A very, very old player has newfound success leveraging AI. IBM is full speed ahead on its AI strategy, and Wall Street is eating it up, writes BI's Matthew Fox. The company's stock is up almost 15% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 5%. At its recent conference, CEO Arvind Krishna said its generative AI business is now worth $6 billion. IBM's focus is helping companies adopt AI, and has the added benefit of an open-source approach. That allows it to work with clients regardless of the AI tools they prefer, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Matthew. (If you're looking for more tech coverage like this, subscribe to our upcoming tech newsletter Tech Memo. Alistair Barr will be running the show, and he does a much better job of covering tech than me.) 1. Trump's first post-tariffs trade deal. The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with the UK on Thursday. A Downing Street spokeswoman told BI that talks between the two countries had been "continuing at pace" and the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, would provide an update later on Thursday. 2. No surprises from the Fed. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected, although Chairman Jerome Powell had faced calls from President Trump and members of his administration to lower them. Powell has stressed waiting to see how tariffs affect the economy. 3. Jefferies banker's death ruled an accident. Carter McIntosh, a 28-year-old associate, died of a toxic mix of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine, an autopsy revealed. His death in January sparked widespread backlash against the bank's work culture. 1. Big Tech has a new playbook. Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards, with top performers receiving larger payouts and low performers facing the heat. Meanwhile, new-hire offers are being reduced. 2. How a meme empire is sliding into your DMs. The Instagram gold rush isn't in the grid anymore — it's in your DMs. Doing Things, the company that owns meme accounts like Overheard, told BI its strategy to get users to share its content. 3. Meet Valarian, a new addition from the Palantir mafia. The Palantir-alumni-founded startup wants to help governments and companies control their data and has plans to expand into the defense sector. Its current seed round has raised $20 million. 1. Pro-Tesla, anti-Musk. Working for Tesla was Matthew LaBrot's dream job, but he was fired after publishing a website protesting Elon Musk. In an interview with BI, he shared his concern for how the billionaire is affecting Tesla's brand and sales — and why he still believes in the company anyway. 2. Recession fears got nothing on Disney adults. They know a Disney vacation is pricey, but they're going anyway. Disney World visits are surging, US parks revenue soared last quarter, and soon, they'll have a new magical destination to add to the list: Abu Dhabi. 3. Does $19.95 to rent a U-Haul truck sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Companies are using "bait-and-switch" tactics to lure customers in with one price, only to tack on extra fees and make the total nowhere near what was initially expected. It's so common that customers often throw their hands up and pay anyway. Paramount, News Corp, Coinbase, and Lyft report earnings.

Title: Markets climb as Trump teases UK trade breakthrough

U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, with major indexes climbing. Tech led the day’s rally, and the Nasdaq closed up slightly over 1%. The S&P 500 rose 0.58% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254 points, or 0.62%. The surge was brought on by President Trump’s announcement of a trade deal Thursday with the United Kingdom— his first since April’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs. In other White House news, Trump is also expected to roll back and replace Biden-era AI chip rules. Markets are absorbing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest remarks. The central bank announced Wednesday that it will hold interest rates steady, with Powell taking a wait-and-see stance. While the job market remains healthy and core inflation is easing, tariffs are introducing new economic uncertainty, Powell said. He made it clear the Fed is in no rush to shift course, emphasizing the need for more data — especially on how tariff-driven price pressures play out. Elsewhere, central banks abroad are cutting rates, but they’re not contending with the exact same inflationary wildcards. On Wednesday, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%) shares fell 7% on reports that Apple (AAPL-0.39%) may integrate AI tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity into Safari, threatening Google’s dominance as the browser’s default search engine. During federal antitrust testimony, Apple executive Eddy Cue said Safari search volume had declined for the first time — signaling that users are already shifting toward AI alternatives. With Google paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year for default status, the news rattled investors and sparked fresh concerns about Alphabet’s long-term search moat. Apple shares initially fell 2% on the same news, but both companies gained on Thursday, with Alphabet up 1.9% and Apple up 0.6%, too. AB InBev (BUD+0.91%) kicked off the earnings day with a solid report. The brewer posted nearly 8% EBITDA growth and stronger margins, even as volumes slipped 2.2% due to tough comps and weather. Mega-brands such as Corona — up 11% outside its home market — led the way, while no-alcohol and direct-to-consumer sales also notched meaningful gains. The company reiterated its 2025 outlook and emphasized ongoing investments in premium products and digital platforms. Shopify (SHOP-4.98%) reported before the bell today. Energy majors ConocoPhillips (COP-3.65%) and Cheniere Energy (LNG-3.98%) also announced earnings today, alongside Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ-2.47%) and Brookfield (BAM-1.97%), offering a look at global demand, margins, and infrastructure amid falling oil prices.

Title: Southern California’s Industrial Warehouse Market Plays an Anxious Waiting Game
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/05/california-ports-industrial-tariffs-port/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T10:00:05Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy In 2024, the bustling Port of Los Angeles processed 10.2 million shipping containers, the boat-born boxes that carry the goods of global trade. Measured via a stat called TEUs, the annual haul was the second-most in the port’s history and a 20 percent jump from the year before. This May, port watchers expect the harbor to be relatively quiet, as President Donald Trump’s tariffs — now 145 percent on Chinese goods — tank shipping volumes. The last cargo vessels from China that set sail before Trump began ramping up tariffs in early February have already docked, signaling the steep dropoff expected in trans-Pacific cargo. Port of L.A. Director Gene Seroka expects the number of ships to drop by 25 percent, with overall trade volume falling by a third. A report by Apollo Global Management suggests the levies will lead to empty store shelves, spur layoffs in the trucking and retail sector, and precipitate a recession in just a few months. The entire U.S. economy and supply chain has tried to adjust and brace for the impacts of the tariffs, and that includes Southern California’s industrial warehouses. The impacts on those will depend on factors such as tenant base and the duration of any higher tariffs. Few sectors remain as closely tied to the comings and goings of California’s ports than those warehouses. Roughly 13 percent of the GDP of the Greater L.A. region and $93.3 billion in tax revenue depends on shipping and logistics, according to a presentation by Stephen Cheung, president and CEO of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. More than 2,000 foreign-owned firms in this industry operate, and rent storage space, in and around the global commerce hub. Saying the region’s roughly 2 billion square feet of industrial real estate might be impacted is an understatement. Disrupting the trade on which warehouse construction and operation hinge could have a critical and long-term impact on the region’s economy. The day after the April 2 tariff announcements, warehouse giant Prologis’ share price dropped 9.6 percent. “This is like the Dodgers winning the World Series last year, and then just trading all their players and saying, ‘We’ll figure something out when the draft comes along,’” said former California Gov. Gray Davis on the logic of tariffs during the LAEDC call about the port slowdown. The owners and operators of industrial real estate in Southern California, while certainly anxious about the impact, haven’t hit the panic button yet, despite the prediction that port real estate will be particularly hard hit. Part of the reason is the diversity within the sector and SoCal itself. About 75 percent of logistics real estate demand in Southern California is tied to local and regional distribution, according to Prologis research. Authors of the Prologis report believe this “blend of uses — serving both import flows and end consumption — will help insulate the region’s logistics real estate from sharp swings in trade activity.” But, as tenants feel out tariff impacts and rework their real estate strategies, the entire sector — massive retail warehouses in the Inland Empire, port-adjacent property, and small last-mile delivery centers — still grapples with uncertainty. Jeff Jennison, president and CEO of Watson Land Company, told reporters that he’s seen South Bay industrial users, all solid credit tenants, hit pause starting in late April. “Decisions have stopped,” Jennison said, with meaningful expenditures delayed. “Most folks will delay any major decision-making if possible,” said David Fan, JLL’s Southern California senior research director. “A lot of major capital decisions, such as moving out or constructing a new facility, are wait and see.” The length of the tariffs, and whether they prove to be cudgels for trade deals, will impact different parts of the warehouse world differently. As Fan noted, large big-box retailers like Walmart have incredibly complex and detailed logistics operations. If the current scenario drags on — and it was dragging as Commercial Observer went to press — these retailers will be more apt to quickly reduce their footprint. Part of the response depends on how tariffs impact consumer spending and consumption. March data, Fan noted, showed an uptick, in part due to shoppers stocking up. A quick end to these charges, and trade deals that lock in certainty, could lead to soaring stocks, renewed spending, and a bullwhip effect where demand for warehouse space surges. “If you’re looking for big-box space that lends itself to 3PL, especially China, that’s going to be a tough go,” said Brett Turner, senior managing director of acquisitions and dispositions for BKM Capital Partners, which operates a portfolio of small-bay spaces. (3PL is the industry shorthand for third-party logistics.) “If you’re smaller, and your space lends itself to American manufacturing, I think you’re going to be in a really, really good spot.” Preparation also helps, and the warehouse industry has been bracing for impact for months. Chinese 3PL providers like Alibaba and JD.Com went on a leasing spree in anticipation of supply chain challenges. Such providers made up more than half of leasing activity in Los Angeles and the Inland Empire during the second half of 2024, and fully 80 percent in the fourth quarter alone. Coming after the regional warehouse industry had overbuilt and started to see the kind of depressed rents and slowdowns that signaled a (relative) space glut in 2023 — average vacancy was 2.7 percent in 2023, about half the 5.1 percent seen this year — this overzealous planning helped normalize the market, slashing vacancy and restoring supply-demand balance. The leasing activity during the first three months of 2025, 13.9 million square feet according to CBRE, was 62.5 percent higher than the same period last year and 20.7 percent over last year’s quarterly average. Coming after the COVID supply chain crises, which led to a shift toward stockpiling and safer supply chains — less just-in-time and more just-in-case — makes the industry more prepared. “COVID made these businesses realize that customer acquisition cost is hugely important, and if you screw up your supply chain and can’t deliver product to your customers, it’s going to cost you a lot of money,” BKM’s Turner said. “I think we’re pretty well prepared to go through this. I don’t know that it’s the best policy, and you can argue that all day, but if there’s a time that America can deal with it from an industrial supply standpoint, it’s now.” Fan also tracked end-of-year expansion from blue-chip clients and American retail firms, many of which felt bullish on the tax cuts and fiscal stimulus they expected from the then-incoming Trump administration. On its recent earnings calls, Prologis noted that companies like Amazon, Home Depot and FedEx have in recent months all been rushing in goods and seeking out overflow space. Deferred tenant decisions, in the short term, will impact net absorption rate in Q2 and beyond, predicted John Nahas, managing director of L.A.-based Rexford Industrial, which operates a 51 million-square-foot portfolio of smaller spaces in the region. He doesn’t see tariffs totally stalling the market — Rexford itself saw more absorption in Q1 than during the back half of last year — but the impact remains unpredictable. Tenants who have worked hard to establish supply chains won’t just jump out of leases, said Nahas, because there’s no tariff clause. His firm has roughly 11.2 percent of its portfolio subject to renewals in 2025, and he’s not alarmed. At the same time, many of the bigger tenants and big-box players will be attuned to the way tariffs hit American consumers. JLL’s Fan called the sector a sensitive barometer of economic activity, with retailers sure to rapidly adjust inventory and warehouse utilization. Right now, rents are declining, vacancies are increasing, and 6.6 million square feet of warehouses remain under construction in the Greater Los Angeles area, so significant shifts would ripple throughout the industry. “There’s been a higher percentage of economists saying there’s a higher chance of recession, and most of our markets are geared toward consumption rather than manufacturing,” he said. “To that extent, we will be impacted.” Fan said he’s keeping his eyes on the Chinese 3PL leases, which now lease about 4 percent of the total SoCal market. Since American consumers spend so much more than their overseas counterparts, Chinese firms are keen to establish more trade here, and have signed long-term leases during their recent attempt to shore up space. If tariffs last long enough for them to run through their pre-positioned inventory, their next moves will have a big impact. The fundamentals of the market could carry the sector through a sure-to-be unsteady year, Fan said. And the long-term push toward logistics efficiency will hopefully lead firms to make investments to optimize their delivery strategy — Amazon just announced a potential $15 billion nationwide investment in new facilities, for instance. Hopefully, faster, better and cheaper still matter. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Big Tech's new playbook: Trim the fat; pay the stars
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-giants-overhaul-pay-rewarding-stars-scrutinizing-underachievers-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-08T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Big Tech is rewriting the rules this year: Top talent gets big rewards, while underperformers face the heat. The latest to follow suit is Amazon, which recently overhauled its compensation model to reward long-running top performers with larger payouts. Four years at the highest performance rank now pays off big with 110% of the pay band, which exceeds the previous 100% cap. But employees who achieve the top rank for the first time take a hit, with total comp cut to 70% of the pay range, down from last year's 80%. The move is part of a broader tech trend of using performance reviews and compensation to better incentivize high achievers and eliminate underperformers and their drag on the balance book. Big Tech firms, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have made similar changes, all in pursuit of leaner, top-tier teams. These companies handed out lavish perks, pampering, and sky-high salaries to stay competitive. A pandemic-era hiring spree exacerbated a tech tradition of hoarding top talent and only added to the ranks. Now, a shift makes one thing clear: It's no longer about head count — it's about talent. The changes go hand in hand with sweeping pivots across tech to replace perks and pampering with performance and efficiency. Big Tech still rewards workers handsomely, but the era of resting and vesting at the giants may be well and truly over. "The industry overall has made big efforts to do more with less," Brian Nguyen, a product manager at the salary data platform Levels.fyi, told Business Insider. "This has allowed them to scale back costs while pushing for higher-quality work with fewer employees and rewards for only the top-tier performers." Google declined to comment, and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI about its low-performer cuts: "Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance." The new approach "creates a steadier compensation progression for employees as they develop within their roles," an Amazon spokesperson said, adding the company offers "multiple channels" for employees to raise concerns about pay. Amazon managers this year received a list of potential pay-related questions and suggested answers, according to internal talking points obtained by BI. If asked about pay cuts, managers are encouraged to focus on employees getting raises for improved performance. "Employees moving to a higher OV level will generally receive an increase," one talking point said, referring to Amazon's performance rating called overall value. "This ensures an appropriate distinction between newer and consistently high-performing employees at each OV level." At Google, a larger share of employees can now earn top performance ratings, which lead to bigger bonuses and equity. Managers have also been given the authority to hand out more discretionary rewards to employees who are excelling. But with a fixed budget, those gains come at the cost of lower-ranked employees, reinforcing the company's focus on high performance and raising the stakes for those falling behind. "High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors," John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, told staff in a memo last week. Microsoft, meanwhile, has rolled out policies aimed at enhancing performance management and addressing what the company calls "low performers." Managers also received "more transparency and clarity" in the rewards process, an internal note seen by BI said. The change came after the company laid off 2,000 employees deemed to be underperforming earlier this year. Meta has ramped up what it calls performance-based cuts, aiming to shed about 5% of its lowest-rated staff. An internal memo revealed plans to make these layoffs annual under a "non-regrettable attrition" policy. Adding to the sting, some ex-employees — even high performers — have landed on internal block lists, barring them from being rehired. While these companies are weighing an employee's performance rating history more heavily, some are also reducing new-hire offers. In 2022, Amazon regularly offered over $300,000 a year to newly hired midlevel software engineers, according to data from Levels.fyi. Nowadays, more offers land around $270,000 a year, with recruiters being especially strict about needing "extra approvals" for anything higher, said Levels.fyi's Nguyen. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are taking a similar approach, he added. Switching jobs no longer helps either. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker shows that median pay increases for job switchers dropped to 4.2% in February, down sharply from 7.3% in early 2023. Tech professionals, in particular, are feeling the heat with lower pay offers and significant pay cuts, BI previously reported, as reduced competition has weakened employees' bargaining power. Not everyone is sold that the shift to crack down on underperformance is here to stay. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI that many companies follow these trends simply because "others are doing them," cycling through similar changes every decade or so. "These are just fads," Capelli said. Still, the changes haven't gone unnoticed. At one Amazon office, some employees quietly voiced their frustration on an elevator whiteboard, a photo of which was shared with BI. "No raise, no RSUs — thanks!" the whiteboard read, referring to the lack of employee stock awards. "Do more with less." Have a tip?

Title: Sell AMD Stock Amid China Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/08/sell-amd-stock-amid-china-risk/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 04: In this photo illustration, the logo of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ... More (AMD) is displayed on a smartphone screen, with a stock market chart in the background, on May 4, 2025, in Chongqing, China. AMD is a leading American semiconductor company known for its high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies, including CPUs and GPUs widely used in gaming, data centers, and AI applications. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock appears relatively costly at its current valuation of approximately $99. We have identified some minor issues with AMD stock that make the present valuation seem a bit high, although there are numerous opportunities as well. AMD recently released a set of Q1 results that surpassed expectations, and its outlook for Q2 was also more favorable than anticipated. Revenue increased by 36% to $7.44 billion in Q1, while earnings reached $0.96 per share. Growth was propelled by robust data center sales, which rose 57% to $3.7 billion, driven by a rise in GPU and CPU shipments. AMD's CPUs have been capturing market share from Intel in the data center sector for quite some time. While AMD’s GPU chips do not match Nvidia’s chips at the premium level, the AI boom is stimulating the entire market, with emerging large-scale models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and China’s DeepSeek R1 projected to generate increased demand for GPUs. AMD’s client segment experienced a revenue increase of 68% to $2.3 billion. Overall, AMD anticipates that new chips set to launch soon will aid in enhancing sales during the latter half of the year. However, China presents a challenge for the company. AMD expects that U.S. restrictions on sales to China will result in a loss of $1.5 billion in revenue this year due to export restrictions imposed in April aimed at AMD's MI308 chips. AMD also warns of a potential charge of up to $800 million linked to inventory, purchase commitments, and reserves due to the newly enforced export controls. The new U.S. restrictions on chip sales necessitate a license to ship advanced artificial intelligence processors to China. AMD stated that it intends to apply for these export licenses, but it has also warned that there is no guarantee that these licenses will be approved. This presents a headwind for the stock since China constitutes about 24% of AMD's revenue. Our evaluation of Advanced Micro Devices against key metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company maintains a strong operational performance and financial health, as elaborated below, although its valuation is somewhat elevated. That being said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and produced returns exceeding 91% since its inception. When considering what you are paying per dollar of sales or profit, AMD stock appears very pricey compared to the overall market. • Advanced Micro Devices has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.0 compared to a figure of 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio stands at 51.3 in comparison to 17.6 for the S&P 500 • In addition, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 95.0 versus the benchmark's 24.5 Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have seen significant growth in recent years. • Advanced Micro Devices has experienced its top line grow at an average rate of 17.8% over the past 3 years (compared to an increase of 6.2% for the S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 13.7% from $23 billion to $26 billion over the last 12 months (compared to growth of 5.3% for the S&P 500) • Additionally, its quarterly revenues grew 24.2% to $7.7 billion in the most recent quarter compared to $6.2 billion a year ago (versus a 4.9% improvement for the S&P 500) Advanced Micro Devices’ profit margins are considerably worse than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. • Advanced Micro Devices’ Operating Income for the last four quarters was $2.1 billion, which signifies a poor Operating Margin of 8.1% (in contrast to 13.1% for the S&P 500) • Advanced Micro Devices’ Operating Cash Flow (OCF) during this timeframe was $3.0 billion, indicative of a poor OCF Margin of 11.8% (versus 15.7% for the S&P 500) • For the last four-quarter period, Advanced Micro Devices’ Net Income totaled $1.6 billion, which represents a poor Net Income Margin of 6.4% (while 11.3% for the S&P 500) Advanced Micro Devices’ balance sheet appears solid. • Advanced Micro Devices’ Debt figure was $2.2 billion at the close of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $160 billion (as of 5/6/2025). This results in a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.4% (in comparison to 21.5% for the S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferable] • Cash (inclusive of cash equivalents) accounts for $5.1 billion of the $69 billion in Total Assets for Advanced Micro Devices. This leads to a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.4% (compared to 15.0% for the S&P 500) AMD stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the influence of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a comprehensive analysis of how the stock has behaved during and after prior market crashes. • AMD stock declined 65.4% from a peak of $161.91 on 29 November 2021 to $55.94 on 14 October 2022, whereas the S&P 500 experienced a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 January 2024 • Since that time, the stock has risen to a maximum of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and is currently trading at around $99 • AMD stock decreased 34.3% from a height of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough reduction of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 July 2020 • AMD stock dropped 91.2% from a high of $20.35 on 1 January 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, as opposed to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 21 August 2018 In conclusion, Advanced Micro Devices' performance across the various parameters elaborated above can be summarized as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Weak • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Very Weak • Overall: Neutral However, given its extremely high valuation, the stock appears relatively pricey, which reinforces our assertion that AMD is a costly stock to purchase. The elevated valuation of AMD stock restricts its upside potential in the near- to mid-term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver impressive returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced blend of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets take a downturn, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Google on May 6 laid off at least 200 people in sales and partnerships roles across its global business unit, according to a report by The Information, citing sources. The report was also carried by Reuters, who in a statement from the company reported that Google is “making small number of changes across teams”, which are aimed at increased collaboration and customer service. Notably, Silicon Valley tech giants are increasingly prioritising development of artificial intelligence (AI) and allocation for data centres that run their AI tools, while scaling back on other investments, the Reuters report added. Last month, on April 10, Google laid off hundreds of employees working in its platforms and devices division, which includes work on Android OS, Chrome browser, and Pixel phones, sources told The Information. On April 15, Business Standard reported that these jobs included some roles at Google's Bengaluru and Hyderabad offices. The sources cited in the report also claimed that Google plans to cut jobs in India across advertisement, marketing and sales. In a statement to The Information, a Google spokesperson said: “Since combining the Platforms and Devices teams last year, we’ve focused on becoming more nimble and operating more effectively and this included making some job reductions in addition to the voluntary exit program that we offered in January.” Since January 2023, Google has laid off at least 12,000 employees, or 6 per cent of its global workforce. This was announced by parent company Alphabet. As of December 2024, the tech giant had 1,83.323 employees, the report said. Alphabet is not alone. In January 2025, Mark Zuckerberg-led Facebook parent company Meta Platforms cut 5 per cent employees, it said were the “lowest performers”, it added. The company also announced increased hiring of machine learning engineers. In September 2024, Microsoft gave pink slips to 650 Xbox employees, while Apple cut 100 jobs, and Amazon laid off whole units last year, the Reuters report added.

Key points: Supply chain expert warns of "asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs" disruption as U.S.-China trade war escalates Chinese imports to US expected to plunge 80%, triggering historic shortages, price spikes, and mass layoffs Trump's 25% auto parts tariffs deepen crisis as experts warn: "Even if a deal happens, recovery could take a year" Southern California's port-dependent economy faces devastation, with "one in five jobs" at risk The U.S. and much of the industrialized world are now entrenched in a historic trade war â a conflict intensified by President Donald Trumpâs policies but ultimately inevitable due to past U.S. administrations losing key negotiations with other nations. These earlier failures set the stage for economic decline, as businesses shuttered and corporations relocated overseas in search of more favorable conditions. Now, in a desperate bid for survival, the U.S. government is waging high-stakes trade battles, deploying aggressive tariffs to pressure other nations into compliance. This strategy underscores the dollarâs weakening dominance and the decline of American manufacturing, as countries increasingly abandon reliance on the worldâs reserve currency to forge their own economic alliances. The coming supply chain apocalypse The warning signs are already flashing red. Container shipments from China to the U.S. have plummeted 60% since April, with major retailers now burning through stockpiled inventory. Once those reserves vanish â likely within weeks â Americans will face barren shelves, rationing, and hyperinflation on everyday goods. Smaller businesses, already struggling, are the canaries in the coal mine. The crisis is exacerbated by decades of U.S, economic malpractice, where corrupt administrations outsourced critical manufacturing to China, leaving the nation defenseless. Now, as Trumpâs tariffs sever trade ties, thereâs no quick fix. "It takes years to build new factories," notes one analyst. "How do we replace $438 billion in Chinese imports?" The answer: We canât. Economic carnage and the betrayal of American workers Southern Californiaâs ports â the lifeline of U.S. commerce â are ground zero for the coming disaster. Gary Herrera of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union warns that "one in every five jobs" in the region is tied to port activity, with ripple effects crushing warehouse workers, truckers, and rail operators. The Inland Empire, a hub for Walmart and Amazon, faces economic ruin. Even if Trump secures a deal tomorrow, supply chains wonât recover for 9â12 months, says Altana Technologies CEO Evan Smith. But China refuses to negotiate under coercion, and Trumpâs latest tariffs â like the auto parts levy â signal no retreat. "The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system," Smith adds, "and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain." A nation on the brink: Prepare now or suffer later This is not a drill. The global trade war has arrived, and its consequences will dwarf the COVID-era disruptions. The Federal Reserveâs reckless money-printing has already devalued the dollar, and now, supply chain chaos will ignite inflation like a powder keg. Those who fail to prepare â stockpiling essentials, securing alternative income, or converting savings to gold â will be left at the mercy of a collapsing system. As the radical left fuels unrest and the deep state plots its next move, one truth is undeniable: The America we knew is gone. Will this crisis finally awaken the public to the corruption that brought us here â or will they keep rioting, looting, and begging for government handouts as the shelves go bare? Additional Reading: Why the Trump administration will FAIL, and Americaâs economy, military and industrial base will COLLAPSE if Trumpâs weaponized tariffs arenât halted.

Title: The Art of the Price Hike

Time Published: 2025-05-07T22:05:00Z

Trump’s tariff plan has pushed America’s businesses into a nightmarish experiment. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Maxwell Cohen knew the tariffs were coming. President Donald Trump had openly threatened a trade war on the campaign trail, and Cohen, an entrepreneur, heeded his words. His company, Peelaways, sells disposable and waterproof fitted bed sheets made in China that are popular with at-home and family caregivers. There’s only so much price elasticity for disposable goods, so he prepared to absorb what he estimated would be roughly 15 to 30 percent tariffs, setting aside money to bring in more inventory before prices skyrocketed. It would hurt, but it would be doable. He thought he had the numbers mostly worked out. But when man plans, Trump laughs. The latest figure for the administration’s tariffs on China sits at 145 percent. Prices are expected to keep climbing for some goods; last week, Trump closed the de minimis loophole for China and Hong Kong, which had exempted them from paying tariffs on shipments of goods worth $800 or less, and wide-ranging tariffs are still set to go into effect for many countries. For any business that can’t swallow an unanticipated and possibly huge price increase on imports, the first step is deciding if it will pass the cost to the consumer. If the answer is yes—as it often is—the next decision is how, or whether, to let the customers know. Tariff transparency recently made headlines on the domestic front of Trump’s trade war. After Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering adding a line showing the cost of tariffs for each product on its site, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held a public shaming of the company from her briefing-room podium, calling the move “a hostile and political act.” CNN reported that a “pissed” Trump called Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder. The company’s representatives soon denied ever approving the idea, adding that it was never a consideration for Amazon’s main site but rather for its spin-off store, Haul. Although big, name-brand American companies are most likely to incur the administration’s wrath over displaying tariff surcharges, other businesses have tough choices to make on how to go about raising prices. The result is a choose-your-own-adventure exercise in managing public perception. Screenshots of the checkout page of the online clothing company Triangl went viral for the astronomical “duties” surcharge. Temu, a Chinese e-commerce giant, added import charges to certain products on its site. Luxury brands aren’t immune, either: Hermès announced price increases for American buyers to offset the tariffs, and Prada plans to raise prices by an undetermined amount later in the summer. Meanwhile, some business leaders aren’t mincing words. Jolie Skin Co, an American shower-filter brand, told The Information that a “Trump liberation tariff” line will be added to checkout pages. “Technically WE are not raising our prices,” the company’s CEO and founder, Ryan Babenzien, wrote on LinkedIn. “We think transparency is the way to go here and I am giving Trump full credit for his decision.” Transparency is a high-wire act. Tariffs is such a politically loaded word that some companies hesitate to invoke it, out of fear of alienating their customer base—or inciting the administration’s ire. But pointing a finger at tariffs can also help shift blame. Increasing prices without any clear explanation risks appearing opportunistic, Mike Michalowicz, a small-business expert, told me. All it takes is for some businesses to get caught profiteering before “the customer becomes suspect of not just them but of everybody.” The gaming industry is a prime example. Nintendo has a large manufacturing presence in China, and last month, it announced that the Switch 2 console would launch at the original price, but some of the accessories will cost more than previously expected. The company’s representatives attributed the update to “changes in market conditions.” If that phrase sounds familiar, it’s almost word for word the explanation Microsoft offered after announcing Xbox price hikes last week, which will run as high as $100 more for some models in America. The absence of the T-word is a glaring omission. Such muddy messaging may help insulate companies from the administration’s spite, but it invites backlash from customers who are quick to blame the good old-fashioned motive of corporate greed. If some companies fear appearing opportunistic, others are trying to cash in while they still can. Marketing 101 teaches you to distinguish your company from your competitors, and Business 101 says to move inventory before the economy goes kaput. What better way to do both than to slash prices when everybody else is raising them? “Pre-tariff” sales are cropping up at furniture companies, fashion retailers, and carmakers. Their underlying message: Get it before you can’t afford it. Ford’s latest campaign, “From America. For America,” is trying to strike an optimistic tone. As Audi pauses car imports to the United States, and automakers hem and haw over price changes, Ford has been running an ad since last month touting employee-priced vehicles and their company’s deep roots in American industry. It’s a strategic ploy—already, Ford has reported double-digit sales increases (although an analysis from CarEdge found that some of Ford’s more popular vehicles had better deals in March, before employee pricing went into effect). Other carmakers that manufacture models in America, including Mercedes and BMW, are promising to temporarily eat the cost of tariffs for some vehicles to keep prices from rising. But an expiration date for this generosity could be imminent: Last week, Ford’s CEO went on CNN and couldn’t say if prices would increase in the summertime. With so much left uncertain in Trump’s trade war, some small businesses are down to the wire. Many of them don’t have the cash to stockpile inventory or the storage space to keep it. The owners of the American vegan-cheese company Rebel Cheese have roughly a month to decide what to do. Much of their cheese relies on fair-trade cashews imported from Vietnam, which faces the threat of 46 percent tariffs, and their inventory is dwindling. The company already went through a round of layoffs a few weeks ago; at this point, adding at least a 10 percent price increase seems inevitable, Fred Zwar, one of the co-founders, told me. They are considering breaking down the numbers for customers when they announce the change, but the sharp fluctuations of Trump’s tariffs make the timing tricky: “We can’t do a price raise today and then say, Hey, they raised it another 90 percent. We need to do another price raise tomorrow,” Zwar said. All of this feels like déjà vu for Peelaways. Cohen dealt with Trump’s seesawing tariffs during his first term, which also coincided with COVID-19’s economic downturn. He laid off all six of his workers and restructured his business in order to stay afloat, leaving him with two C-suite executives overseas. This time around, he’s running a leaner operation and slowly raising prices $1 a week until he hits a 15 percent increase. His plan is to test different newsletters to measure his customer base’s feedback: One will include the standard fare (caregiver tips, customer reviews), and the other will acknowledge the tariffs’ effects on pricing. But even having gone through this before, Cohen can’t be sure he’ll make it out again. “We’re all just holding our breath,” he said, waiting for “whatever the next tweet brings.” Related: Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Today’s News Evening Read The Real Motive Behind the Real ID–Deadline Charade By Juliette Kayyem Today’s deadline was largely artificial: According to the fine print of the regulations governing Real ID’s implementation, Homeland Security has until the end of 2027 to phase in the program in full.

Arm Holdings (ARM) delivered an outlook that came in below analysts' expectations, sending shares lower in extended trading Wednesday. The chip designer and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it anticipates fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents to 38 cents, short of the 41 cents called for by Wall Street, according to Visible Alpha.

The stock is up less than 1% so far in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. In its fiscal fourth quarter, Arm posted record revenue of $1.24 billion, up 34% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted net income was $584 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $376 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier, surpassing Wall Street’s estimates. Arm's royalty revenue improved 18% to a record $607 million, while its license and other revenue gained 53% to $634 million.

Shares in Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) are dipping sharply amid comments from tech giant Apple suggesting that artificial intelligence (AI) will threaten the dominance of the top search engine. Apple’s services chief Eddie Cue says he believes AI-run search engines will eventually replace the classic search engines like Google, Bloomberg reports. Speaking in a testimony during the US Justice Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc, Cue said he expects Apple will use services from OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic as search options in Apple’s Safari browser in the future. “Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices… I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.” Currently, Google has been paying Apple as much as $20 billion a year to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser. Following Cue’s testimony and the subsequent uncertainty of Google’s future dominance, the tech giant’s stock collapsed, wiping out over $200 billion in market cap. At time of writing, GOOG is down 10.4% on the day, currently trading at $149. Cue added that for AI search engines to improve, they will need better indexing, but even if they can’t achieve that, they will likely soon have features that are “so much better that people will switch.” Says Cue, referring to the switch from standard to AI-based search engines, “There’s enough money now, enough large players, that I don’t see how it doesn’t happen.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In March, the company reported ending ARR of $4.24 billion as of Jan. 31. CrowdStrike expects to incur between $36 million and $53 million in layoff-related charges, including $7 million in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, the filing said. The company plans to report current-quarter results on June 3, with those charges excluded from its adjusted figures. The company added it sees Q1 results "in-line with or above" its March guidance and affirmed its full-year outlook. In a letter to employees, CEO George Kurtz said CrowdStrike is at a "market and technology inflection point, with AI reshaping every industry." "AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster," Kurtz added. "It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office." Shares of CrowdStrike fell 5% in recent trading but are up 23% in 2025.

Title: Saylor Pressures Microsoft To Join Bitcoin Revolution With $75 Billion Bet
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-microsoft-bitcoin-75-billion-bet/
Time Published: 2025-05-07T14:30:05Z
Full Content:
At the Bitcoin for Corporations 2025, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor turned his keynote into a direct challenge for one of the technology sector’s most cash-rich giants. Speaking to an audience of chief financial officers and treasury executives, he argued that Microsoft should shift tens of billions of dollars from share buybacks and short-dated Treasuries into Bitcoin, calling the cryptocurrency “the universal, perpetual, profitable merger partner” that outclasses every other treasury asset in the artificial-intelligence age. Saylor framed the comparison starkly. “Microsoft is up 18% a year for the past five years. Bitcoin is up 62%,” he said, adding that the S&P 500’s compound growth rate of roughly 14% defines the hurdle rate by which corporate capital allocation is judged. “Normalize everything against that cost of capital and you discover Microsoft’s real out-performance is 4%. Bitcoin’s is 48%. Bonds are negative. Why would you hold the thing that’s destroying capital when the apex asset is compounding almost 50% above the cost of money?” He then zeroed in on Microsoft’s current balance sheet mix. “If Microsoft buys bonds, you’re destroying 99.7% of your capital over ten years,” he declared. “Buying your own stock is only marginally less catastrophic—you’re vaporizing 97%. Buying Bitcoin would be ten times better than buying back MSFT.” Saylor’s argument rests on his conviction that Bitcoin inaugurates a third monetary epoch. “Gold was nineteenth-century money; sovereign debt was twentieth-century money. Bitcoin is twenty-first-century money—the first liquid, fungible capital asset with no counterparty,” he said. He dates the institutional “year zero” for Bitcoin to 2024, “the moment the SEC blessed spot ETFs and FASB signaled fair-value accounting.” By that chronology, 2025 is “year one” and the window for first-mover advantage is already narrowing. To quantify the upside, Saylor revealed that his team ran Microsoft through the open-source “Bitcoin 24” treasury-modeling tool. Four scenarios were stress-tested: sweeping excess cash into Bitcoin, substituting dividends for coin purchases, replacing buybacks with accumulation, and adding a thin layer of leverage. “Depending on the mix, it adds anywhere from $155 to $584 a share—one to five trillion dollars in enterprise value—while taking less risk,” he said. “I’m asking you to stop surrendering the capital you just spent five years winning.” The emotionally charged moments of the keynote came when Saylor linked treasury policy to operational strain. “When you divest yourself of $200 billion, you amplify every risk factor in your own prospectus,” he warned. “You put massive pressure on your employees, then on your customers—lock them into three-year contracts, force them to buy everything when they only want some things—then your competitors complain and the regulators sue you. All of it because you’re chasing quarterly volatility you could hedge instantly by holding a non-correlated hard asset.” He pressed the point with a thought experiment aimed squarely at Microsoft’s board. “If you could buy a hundred-billion-dollar company growing 60% a year at one-times revenue, would you do it? What if you could do it every year, forever?” he asked. “That’s Bitcoin. The irony is that the least risky acquisition imaginable is perceived as risky by consensus finance.” 🇺🇸 MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST CALLED MICROSOFT TO BUY $75 BILLION OF #BITCOIN AND MAKE $4 TRILLION IT’S COMING!!! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/ujyHwquA0e — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 6, 2025 Saylor reserved his longest uninterrupted passage for a final appeal: “Rich people are not rich because of a future expectation of cash flows; they’re rich because they own hard assets. I would rather be invested in a rich company than in a company that gives away its money and promises to work ever harder and raise prices on customers ad infinitum.” He added: “You can cling to twentieth-century capital—treasury bills, stock buybacks, dividends—or you can embrace the future, capitalize on Bitcoin, and turn a decapitalization spiral into progressive growth. It’s good for your customers, your employees, your shareholders, your country, and your legacy. Adopt Bitcoin.” The shorthand $75 billion bet circulating in conference corridors reflects Microsoft’s authorized buyback and two years of forward dividends folded into a single digital-asset allocation. Notably, Microsoft shareholders voted against a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet during the firm’s meeting on December 10. At press time, BTC traded at $96,521.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Michael Snyder | May 7, 2025 | Conspiracy Fact and Theory | 1 comment This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now, expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that, shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course, anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone who cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs anytime soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI GUANGZHOU, CHINA - APRIL 30: Passengers have their body temperature measured before taking a WeRide ... More L4 autonomous driving bus on April 30, 2022 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China. Passengers can experience the driverless bus line in Guangzhou, which opens for a test ride from Saturday. (Photo by Chen Jimin/China News Service via Getty Images) Updated, May 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include information from Uber's Q1 2025 earnings report. Shares in WeRide, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology provider, popped 40% Tuesday, according to Google Finance. Why? The $2.6 billion market capitalization company is partnering with Uber — which is adding $100 million to its investment in WeRide — to expand its robotaxi services from Abu Dhabi to 15 more cities worldwide by 2030, according to CnEV Post. Should investors buy WeRide stock? Although the company’s revenue fell in 2024 and its losses are huge, Uber’s vote of confidence in WeRide could contribute to significant growth and ultimate profitability. WeRide — which operates a driverless commercial Robotaxi service in Beijing and does business in 10 countries — suffered a decline in revenue and a substantial loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call transcript. More specifically, in the fourth quarter WeRide’s revenue fell 3% to $15.8 million coupled with a 112% increase in the company’s net loss to $34 million, noted the earnings call transcript. WeRide has the potential to grow rapidly — with positive contribution margins — aided by local partnerships. Outside China, the company provides “autonomous vehicles and services to local partners and global platforms through a combination of selling the vehicles, charging a fixed service fee, and a revenue-sharing arrangement,” WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li told investors in the earnings call. To be sure, WeRide faces challenges when it introduces autonomous vehicles in a new location. To overcome those challenges, WeRide builds up mutual trust — gradually introducing “automobile driving products, like we can always introduce RoboSweeper at first, and also fixed-route minibus, which the challenges for safety for this product relatively low compared to the requirements for Robotaxi,” WeRide CEO Tony Han told investors, according to the earnings call. This trust has scaled sufficiently for Uber to expand its partnership with WeRide. By 2030, Uber — which already operates a robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, with Dubai next in line — will roll out WeRide’s Robotaxi services in “15 new cities across Europe and other regions outside of China and the U.S.,” noted TipRanks. The Uber-WeRide partnership splits up the work of operating robotaxis between the two companies based on their mutual strengths. WeRide provides the self-driving technology, while Uber integrates the service into its app and manages fleet operations, TipRanks reported. WeRide offers another advantages to Uber’s efforts to expand autonomous services globally. That’s because WeRide’s presence in 30 cities across 10 countries includes “test licenses in China, UAE, Singapore, France, and the U.S.,” TipRanks reported, which will make it easier for Uber to overcome regulatory barriers to entry in key markets. Uber has other robotaxi partnerships with Waymo, Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora in the U.S. as well as international partnerships with Pony.AI and Momenta, reported CNBC. Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta. Based on analysts’ price targets, WeRide stock has more upside than Uber. Two analysts who cover WeRide set an average price target of $22, according to Zack’s — representing 133% upside. Meanwhile, Uber — which just reported first quarter 2025 results — has less upside. More specifically, the ride-booking giant’s stock has 5.6% upside based on the average price target of 33 analysts of $90.20, noted TipRanks. Uber’s stock fell 1.3% in May 7 trading after reporting a mixed result – in which the company’s revenue fell short of expectations while its earnings per share beat them. Specifically, Uber’s Q1 revenue of $11.53 billion fell $100 million short of London Stock Exchange Group expectations, according to CNBC, while Q1 earnings per share of 80 cents beat analysts’ views by 33 cents. The company’s Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as measured by the number completed trips per day, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC. With the global market for robotaxi services growing at an 80.8% average annual rate to $119 billion by 2031, according to Fortune Business Insights, WeRide stock may have further room to rise with help from the Uber partnership.

Title: What’s Happening With Arista Stock?

More mobile phone screen with the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Despite posting impressive quarterly results, Arista Networks (NASDAQ: ANET) saw an unexpected market reaction. The company delivered solid numbers with sales reaching $2.0 billion (up 27.6% year-over-year) and adjusted earnings of $0.65 per share (up from $0.50 last year). Both figures beat Wall Street expectations of $1.97 billion in sales and $0.59 EPS. As an aside, will Tesla get back to basics? See Tesla’s Lost Cause. Adding to the good news, Arista’s Q2 outlook of $2.1 billion exceeded consensus estimates, and they announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program. Normally, these would be ingredients for a stock rally, but instead, ANET dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Clearly, ANET stock is volatile, and if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – What’s Next For HIMS Stock After A Solid Q1? So what happened? Investors were clearly hoping for even more, especially considering major tech companies have maintained their AI-related capital expenditure plans. The question now: Does it make sense to buy ANET at $86 (after-hours price)? We think absolutely. At $86 (after market), ANET trades at 15x trailing revenues, just slightly above its three-year average P/S ratio of 14x. We believe a higher valuation multiple is justified given Arista’s strong position in the AI space, with companies like Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google making up a significant portion of sales while remaining committed to AI expansion. With sales growth projected in the high teens over the next few years, the premium valuation makes sense. Bottom line: Investors should consider using this dip in ANET stock as an opportunity to buy for solid long-term gains. For investors aiming to reduce the inherent volatility associated with individual stocks like Arista Networks, there are alternative investment strategies available. The Trefis RV strategy, which has a history of outperforming its all-cap stock benchmark, provides a diversified approach to potentially achieve solid returns. Likewise, the High-Quality portfolio has shown superior performance compared to the S&P 500 with returns that exceed 91% since its initiation, offering potential upside with reduced stock-specific risk.

Today is the start of the REAL ID requirement at airport security checkpoints, but if you don’t have one, don’t panic. Most people will still be allowed to fly, according to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A standard, state-issued driver’s license is no longer enough to get through security—you’ll need one that typically has a star in the upper right corner, though each state’s version looks different. And while you may get through security without a REAL ID, it could mean going through extra screening, so plan to arrive three hours ahead of your flight. The requirement, aimed at improving security, has been long-delayed. But if you have a passport or one of roughly a dozen other compliant forms of identification, there’s no need to rush on obtaining a REAL ID. An army soldier stands guard on the rooftop of a mosque building damaged by a suspected Indian ... More missile attack near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan controlled Kashmir. (AP Photo/M.D. Mughal) India launched missile strikes in Pakistan Wednesday, two weeks after it accused Pakistan of being involved in a terrorist attack on the tourist town of Pahalgam that killed over two dozen people. Pakistani officials denounced the strikes, calling them “an unprovoked and blatant act of war.” The nuclear-armed nations have been at odds for decades, but tensions have risen in recent weeks following the Pahalgam attack. Even as AI models become more advanced, they’re increasingly prone to hallucinations, or false information created by false reasoning, presenting a challenge for the industry. For instance, company tests show OpenAI’s newest o3 and o4-mini models have hallucinated 30-50% of the time, and it’s unclear why. U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell Despite demands from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates as the central bank’s rate-setting committee meets this week. Economists at the three largest investment banks all predict the Fed will keep rates steady as it grapples with inflation that remains above its 2% target. Legal AI startup Legora is in talks to raise $85 million in funding at a $675 million valuation, following a string of deals with big name law firms. The firm’s software helps lawyers draft contracts, review and analyze documents, and run checks against legal databases, automating some of the most repetitive and tedious tasks for attorneys. Amazon-owned robotaxi firm Zoox has issued a software recall for 270 of its vehicles after an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi collided with a passenger vehicle in Las Vegas last month. The incident didn’t result in any injuries, and the robotaxis are back on the road, but it adds to a series of challenges for the fledgling industry. The Trump Organization disclosed in a filing submitted to British regulators that President Donald Trump retains influence over the trust that controls one of his U.K. golf resorts and, via a web of additional entities, virtually every other asset in his empire. By stating that Trump has control over the trust, his own business appears to admit that Trump maintains a grip on his business empire, despite some efforts to portray separation. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump Administration’s transgender military ban to take effect again while a legal case against it moves forward. A lower court had paused the policy, but it is now in effect until it potentially comes back to the highest court again. an airport control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport Newly released audio reveals that air traffic controllers temporarily lost all contact with planes approaching Newark Airport on April 28. Following the incident, some air traffic controllers took time off, and a shortage of controllers has caused hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at the airport over the past week. In recent days, President Donald Trump and top advisor Stephen Miller have suggested immigrants may not be entitled to due process before being deported, as the Trump Administration faces pushback over its mass deportation plans. But that conflicts with longstanding legal precedent: In 1993, conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that “the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.” For a variety of reasons, elite college admissions are becoming an impossible dream—even for perfect students. Today, 19 of 20 applications submitted to nearly all of the schools in the Ivy League are rejected. And it’s not just the super elite: Admission rates are plunging at popular schools like Northeastern University and New York University. Lower admissions rates lead to more stress and more heartbreak. But while the traditional May 1 decision deadline has come and gone, it’s not too late to secure a college acceptance for the fall term. Through April and May, hundreds of colleges report to the National Association for College Admission Counselors that they still have seats available in their incoming freshman classes. As of Wednesday, 281 colleges told NACAC they’re still seeking applicants. Many of these colleges are excellent, and in an effort to highlight the best colleges in need of freshmen, Forbes has culled the list for schools that appear on the 2025 Forbes Top Colleges list, as well as the Princeton Review’s 2025 list of Best Colleges. One option is the University of San Francisco, a private Jesuit university that is popular for health professions programs. And if internships are a goal, Philadelphia’s Drexel University, with 12,000 undergraduates and 100 majors and minors, is known for its co-op program, which places students in paying jobs for six-month stints at employers like Comcast, Dupont, Estee Lauder, Vanguard and Johnson & Johnson. WHY IT MATTERS “Heading into high school graduation season without a college admission offer is disheartening, no doubt, but it’s not time to give up on college ambitions,” says Forbes staff writer Emma Whitford. “Students who didn’t get any college acceptances still have plenty of excellent schools to apply to for the fall, and a strong transfer application to your dream school next spring will fare better than a first-year application following a gap year.” MORE America’s Top Colleges If trade negotiations fall through, the European Union could consider placing additional tariffs on more than $110 billion in U.S. exports. That would impact everything from cars to oil and gas: $10 billion: The worth of new cars exported from the U.S. to the EU in 2023 3.5%: The share of all U.S. global exports that went to Germany in 2022 Nearly 1 million: The number of jobs in the U.S. supported by trade in services with the EU in 2023 With layoffs in the news, it’s natural to worry that your position could be on the chopping block. In a recent survey, HR directors and managers identified five red flags that could signal a role could be eliminated, including whether a position can be replaced by AI, or if the role relies on outdated skillsets. Consider making a career pivot that leverages your skills if your position is at risk of automation, and make sure to regularly assess your performance with your boss.

Title: When The CEO Is The Corporate Brand: How To Manage Reputational Risks

ByBrian Cattell ByBrian Cattell, Forbes Councils Member. Brian Cattell, Managing Partner at CLP Strategies, a strategic communications firm with offices in New York City and London. It’s not new for charismatic CEOs to be the face of the corporations they lead. In 2025, however, with many business leaders seeming to be either permanently on social media, on TV or quoted in the newspapers, many CEOs have effectively become the company brand. It’s not just the extreme examples like Elon Musk. More sober but still ubiquitous corporate titans such as Andy Jassy of Amazon, Jensen Huang of Nvidia or Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Today’s rapidly evolving ecosystem of new digital, social and legacy media platforms means that these executives are in the spotlight more than any others in corporate history. In many ways, today’s CEOs are behaving more like influencers. They comment on market trends, share views on AI and even weigh in on how everyday people spend their free time. Every post or statement is instantly shared, analyzed and judged. As a result, corporate communications teams must now manage not only the company’s brand but also a highly visible, human brand—one that’s imperfect, spontaneous and constantly speaking. Consider WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick’s infamous "let them eat cake" moment in 2024. In a CNBC interview, Pilnick suggested cereal as a low-cost dinner option amid rising food prices—claiming it could feed a family for just $1. The backlash was swift. His comments went viral, drawing sharp criticism online from people who saw the remarks as tone-deaf and out of touch. Although Pilnick—new to the role at the time—kept his job and WK Kellogg avoided lasting damage, it’s safe to assume his communications team likely spent several intense days managing the fallout. How can a company let a CEO be themselves and convey authenticity without a script while safely representing the corporate brand without undue reputational risk? There’s no doubt that authenticity has value—genuine, unfiltered communication can build trust with both internal and external audiences. Live videos, spontaneous interviews and off-the-cuff Q&As often resonate more than polished scripts. But these moments also carry serious risks. A casual, poorly worded remark can easily veer off-message, triggering internal frustration among employees or, worse, sparking public backlash. Anything from political opinion to comments about layoffs, the workforce and much more are at risk of being misinterpreted. So, how should the internal communications team or external advisers to the corporation manage these new risks? First, media training needs to go beyond traditional TV or print media. It now needs to cover the right tone and body language for TikTok or Instagram, LinkedIn etiquette and dealing with live comments from customers or employees in an open forum environment. Before CEOs go out into the world to communicate, there needs to be some deep thinking about content strategy. It needs to balance personal branding for the individual with corporate messaging. Don’t forget to plan for different scenarios. Comms teams, particularly those supporting high-profile business leaders, should have a multistep plan that follows the possibility of their CEO’s comment or post going viral for the wrong reason. Finally, PRs have been practicing the art of rapid rebuttal in the media for decades. In today’s environment, speed for response across all content verticals is just as critical. Prepare well and be ready to step in should things go south. The great paradox of the modern CEO as the corporate brand is that it stems from a desire to be relatable to many more people than were traditionally reached by the words and actions of company executives. However, by striving to be relatable through greater public exposure, business leaders increase their risk of doing or saying the wrong thing. If that happens, they end up being anything but the person that someone would love to have a beer with. While high-profile gaffes often dominate headlines, a CEO’s internal reputation can be just as critical. When the CEO embodies the company’s identity, their mistakes don’t just damage the brand externally—they can also shake confidence within the organization. Misjudged statements—especially during sensitive moments like layoffs or changes to DEI or remote work policies—can spark anything from employee backlash to public criticism. As a result, communications teams must now monitor internal sentiment as closely as they do media, customer and investor reactions. The challenge for those managing a CEO brand in 2025 is to balance risk and reward. The leader’s voice can be a very powerful tool, but it requires careful management, strategy and real-time monitoring. In an age where saying the wrong thing can spark a consumer boycott or an employee walkout, the CEO doesn’t just speak for the company—they often are the company. Forbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify?

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File photo Uber Technologies missed quarterly revenue estimates as growth in its ride-hailing unit slowed to its weakest since the pandemic, stirring fears of slowing demand against the backdrop of a murky economic outlook and clouding an upbeat forecast. Shares of the company fell about 8 per cent before clawing back some ground to be down 5 per cent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Total revenue rose 14 per cent to $11.53 billion in the first quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $11.62 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Uber has struggled to match the high growth from the post-pandemic quarters and is also contending with lower ride prices with some customers seeking cheaper transport options.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money

Time Published: 2025-05-07T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money

It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut.
