Economic uncertainty lingers at the edge of markets, but it hasn't done much to dent the wild enthusiasm for AI in 2025. The frenzy is still mainly seen in the market's biggest stocks. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 40% in six months, compared to a gain of 20% for the S&P 500 in that time. However, the rally is broadening, and other winners are emerging as the AI buildout accelerates. Analysts at Futurum Group, a market research and intelligence firm, flagged a list of stocks they see as most likely to outperform the most popular names in the next chapter of the AI boom. Here are five tech stocks it sees as the big winners as the rally extends beyond the Magnificent Seven. Ticker: AVGO Year-to-date gain: 43% Analyst's view: Futurum analysts describe Broadcom as the "Uncle Sam of AI," due to its ability to tax many aspects of AI inference, earning it the No. 1 spot on its ranking. "In a world where every AI token costs someone money, Broadcom isn't just supplying parts, but they are becoming the toll collector across silicon, networking, and software, taking a cut from every layer of the stack." Ticker: PLTR Year-to-date gain: 137% Analyst's view: While Palantir stock has stumbled in recent weeks, leading to a spike in bearish sentiment, Futurum's analysts aren't worried. "Palantir has emerged as the execution layer of AI, not selling models or dashboards but decision engines that fuse data, policy, and action across government, defense, and enterprise." Ticker: ORCL Year-to-date gain: 70% Analyst's view: One of the season's breakout tech stocks, Oracle has been in focus since a bullish revenue forecast sent shares surging. Futurum sees it as the core player in the industry, praising its strength as a fundamental enterprise AI provider. "Where others rent compute, Oracle ties it to data by being that structural edge as AI moves from prototype to production," the report said. "That edge is now scaled by numbers that rival hyperscalers." Ticker: NBIS Year-to-date gain: 295% Analyst's view: An unknown AI utility company until recently, Nebius stock surged on September 9 on news that it had inked a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, and Futurum sees the Netherlands-based company playing a pivotal role in the AI economy. "Nebius isn't competing with hyperscalers on breadth. It's competing on the physical and economic constraints that define AI compute: power, cooling, and integration." Ticker: MBD Year-to-date gain: 31% Analyst's view: Over the past two quarters, MongoDB stock has surged as Atlas, its enterprise platform, has helped drive significant revenue growth. Futurum highlighted the platform's ability to help large-scale companies simplify AI applications. "That evolution is why Mongo is winning critical workloads and why it's becoming the memory layer of AI, the bridge between messy enterprise data and agentic systems that require structured retrieval."

This is Naked Capitalism fundraising week. 401 donors have already invested in our efforts to combat corruption and predatory conduct, particularly in the financial realm. Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal, Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our new Coffee Break/Sunday Movie features The western powers seem to be making competing desperate bids to maintain narrative control, and it is very hard to parse the difference between deliberate deception, delusion, and what is just plain dipshittery. I’ll talk about Europe and the Trump’s administration’s efforts in future posts, but this post will look at Israel’s efforts on what Alistair Crooke calls their “8th front:” their battle to control the narrative in the United States. Crooke also insists they are losing in that battle. The Times of Israel agrees. Also a note re the sourcing and quotes in this post. The narrative is being contested online. It’s been my practice to use X.com (formerly Twitter) and YouTube to monitor other social media such as Instagram, TikTok, Telegram, Twitch, etc. Much of this story is being contested on Twitter so this post features a higher than usual % of Twitter embeds, apologies if that’s inconvenient for you. If you’d like me to quote from the tweets separately please let me know in the comments. I’m also embedding tweets from a variety of sources, embeds are not endorsements. Some of these accounts are anonymous and none of them (or any source) should ever be trusted implicitly, nor are they necessarily “allies” of this community (if there is such a thing). I’ve tried to select relevant sources and well-documented posts that advance the story I’m trying to tell. Israel’s desperate push to maintain narrative control in the U.S. Many are, including the President of Iran, anticipating a renewed Israeli attack on Iran and support for Israel plummeting in the U.S., especially among Democrats and young people, including young Republicans. Understandably, these two factors have Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu ramping up his efforts to control the narrative in America. Tucker Carlson went on Glenn Greenwald’s Rumble channel and claimed that Netanyahu is “going around the Middle East” and bragging that he controls the U.S. and Donald Trump. This is not the behavior of a secure player, confident in his powers. This is the voice of dangerous desperation, delusion and maybe some dipshittery too. JUST IN: Tucker Carlson says he knows for 100% FACT that Netanyahu is telling people in the Middle East: “I CONTROL the United States, and I CONTROL Donald Trump” pic.twitter.com/VIBhir6XTE — Sulaiman Ahmed (@ShaykhSulaiman_) September 25, 2025 Bibi’s has also been meeting with influencers and bragging openly about Israel’s control of TikTok (via the Oracle acquisition) and X.com. I’ll quote the Aaron Mate tweet that he used to introduce the below: “Liberals and many progressives spent years fixated on mythical Russian oligarchs controlling US democracy and equally mythical “Russian interference” flooding our information system. “All along, the actual foreign interference was right in front of their dupe faces:” Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu briefed American influencers on TikTok, calling it the “most important” weapon in securing support for Israel on the right-wing. He went on to say, “Weapons change over time… the most important ones are the social media,” and, “the most important… pic.twitter.com/0gfX9Hikzj — AF Post (@AFpost) September 27, 2025 Influencer Dipshittery While not as important as the TikTok deal, Netanyahu has also embarked on an “influencer-heavy” approach to influencing young American public opinion. Not only do social media influences reach a multiple of Americans under 35 than that reached by the MSM, influencers are also often ignorant of politics and sometimes utterly amoral and therefore happy to sign up to support genocide. Bibi recently hosted a number of American influencers. The Prime Minister of Israel official X account tweeted Bibi’s trophy shots from the meeting: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met, after his UN General Assembly speech, with pro-Israel influencers and spoke with them about the challenges in the new era, and the public diplomacy efforts and the influence of the social networks on the discourse for and against Israel. pic.twitter.com/SX397fx7hn — Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) September 28, 2025 Naturally online critics of Israel were quick to document which influencers Bibi got to, here’s one effort by a right-wing X user (the thread on X includes later additions): REVEALED: Netanyahu's Private Meeting of Influencers at the israeli Embassy to help "take over Tiktok and Twitter" ▪️Yair Netanyahu▪️Emily Austin ▪️Debra Lea Schwartzben ▪️judeanceo: Shay Szabo▪️Lizzy Savetsky▪️ThatZionistGirl: _thatopinionatedgirl_ (name unknown)… pic.twitter.com/pWOznACDpn — Sam Parker 🇺🇸🧯 (@BasedSamParker) September 27, 2025 Some of these people are real gems: Emily Wilson aka Emily Saves America attended the secret Hamptons influencer summit with Bill Ackman, and was then flown off to Israel for a propaganda tour Before Israel recruited her, she declared support for Alabama re-instituting chattel slavery pic.twitter.com/Q5fGA5UBiR — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 Different Emily but this one got right to work cranking out real cringe on behalf of Bibi, she’s also hooked up with Hollywood agents: Emily Austin is represented by Casey Wasserman, a top pro-Israel fundraiser for the Democratic Party https://t.co/BxSd6L4GhW — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 We’ll have more from Max on Israel’s Hollywood moves further down in the post. But I wanted to share one more seeming fail from another of Bibi’s newly activated influencers, social media is not sending their best: Her followers weren’t having any of it https://t.co/3OaD3VtgEw pic.twitter.com/5FKOpI9i2B — Mel (@Villgecrazylady) September 28, 2025 There’s also the very important matter of getting the right person in the Turning Point USA frontman role once filled by Charlie Kirk. Let’s not forget that Netanyahu was one of the first to post about the death of Kirk, with a very polished tweet, written on a day when Israel was engaged in military attacks on seven neighbors. Charlie Kirk was murdered for speaking truth and defending freedom. A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization. I spoke to him only two weeks ago and invited him to Israel. Sadly, that visit will not take place.We lost an… — Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) September 10, 2025 He’s since gone on to deny that Israel had any role in Kirk’s death: Charlie Kirk was a great man. He deserves honor – not lies. pic.twitter.com/NwEN4B2q7w — Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) September 18, 2025 The massively popular libertarian comic Tim Dillon discussed Bibi’s denials with Max Blumenthal: Tim Dillon: "Can you remember any time in the history of a political assassination the leader of a foreign government has come out to deny that they were behind it?" Max Blumenthal: "No. And I've never seen anything like what Netanyahu was doing after a tragedy…since 9/11." pic.twitter.com/fgdKyyldIt — James Li (@5149jamesli) September 14, 2025 Ben Shapiro is running the show at TPUSA. He was quick to announce it, in terms of “picking up the blood-stained mic”, posting on September 11, the day after Kirk’s death. A post shared by Ben Shapiro (@officialbenshapiro) He’s been accused of buying that controlling role at the organization, a move that was sewed up by September 15. Ben Shapiro’s donation of $1M is why they kiIIed Charlie. Now TPUSA remains Zionist. Charlie was AGAINST war with Iran. Ben supports it. You can bet TPUSA will now push for a war with Iran. Ben is a Mossad parasite. This is a hostile takeover. pic.twitter.com/Dm2HntzGtZ — ADAM (@AdameMedia) September 17, 2025 Given that Shapiro’s Daily Wire has allegedly been declining in viewership (Google trends) since he lost Candace Owens over her opposition to Gaza, but he needs a fresh gentile face to be a credible frontman for the young MAGA crowd: It is abundantly clear that the RNC is enforcing a controlled Charlie Kirk on Turning Point USA.

He reeks of the cultural tropes of the Old South aristocracy (ie the slave lords), a caste that has wealth and power but hasn’t had significant cultural influence in the U.S. since the Civil War: The Left’s silence during the protests at Columbia and Yale has made their stance perfectly clear: Democrats are Anti-Israel and pro "Death to America" chants. Republicans proudly stand with Israel and condem this hateful rhetoric. pic.twitter.com/DUxBtk2yj1 — Brilyn Hollyhand (@BrilynHollyhand) April 30, 2024 At the University of Texas we’d describe someone like Hollyhand as “putting off strong Kappa Alpha, Birmingham chapter, vibes.” UPDATE: Hollyhand might be overstating his relationship with TPSUA. Hollywood Hasbara And it’s not just influencers, there is plenty of work to be done on the MSM side and Israel has been busy there, too. Max Blumenthal tweeted a list of “Hollywood hasbara”: The Hollywood hasbara is coming hard and fast as Israel loses control of the narrative A Paramount propaganda series on October 7 A (postponed) AppleTV show glorifying the ADL The new season of AppleTV’s news-focused Morning Show demonizes Iran while ignoring Gaza pic.twitter.com/FYYddwEOGR — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 Paramount is all in, there’s this documentary: pic.twitter.com/o1omvQKu8j — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) September 29, 2025 And a new mini-series on October 7, per The Hollywood Reporter: Paramount+ has released the harrowing first trailer for an upcoming four-part limited series depicting the Oct. 7, 2023 tragedy in Israel. The project is titled Red Alert and it portrays the largest and deadliest massacre in Israel’s history, when more than 1,200 concert-goers, families and individuals near the Gaza border were murdered and 250 were kidnapped by Hamas. The show’s production credits include Pulp Fiction producer Lawrence Bender and Homeland producer Keshet Media Group. Red Alert is “draws from the true experiences of those who survived and weaves their courageous personal stories into a cinematic narrative of the devastating terrorist attack that turned southern Israel into a war zone, testing humanity and forging heroism through chaos.” Kirk’s death has slowed at least one Hollywood hasbara effort, per the New York Times: Apple TV+ has postponed the release of its show “The Savant,” starring Jessica Chastain as an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to stop mass shootings. The show was set to begin streaming its first two episodes on Friday. Apple did not give a reason for its postponement, which it announced on Tuesday, saying in a brief statement only that the decision was made after “careful consideration.” It did not announce a new release date. Two people with knowledge of the discussions said that the company was reluctant to release the show in the current political climate, after the assassination of Charlie Kirk this month. The most important of all: Oracle, Paramount, and TikTok I’ll close with what I opened with, the importance to Netanyahu and Israel of the new TikTok ownership. Israel is currently being blamed for the wave of anti-Chinese propaganda that provided the ostensible reason for last year’s U.S. Congressional vote to ban TikTok unless it changed owners: Did You Know Zionists Were Behind the TikTok CCP Narrative 1) Oct-Dec 2023, TikTok was top app for Israel truth 2) Dec 2023, Zionist tech investor Anthony Goldbloom commissioned NCRI (Israeli funded/managed NGO) to produce a report claiming China’s CCP controls TikTok. After… https://t.co/adlraAQOTA pic.twitter.com/nm41Xm8Wjg — GenXGirl (@GenXGirl1994) September 28, 2025 We also must discuss the role of Larry Ellison, David Ellison and the new Oracle nepo-ownership of Paramount in pulling that off. Wired is quoting “a Trump advisor” who calls Larry Ellison, a “Shadow president”: In an age where human attention is perhaps the world’s most valuable commodity, the Ellisons could be in charge of almost everything a modern-day pseudo robber barron could want by the end of this year or soon after. I spoke with sources who have dealt with Ellison—as well as others who know his son, David—to get a sense of how he operates. And he operates a lot lately… There’s his pending dominance over vertical video with a key role in the proposed new ownership consortium for the US version of TikTok, for which Oracle’s servers already provide hosting. There’s airwave domination, with a news and entertainment behemoth under his son’s control following the merger of David’s Skydance and Paramount—which might possibly include the keys to not only CBS, but also CNN, if Skydance actually puts in a bid and succeeds in a potential acquisition of Warner Brothers-Discovery. The empire spans from the sweaty floor of the octagon after acquiring US broadcast rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (also under Paramount) all the way to the clay soil of Abilene, Texas, home of OpenAI’s Stargate data center project led by Oracle and Softbank. Oracle is also linked to a $100 billion deal with Nvidia and OpenAI announced Monday. The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil. I’ve posted previously about Ellison, Oracle, Paramount, Israel, and the Trump administration. I’ve also previously posted about the role of the Trump administration in pressuring Paramount’s previous owner Shari Redstone to sell to the Ellisons. I’ve also cited the work of The MMA Draw which explained the role of Ellison ally Ari Emanuel in getting Trump to support that move. Emanuel is a top Trump insider, a combat sports multi-monopolist (mixed martial arts, pro wrestling, and moving to take over boxing), Hollywood power broker, and brother of Democratic presidential aspirant Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel is also at the center of a web of financiers that is deeply involved in the new Paramount, per Zach Arnold at The MMA Draw: Ari Emanuel is focused entirely on controlling the politics and the plumbing of media pipes. He has deep ties to ESPN & Netflix. There are still ties with NBCUniversal. And now Paramount is on the table. Since the take-private of Endeavor, Gerry Cardinale of Redbird Capital has emerged as Ari Emanuel’s key financial muscle. Redbird Capital is a principle investor in Skydance, the Larry & David Ellison shop that is taking over Paramount from Shari Redstone. Guess who is now going to be running management in Paramount? Guess who’s going to be on Paramount’s Board of Directors? Andy Gordon, former heavyweight from Goldman Sachs, is now COO and Chief Strategist (Redbird) at Paramount. Justin Hamill, Chief Legal Officer of Silver Lake, is going to be on Paramount’s BOD. Silver Lake and Mubadala are the main financiers behind Endeavor. Heads, Ari wins; tails, you lose. That’s how this works. Mubadala is the UAE’s financial vehicle and Silver Lake (which owns most of WME Group, the parent company of Emanuel’s fight empire TKO) is reportedly to be Oracle’s new partner in the TikTok acquisition: A group of three investors, including Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake, will take a roughly 50% stake in TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the deal said on Thursday. A group of existing shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, will hold a roughly 30% stake, the source said. Among ByteDance’s current investors are Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR. … CNBC reported earlier that Abu Dhabi-based MGX, Oracle and Silver Lake are poised to be the main investors in TikTok U.S. with a combined 45% ownership, citing sources. MGX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the CNBC report. MGX is an artificial intelligence investment firm and a partner of Silver Lake, and falls under the purview of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser and brother of the President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The AI and surveillance delusions of Larry Ellison It’s fairly well established that Israeli PM Netanyahu is delusional on many topics whether it’s Israel’s status as a world power, Israel’s ability to cut off trade with Egypt, or his vision of Israel as a autarkic “Super-Sparta.” I do want to highlight the fundamental desperation that is driving Netanyahu, as Imran Khalid ably described in May: By now, it should surprise no one that Benjamin Netanyahu prefers the echo chamber of his own making to the international chorus demanding accountability. The Israeli prime minister, clinging to office as tenaciously as he clings to delusion, has managed to place himself among the most cynically manipulative leaders of our time, a man who governs not by vision, but by vindictiveness. Once vaunted as a statesman in the mold of Churchill, Netanyahu now more closely resembles a bunker-dwelling autocrat, lashing out at allies and adversaries alike as his credibility collapses under the weight of his own contradictions. … Netanyahu thrives in crisis, not to resolve it but to prolong it, using chaos as a shield against the ever-looming specter of his own political demise. With corruption charges still dogging him and public opinion slipping, he has fashioned Gaza into both a battlefield and a diversion. … He is a leader in free fall, dragging his country with him, increasingly abandoned by allies, and yet still believing himself the indispensable man. The tragedy is not only his. It belongs to Israel—and to all those, Palestinian and Israeli alike, who must live with the consequences of his delusions. But I’d rather focus on some of the delusions and desperation that may be driving Larry Ellison. First, he’s becoming quite well known as one of the leading spokesmen (alongside Palantir’s Alex Karp and Peter Thiel) for a vision of security through surveillance: The man behind the digital ID push is Larry Ellison, owner of Oracle, CBS, CNN, and, soon, TikTok. He wants data centralization and total surveillance. "Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly watching & recording everything that's going on." Terrifying. https://t.co/mb05XvnOAx pic.twitter.com/cUx45ORy2F — Michael Shellenberger (@shellenberger) September 27, 2025 The above may be deception rather than delusion, but if so, Ellison is revealing a great deal about himself to the public and its being widely used against him and his allies (I’ll discuss the backlash to Oracle’s role in the UK’s just announced Digital ID plan in my next post tomorrow morning). As for the desperation, well Oracle is taking out billions of dollars in debt to pay for their AI aspirations, per Yahoo Finance on Sept. 24: Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion US investment-grade bonds on Wednesday, the market’s second-largest deal this year, as the software maker ramps up its spending to meet the needs of the artificial intelligence boom. Demand peaked at nearly $88 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The technology giant — which has nearly doubled in value this year — is issuing debt in six parts, including a rare 40-year bond, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private details. That note will yield 1.37 percentage points above similarly dated Treasuries, compared with initial price talk of about 1.65 percentage points. A floating-rate tranche was dropped during syndication. The debt raise comes as Oracle begins to fulfill massive cloud infrastructure deals with customers like OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc., which are boosting the company’s expenses. Over the next several years, it is projected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rent and power data centers. It is also the cloud provider to TikTok in the US, and under a new framework outlined by the White House earlier this week, it would help oversee the development of a new US-only version of the social media giant’s algorithm. The software company spent years trailing the top three vendors — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — in the competitive cloud infrastructure market. Now that it has struck serious cloud deals, it’s on the hook for upfront costs. Oracle’s cash flow flipped negative this year for the first time since 1992. Analysts anticipate the metric will be in free fall over the coming years before returning to positive in 2029. Oracle and OpenAI announced a $300 billion cloud deal on September 10 (that was truly a historic day) that initially goosed Oracle’s stock price significantly. The Wall Street Journal had the scoop: OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years, people familiar with the matter said, a massive commitment that far outstrips the startup’s current revenue. The deal is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, reflecting how spending on AI data centers is hitting new highs despite mounting concerns over a potential bubble. The Oracle contract will require 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, roughly comparable to the electricity produced by more than two Hoover Dams or the amount consumed by about four million homes. Oracle shares surged by as much as 43% on Wednesday after the cloud company revealed it added $317 billion in future contract revenue during its latest quarter that ended in Aug. 31. Chief Executive Safra Catz told analysts that it had signed contracts with three different customers during the quarter. The share price surge increased Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison’s wealth by more than $100 billion, pushing him into the range of Elon Musk as the world’s richest person, with a net worth of almost $400 billion. The OpenAI and Oracle contract, which starts in 2027, is a risky gamble for both companies. OpenAI is a money-losing startup that disclosed in June it was generating roughly $10 billion in annual revenue—less than one-fifth of the $60 billion it will have to pay on average every year. Oracle is concentrating a large chunk of its future revenue on one customer—and will likely have to take on debt to buy the AI chips needed to power the data centers. Ed Zitron ripped the deal, calling it “full of crap”: Analysts fawned over Oracle — again, as it missed estimates — with TD Cowen’s Derrick Wood saying it was a “momentous quarter” (again, it missed) and that these numbers were “really amazing to see,” and Guggenheim Securities’ John DiFucci said he was “blown away.” Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick added that “[analysts] were all kind of in shock, in a very good way.” RPOs, while standard (and required) accounting practice and based on actual signed contracts, are being used by Oracle as a form of marketing. Plans change, contracts can be canceled (usually with a kill fee, but nevertheless), and, especially in this case, clients can either not have the money to pay or die for the very same reason they can’t pay. In Oracle’s case, it isn’t simply promising ridiculous growth, it is effectively saying it’ll become the dominant player in all cloud compute. Oracle claims that it will make $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in FY2026, $32 billion in FY2027, $73 billion in FY2028, $114 billion in FY2029, and $144 billion in FY2030. While all of this isn’t necessarily OpenAI (as it adds up to $381 billion), it’s fair to assume that the majority of it is. This means — as the $300 billion of the $317 billion of new contracts added by Oracle, and assuming OpenAI makes up 78% of its cloud infrastructure revenue ($300 billion out of $381 billion) — that OpenAI intends to spend over $88 billion fucking dollars in compute by FY2029, and $110 billion dollars in compute, AKA nearly as much as Amazon Web Services makes in a year, in FY2030. Now that stock price froth is beginning to fade with a 16% drop in Oracle’s share price last week, per Technobezz: Sometimes the market’s most beloved darlings get hit the hardest when reality comes knocking. Oracle just learned this lesson the hard way, watching its stock price plummet 16% from recent highs as analysts started asking uncomfortable questions about those sky-high AI promises. The damage started this week when Rothschild & Redburn analyst Alex Haissl dropped a bombshell coverage initiation, slapping Oracle with a rare “Sell” rating and a $175 price target. That’s not just pessimistic – it’s predicting roughly 40% downside from current levels. According to The Motley Fool, shares that were trading above $308 just days ago have already tumbled to around $291, and according to multiple analyst reports, this might just be the beginning. Here’s what’s got Wall Street spooked: Oracle has floated aggressive targets for cloud growth, with executives outlining a path for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to reach about $18 billion this fiscal year and scale toward $144 billion by fiscal 2030. That’s ambitious against the company’s most recent quarter showing total revenue of $15.9 billion and cloud services and license support of $11.7 billion. The numbers tell a more nuanced story than Oracle’s executives might prefer. While the company did post respectable 11% revenue growth in Q4, with cloud services jumping 14% to $11.7 billion, the valuation has gotten completely divorced from fundamentals. According to Seeking Alpha analysts, Oracle now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 41-46 – compare that to the industry median of 29, or even Nvidia’s 50 (despite Nvidia’s 50%+ revenue growth rate). That disconnect becomes even more stark when you consider the broader context. A recent MIT study found that 95% of companies investing in generative AI have yet to see any financial returns. Yet Oracle’s stock had been riding high on promises of triple-digit growth in its multicloud revenue, with CEO Larry Ellison boasting about building 47 new data centers in the next 12 months. The confluence of the AI bubble, the rot economy, what I’ve called “The Interregnum of Unreality” with Israel’s desperate, deceptive, delusional attempts to control the American political system shows how the polycrisis impacts everyone. I’d like to justify my focus on Larry Ellison’s role in this process by referencing an insight from a DropSite News writer Waqas on X who was discussing the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Israel, but I think it’s apropos for Ellison as well: Epstein himself was a supranational entity floating above it all with access to networks and finance that is impossible to put together by a single individual. If you consider Israel a proper country and a nation, you would fall into the trap of thinking that Epstein worked for Mossad, working for the interests of Israel. But consider this for a second and redo your calculations just to see if it makes sense: Israel is not a regular country, it is an entity that exists to provide sovereign cover to a network of billionaires and allows them a financial and regulatory home base that can circumvent international laws and local laws in other countries. Even ordinary Israeli citizens are victims of and are being used by this entity. In this system, Epstein is a part of a network that all these people named in the emails are also a part of. They make international deals on behalf of each other and share resources. Israel is a sub structure that allows all this. Mossad then is just an intelligence arm of this loose confederation of billionaires. I’ll continue this mini-series tomorrow morning with a look at the delusion, deception and dipshittery involved with the information war being fought by the EU, the UK, and Ukraine to control the European population and keep the US deeply involved on their increasingly irrelevant subcontinent. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Anecdata to your last point, Nat: a good decade ago my silly sister invested in a scam spun out of illegal sports betting websites on Cyprus that evolved into stock price-calling on a daily-weekly-whatever basis, where you guess if a price would go up or down, period, called binary options trading. This industry became somewhat regulated on Cyprus, so it moved to Israel, where its practices were spread around the world by immigrants who spoke no Hebrew, but knew how to sell bubbles and BS back home. Tel Aviv was the capital of this industry, and its only regulation was that it was illegal for salesmen to sell to Israelis. That’s it. As long as the calls were international, no regs. It’s a cute, minor example of the service system DropSite describes. I guess it’s true, it sure worked on my sister (who’d dragged me in too because I wanted to show my love . . .) Yes, we lost everything, then our salesman ‘died.’ I’d like to think that judging by their crappy accounting software, Oracle won’t be a dominant player in anything. But that software enjoys a 5-10% market share in its industry and I know of at least one company that gladly overpaid millions of dollars to install it. Are Tiktok watchers savvier than CEOs and will they know crap when they see it, and tune out? A guy can dream. On a somewhat positive note, now that Ellison has swallowed up CNN, it might be a little easier to convince a few holdouts I know that CNN is in fact a propaganda network, and not a middle of the road independent news source. Obviously not shown in any of these (esp not propaganda flicks/stuff coming out of Hollywood thst is): IDF gunships massacring more Jews than ever around 10/7 since SS was still active… I’m not trying to be negative, but does this seem like a very weird and out-of-character piece for NC? Maybe it’s just me. Sorry you feel that way. It was an attempt to build on my piece on the online aftermath of the Charlie Kirk killing: Doomscrolling the Influencer Apocalypse which was quite well received by the commenters and my colleagues here. How many are noticing and decrying the whole narrative thing? Wasn’t bad enough with US media cheerleading lying BS nonsense? Now international clapp-trap apps by more wannabe self-promoting Platonic Manipulation Class best and brightest to tell us paroles, plebes and unwashed what to think. Any wonder about disillusionment, and desire for change? Eff’em all, and the narratives they rode in on. Say, Waaaa? A worthy addition to NC Keep up the fine work, Nat: this long-time NC-er appreciates it muchly. Reporting of this quality, with background and deeper context for news worthy events of the day, served with links to evidence of skulduggery in plain sight and further links to other useful reporting…. Although does Ben Shapiro have a millions bucks of his own money with no string attached? It should be presumed Ben would be acting as a bagman for various billionaires This is a “yellow waders” (nee Lambert) style write up … and I love it. Perhaps the only difference is the emphasis of content from X, which Nat did call out. People who’ve been paying attention should understand that what’s playing out online is a major reason for concern among the consent manufacturers. Wake up. Less and less people are glued to boob tube … Exhibit A: MSNBC, CNN & Fox News Ratings: Dramatic Drops & Most-Watched Shows (via TVInsider) Excerpts (key 25 – 54 demographic #’s): • Fox News was down 30% in total viewers and 48% in the key demo • MSNBC down 26% and in the [key] demo, down 37% • CNN down 29% and in the key [demo] down 44% Online is where the (increasingly anti-war, pro-Palestine) discourse is getting amplified. This is why TikTok was made to surrender to American (and by extension Ni0n1sT) control. This is probably why EA just went private. Young people are abandoning support for Israel and this is a threat to the horrid, inhumane, warmongering status quo. Yes, it feels like a clear spiritual successor to those for me: here is a thing that I don’t understand/isn’t receiving sufficient coverage/is at odds with what’s being reported in the media/etc., here’s my attempt to dig into it and figure it out, commenter input/participation welcome. In this case it’s the rabbit hole of social media influencers and how they shape narratives around current events, which I freely admit is something I understand not at all, so I welcome the attempt. There’s definitely something pathological out there, probably multiple somethings, and I think some diagnostic efforts are warranted. (I guess the Chris faction is in support based on a sample of 2) Thank you dear Chris Of The Pacific … Now we wait for the other five or six Chris’s to complete the sample size … 😂 I think this piece is great, and fits totally with NC. It covers geopolitics, economics and the attention economy/firehose of social media. It also goes it together in a very important way – the Ellisons, the Hobbit-botherers, real misinformation, and the surveillance state. This is a hugely important and new confluence of power and I for one think it’s something we should be focusing on. As Chris says above, Yellow Waders stuff :) I am reminded of what the great western sheriff and journalist Bat Masterson said, ” Everybody gets plenty of ice. The difference is that the Rich get it in the summertime, and the Poor get it in the winter.” This was, among other things, a description post on a part of the influencer world. Go back and do a scroll watching all those selfies, most of them trying to look happy and sure, and a few serious and sure. Truth in a selfie is what the influencers sell. It is precisely each of those selfies, secure, happy, full-screen faces the main and only source for trust in each influencer and whatever they say. IMO, this show is, by itself, interesting. Then go and check cui bono in the same post. I really have no idea on how influencing are these influencers but this is a relatively new and weird way to push and invest on whatever campaign. For me, this is the very first example of a “geostrategic influencer campaign”. The dots are getting closer, not much skill needed to connect them anymore. Ellison and the rest of the Zio-garchy fidn to be trillionaires soon, as all the wealth and resources are asset-stripped and sucked up by the Giant Vampire Squid. (to bring back the metaphor). As the electromagnetic spectrum is increasingly monopolized, the more they can completely dictate most public discourse. And the cycle continues…. but on the bright side, it seems like more and more are starting to question, as the lies get more and more irrational and transparent. (I’m trying to be optimistic for a change) Thanks to places like NC, we can read and discuss matters that are outside of the Unified Hegemonic Narrative, which is becoming more and more difficult. George Galloway was detained and harassed by armed police at Gatwick Airport recently. His personal electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for hours. And dude was an MP for decades, and is now a media personality as well. BTW, Alastair Crooke is spelled with an “e” at the end. Long LIve Naked Capitalism! Thanks very much, and I fixed the spelling of Crooke, d’oh! Silver Lake + the Saudis + Jared Kushner announced today that they are buying Electronic Arts, the world’s largest (not connected to a platform) video game publisher. Ah I was tempted to fit that in. That’s a deal that really makes explicit the alliance between the Zionist money and the Gulf State Arabs. Abraham Accords may be dead but long live the Abraham Accords, amirite? W.T.A.F. There’s been a recent groundswell about banning Israel from international sports … I am wondering how this plays into it. They are determined to have some method of tapping into youth to keep spreading #N1Oni5T propaganda and lies … Ugh I do fear that this will culminate in a real wide spread antisemitism as I think theres plenty to show that there for many, there is little distinction between a Zionist and a Jew (buffered by how Israel wraps itself in the Jewish idenity) What’s worse, these psychos are more than happy with it because it then supports their position that the only safe place for Jewish people is Israel. This is becoming far more grim than I could have ever imagined. Last time you posted “Doomscrolling … “, I promised to return to comment in depth, but never did … #Boo But today … I avenge my master! LOL (via screenrant.com) #NarrativeControl I always fondly recall how MSM heads exploded after Bernie won Nevada in 2020 Dem Primary. That was a good example of what happens when establishment consent manufacturing doesn’t work. The stakes are much higher here, however, hence the incredibly desperate moves. But you can tell it’s a bunch old old heads (Boooooooomeeeeerrrs) running the show. What makes them think that the kids making tik-toks about #th3G4z@g3N0c1d3 won’t move elsewhere to some other platform if there is some kind of clamp down? Remember all the Americans who rushed to RedNote earlier this year (via Reuters)? What would the US do to stop that? The only forcing function for obedience is the fact that a lot of creators make good $ on TikTok. Not sure how many of those posting radical dissent need to stay on that gravy train. … which is a perfect segue to Influencer Dipshittery. #InfluencerDipshittery > … influencers are also often ignorant of politics and sometimes utterly amoral and therefore happy to sign up to support genocide Pretty much. Thanks for the tweets. They often serve as portals, not ends in and of themselves. One need only follow them via the comments and replies to realize again that this is not a one way street. Those hoping to keep g3n0C16e alive are seriously underestimating the severity of the schisms on both sides of the political divide, and the degree of clapback incoming. I was curious to follow up on one Destiny Albritton – it’s always somewhat bizarre to see African American or other people in the African diaspora caping for Ni0n15ts. What on earth are they thinking? Her last repost is of another African American influencer, Xaviaer DuRousseau, posting a seven-point-litany of excuses talking points regarding the now confirmed and infamous Hamptons influencer gathering hosted by Bill Ackman. One can almost feel the beads of perspiration on this brother’s forehead … LOL • He repeats the talking point Netenyahu tried to sell the world in the first tweet after the shooting – that Charlie was a friend of Israel. That’s not untrue, but why is everyone keen to say it if it were not in question? • He tries to explain away being nervy when approached by Max Blumenthal – I was drunk. I never heard of you or your site. See Nat’s quote above re: ignorant. • He claims Charlie designed the event, and one of the topics covered was right-wing infighting … funny that. When I followed the rabbit hole to DuRousseau’s X profile, I saw plenty evidence of that: beefing with Tim Pool? Check! Getting called out by mostly right-wing accounts for shilling for Bibi? Check! So you see, their dipshittery is getting a fair amount of blowback, and that’s the main thing I take away: that we’re seeing a schism in real time, and I don’t think that genie is getting shoved back in the bottle. And buying TikTok or hiring a bunch of amoral influencers to sh**post Bibi’s way out of his murderous overreach is not going to work. #HollywoodHasbara I’ve always felt that there was a certain fearlessness or perhaps, audacity is a better term, when it comes to Hollywood feeling free to push establishment and anti-establishment narratives. October 7th documentaries are all well and good, but remember, you’re dealing with a generation that’s been fed movies like the entire Bourne series, in which the US Spook estate is the villain. See also one of my favorite rogue agent movies, “Shooter” (via IMDb), which stars Marky Mark Wahlberg as a putative assassination patsy who refuses to die and goes on to turn an FBI agent into his kill-em-all-let-deity-decide ally, and basically kills everyone in the sick deep state chain of command who conspired to end his life. Can’t lie, that movie was the first thing on my mind when the whole Tyler Robinson narrative began to unfold. And I’m sure other people who have feasted on the exploits of Jason Bourne and Bob Lee Swagger felt the same – even about Trump’s would be rally assassin in PA. I don’t know how the architects of this plan expect things to turn out. Hollywood isn’t the only show in town. I can’t wait for rebel film makers to start getting financing from China … LOL I can only assume that we’re headed to a point where the US is also going to have a “Great Firewall”, blocking content from the non-US-based platforms to which USians will flock when they abandon PalantirTok en masse. Get your VPNs ready! #MediaTechAISurveillanceAlliance So to echo dear Ben’s (jinx!) comment below, how does #OraParaPalantirTok think it’s going to put the genie back in the bottle? Are we on our way to people being arrested for posting pics of unalived Gazan families? Surveillance for the purpose of what exactly? Kicking kids out of college? More deportations? I agree with Ben here as well: too many people have seen outside their silo. And a lot of those people don’t necessarily inhabit the same political circles. I have had cause to visit Candace Owen’s YT tube page more times in the last month then for the entirety of my existence before Kirk’s death. And it’s not just what she’s saying, I also look at what the comments under her videos are saying. and some of those comments are eye-opening. Her last video was posted five hours ago (as of 1030PM US EDT), and has over 1.2M views already. People are questioning everything: • Why no autopsy? • Why is his wife acting as if nothing’s happened? • His weird security detail … their actions before and after In short, the stench is too strong … anyone who thinks 10/7 documentaries are gonna guilt people into letting go of pro-Palestinian sentiments this deep into this horrible Netanyahu campaign against Gaza, is as Nat asserts delusional. And what does it mean that we’ve reached the delusion phase of oligarchy? To borrow a phrase from Lambert, the deluded are very much akin to those who were clueless in Versailles. Thanks again, Nat, for this awesome post and the legwork it took to bring it to us. You can’t unsee dead kids. I think it’s that simple. If only it were that simple for some … (via YouTube) ChrisRUEcon: Thanks for the series of observations, which together are a diagnosis. And there is this that you wrote in regard to influencer (whoever they are ???) dipshittery: “Thanks for the tweets. They often serve as portals, not ends in and of themselves. One need only follow them via the comments and replies to realize again that this is not a one way street.” Yep. I don’t comment at YTube — the comments are a swamp. But they are a way of taking the temperature of USanians. I’d say that the U.S. two-party system is a flaking façade, papered with money, trying to keep the splits under its control. The Democrats are split beyond repair, with the Dem liberals desperately trying to control the Dem levellers, and the Republicans are split along MAGA paleoconservative, MAGA authoritarian, Calvinist cargo cult, and a group that advocates a kind of levelling. Equality in the U S of A is going to require levelling. Charlie Kirk was not up to the job, nor is Pete Buttigieg. The problem with portals into US-dominated comments sections at places like YTube is that you have many people who think expressing an opinion, of any kind, is some sort of political act. See FcBook and its swamp of memes. An opinion is an opinion is an opinion. The U.S. political arena (or “marketplace of ideas” to use a typical Anglosphere cliché) hasn’t approached dialectic. What is to be done? Hasbara not working? Even with TikTok, I’m not sure this genie goes back in the bottle. Too many people have seen outside their silo. Americans’ Support for Israel Dramatically Declines, Times/Siena Poll Finds (NYT article) Raw data (NYT) In the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, American voters broadly sympathized with Israelis over Palestinians, with 47 percent siding with Israel and 20 percent with Palestinians. In the new poll, 34 percent said they sided with Israel and 35 percent with Palestinians. Thirty-one percent said they were unsure or backed both equally. A majority of American voters now oppose sending additional economic and military aid to Israel, a stunning reversal in public opinion since the Oct. 7 attacks. About six out of 10 voters said that Israel should end its military campaign, even if the remaining Israeli hostages were not released or Hamas was not eliminated. And 40 percent of voters said Israel was intentionally killing civilians in Gaza, nearly double the number of voters who agreed with that statement in the 2023 poll. Younger voters, regardless of party, were less likely to back continuing that support. Nearly seven in 10 voters under 30 said they opposed additional economic or military aid. Much of the shift in views on Israel has been driven by a sharp decline in support by Democratic voters. Republicans largely continue to support Israel, though there has been a modest decline…. …Yet even Republican support has fallen, albeit by significantly less. Republicans still sympathize with Israel more than Palestinians, 64 percent to 9 percent. But those numbers indicate a drop in support of 12 percentage points since 2023, when 76 percent sided with Israel. About a third of Republicans said Israel’s military was not taking enough action to prevent civilian deaths. > I’m not sure this genie goes back in the bottle Ha! Jinx! And I’m not even a Chris :) Fantastic work Nat! And it helps to have the links to your earlier pieces plus the additional on-line stuff for review as you piece together this grotesque crazy quilt. Historically it’s probably always been something like this but it is really something being able to see so many uber wealthy coming up from the depths to strut their stuff and make their moves. Yes, agreed. Nate is doing Lambert level work and is much appreciated. Larry Ellison has the proverbial face that needs punching. speaking of “the proverbial face that needs punching”, once upon a time in a prior life, i worked in the same redwood shores tower that that slimy now-billionaire had his offices. dreaded taking the lifts due to the chance of meeting him therein. legends said he fired people for being in the lift with him. being h1b, the risk was great. that entire corpse was made in his image, btw … Great post, Nat. I am really enjoying your contributions to NC! Regarding your final point: I think this theory is mostly accurate. I think Israel may be the only country that offers a path to citizenship purely through religious affiliation, and (at least until the Kahanists/State of Judea types solidify their grip on long term power) it doesn’t actually require real religious dogma if the halacha rule of a Jewish mother and the associated birth and congregation records are available. Combined with several other aspects (Israel’s extradition policy, the extremely dense startup/financier community, the extreme overlap between civilian/military/intelligence communities due to mass conscription) it would not surprise me to find out there is not just one ‘big group’ but many groups that leverage their relationships to the state and the supra- and trans-national state organizations to profit in various ways. Regarding Ellison explicitly this tidbit may be of interest in terms of ‘why TikTok, why now’: A close friend of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ellison has been named as a potential witness in the trial against the Likud leader as part of Case 2000, the alleged bribery affair involving Yediot Ahronot. Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lania, which he purchased in 2012 for some $300 million. Among his contributions to Israeli causes are more than $26 million given to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, as well as $500,000 to fortify a community center in Sderot in 2007. From this hagiographic fluff piece from 2021. <"Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lania" Or Lānaʻi as we call it here, though commonly written Lanai as, let's face it, using diacritics isn't a USian thing. But other than refurbing the two resorts on the island, can't see that Ellison has had any impact whatsoever here. Or if he has it doesn't get any reporting. Living in Greece but was back in Northern California for a wedding this summer. Lived there till 2021. Just anecdata but an acquaintance, staunch right wing Trump supporter, very Christian was appalled at what was happening in Gaza. I remember him being a Ben Shapiro stan back in the day also. When you’ve lost someone like him then I think the percentages of Israel support among the republicans, esp the America first crowd, may be even lower than the polls capture. To add, back in 2021 the area (Yuba City/Marysville and surrounding countryside) was chock fulla Trump signs and American flags. I didn’t see one sign this time around. Think the rural population feels duped, esp as cheap farm labor gets rounded up. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: A look at today's billionaires a century after Rockefeller became the first

Watch CBS News Updated on: September 29, 2025 / 12:44 PM EDT / CBS News On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire. More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth — approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel. Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today. There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing. Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 — up from 813 in 2024. Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports. And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 — about 15% more than its 2023 estimate. Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates. Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set. His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29. Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, "The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people." Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024. In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth "could be turned into cash and distributed equally—which it couldn't—[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each." Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person. Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over. Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades — toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age. The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data. "What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses," said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas. But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri. By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth — up over 10 percentage points from 1980. Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country — or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023. The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023. Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways. The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men — about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes — and most make rather than inherit their wealth. Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of "A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era." "He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks," Nichols said. "But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time." Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data. Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather. Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.

Title: SEC Intends to Allow Dimensional to Offer Dual Share Class Funds

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class.

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse.

September 29, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoRL -- NVIDIA today announced that the open‑source Newton Physics Engine is now available in NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab, along with the open NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.6 reasoning vision language action model for robot skills and new AI infrastructure. Together, these technologies provide developers and researchers with an open, accelerated robotics platform that speeds iteration, standardizes testing, unifies training with on‑robot inference and helps robots transfer skills safely and reliably from simulation to the real world. “Humanoids are the next frontier of physical AI, requiring the ability to reason, adapt and act safely in an unpredictable world,” said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. “With these latest updates, developers now have the three computers to bring robots from research into everyday life — with Isaac GR00T serving as robot’s brains, Newton simulating their body and NVIDIA Omniverse as their training ground.” Newton Opens New Standard for Physical Simulation in RoboticsRobots learn faster and safer in simulation, but humanoid robots — with their complex joints, balance and movements — push today’s physics engines to the limit. Over a quarter-million robotics developers worldwide need accurate physics, so the skills they teach robots in simulation can be executed safely and reliably in the real world. Today, NVIDIA announced the beta release of Newton, an open-source, GPU-accelerated physics engine, managed by the Linux Foundation. Built on the NVIDIA Warp and OpenUSD frameworks, and codeveloped by Google DeepMind, Disney Research and NVIDIA, Newton is available now. With Newton’s flexible design and ability to work with different types of physics solvers, developers can now simulate extremely complex robot actions, like walking through snow or gravel and handling cups and fruits, and successfully deploy them in the real world. The latest adopters of Newton are esteemed research labs and universities such as ETH Zurich Robotic Systems Lab, Technical University of Munich and Peking University, robotics company Lightwheel, and simulation engine company Style3D. Cosmos Reason Improves Robot Reasoning for New Open Isaac GR00T N1.6 ModelTo perform humanlike tasks in the physical world, humanoids must understand ambiguous instructions and deal with the long tail of never-before-seen experiences. The latest release of the open Isaac GR00T N1.6 robot foundation model, available soon on Hugging Face, will integrate NVIDIA Cosmos™ Reason, an open, customizable reasoning vision language model built for physical AI. Acting as the robot’s deep-thinking brain, Cosmos Reason turns vague instructions into step-by-step plans, using prior knowledge, common sense and physics to handle new situations and generalize across many tasks. Cosmos Reason, downloaded over 1 million times and currently at the top of the Physical Reasoning Leaderboard on Hugging Face, can also curate and annotate large sets of real and synthetic data for model training. Cosmos Reason 1 is now available as an easy-to-use NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for AI model deployment. Isaac GR00T N1.6 now lets humanoids move and handle objects simultaneously, allowing more torso and arm freedom to complete tough tasks like opening heavier doors. Developers can post-train Isaac GR00T N models using the open-source NVIDIA Physical AI Dataset on Hugging Face. Downloaded over 4.8 million times, the dataset now includes thousands of synthetic and real-world trajectories. Leading robot makers such as AeiROBOT, Franka Robotics, LG Electronics, Lightwheel, Mentee Robotics, Neura Robotics, Solomon, Techman Robot and UCR are evaluating Isaac GR00T N models for building general-purpose robots. New Cosmos World Foundation Models for Physical AI Development NVIDIA announced new updates to its open Cosmos WFMs, downloaded over 3 million times, that let developers generate diverse data for accelerating training physical AI models at scale using text, image and video prompts. New Workflow for Teaching Robot Grasping Teaching a robot to grab an object is one of the most difficult challenges in robotics. It is not just about moving an arm but turning a thought into a precise action — a skill robots must learn through trial and error. The new dexterous grasping workflow in the developer preview of Isaac Lab 2.3, built on the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform, trains multi-fingered hand and arm robots in a virtual world using an automated curriculum. It starts with simple tasks and gradually ramps up the complexity. The workflow changes aspects like gravity, friction and the weight of an object, training robots to learn skills even in unpredictable environments. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robots learned grasping using this workflow to significantly improve its manipulation capabilities. Leading robot developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Hexagon, Skild AI, Solomon and Techman Robot are adopting NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse technologies. Evaluating Learned Robot Skills in SimulationGetting a robot to master a new skill — like picking up a cup or walking across a room — is incredibly difficult, and testing these skills on a physical robot is slow and expensive. The solution lies in simulation, which offers a way to test a robot’s learned skills against countless scenarios, tasks and environments. But even in simulation, developers tend to build fragmented, simplified tests that do not reflect the real world. A robot that learns to navigate a perfect, simple simulation will fail the moment it faces real-world complexity. To let developers run complex, large-scale evaluations in a simulated environment without having to build the system from scratch, NVIDIA and Lightwheel are codeveloping Isaac Lab - Arena, an open-source policy evaluation framework for scalable experimentation and standardized testing. The framework will be available soon. New NVIDIA AI Infrastructure Powers Robotics Workloads AnywhereTo enable developers to take full advantage of these advanced technologies and software libraries, NVIDIA announced AI infrastructure designed for the most demanding workloads, including: NVIDIA Advances Robotics ResearchNVIDIA technologies, including GPUs, simulation frameworks and CUDA®‑accelerated libraries, were referenced in nearly half of CoRL’s accepted papers — with adoption across leading research labs and institutions such as Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, ETH Zurich and National University of Singapore. Also highlighted at CoRL is BEHAVIOR, a robotic learning benchmark project by the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab and Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform for advancing vision-based tactile robotics, developed by Peking University.

Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions, but its hesitancy still poses a challenge in achieving acceptable coverage. This study was designed to assess the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and identify its influencing factors among healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in Ghana. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test of independence, and multiple logistic regression were assessed from the data collected using Stata version 14 software. A response rate of 78.55% (n = 216/275) was recorded. The majority of the participants were females (n = 135, 62.50%), aged between 20–39 years (n = 204, 94.44%), and were nurses/ midwives (n = 140, 64.81%) followed by medical doctors (n = 43, 19.91%). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 19.91% and the commonly cited reasons for this were apathy (n = 8/43, 18.60%) followed by the belief of not being at risk of infection with the virus (n = 7/43, 16.28%). Hesitancy was reduced by participant’s knowledge of the vaccine effectiveness (aOR= 0.01; CI 95%: 0.001–0.0996; p < 0.001), COVID-19 training (aOR= 0.34; CI 95%: 0.13–0.85; p = 0.022), having a past vaccination history (aOR= 0.18, CI 95%: 0.07–0.45; p < 0.001), and increased by those with the view that vaccine intake should be voluntary (aOR= 3.28; CI 95%: 1.08–10.01; p = 0.037). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was recorded among healthcare workers in this teaching hospital with apathy and belief of no risk to being infected by the virus as commonly cited reasons for this. This is a concern as healthcare workers are expected to be well-informed of the benefits and risks of vaccination. Continuous education on vaccine safety and efficacy can improve vaccine uptake among this population.

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus disease that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 [1]. Since then, the disease has had a significant impact on lives and economies worldwide [2–4]. The outbreak originated as pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China [5]. Ghana recorded its first two cases of COVID-19 on March 12, 2020, and as at June 23, 2024, there had been a total of 775 million cases and 7 million deaths worldwide, with 172,045 cases and 1,462 deaths in Ghana [3,6]. Initial national responses included case identification, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation of infected persons, social distancing, and the widespread use of face masks and hand sanitizers [7]. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions for combating the spread of infectious diseases in the general population [8,9]. According to the WHO, at least 70% vaccination coverage is needed to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism for COVID-19 [10], although higher thresholds have been proposed to address more transmissible variants such as Delta and Omicron [10–12]. Despite this evidence, vaccination campaigns worldwide have been constrained by vaccine hesitancy [13–15]. Vaccine hesitancy is defined by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) as the delay in accepting or refusing vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services [16]. It is acknowledged to be complex, context-specific, and dynamic, shaped by factors of complacency, convenience, and confidence [17,18]. Within Ghana, studies exploring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers have reported divergent findings. For example, Agyekum et al. (2021) documented a hesitancy prevalence of 60.7% among healthcare workers in Accra, a strikingly high figure at the time of early vaccine rollout [19]. Similar rates of such hesitancy have been observed among this group in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries [20–24]. These further highlight the role of vaccine efficacy and safety, availability and accessibility, vaccination history, occupational status, societal and peer influence and conspiracy theories in shaping vaccine attitudes among health professionals in Ghana [19,23–27]. These discrepancies reflect differences in study timing, geographical location, cadre of health workers sampled, and the evolving information environment. Several studies have been conducted globally to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population in most countries [28–32]. Given that healthcare workers are at increased occupational risk and serve as trusted sources of health information for the wider population, understanding the factors underlying their vaccination decisions remains a critical public health priority. However, while several studies have assessed vaccine hesitancy among the general population in Ghana, relatively fewer have focused specifically on healthcare workers and particularly those in teaching hospitals [19,22–24,27,33]. The present study therefore seeks to assess the prevalence and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among frontline clinical staff at Ho Teaching Hospital in the Volta Region of Ghana, thereby contributing to the limited but growing body of Ghanaian evidence on this subject. The study was conducted in Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH), a 354-bed capacity tertiary health facility located in the Volta Regional capital, Ho in Ghana [34]. It has about 1200 clinical and non-clinical staff. The clinical departments in the hospital are Surgery, Internal Medicine, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pharmacy, Laboratory and Radiology. The hospital is patronized by walk-ins and referred clients from the region and clients from neighbouring countries including the Republic of Togo, Benin, and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It provides general and specialised services to about 7000 outpatients and 3000 in-patients every year [35]. The study focused on front-line clinical healthcare workers as they are more likely to come into contact with COVID-19 patients. The targeted study participants included medical doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and laboratory personnel. The breakdown of the target group is as follows: 24 pharmacists, 94 doctors, 110 laboratory personnel, and 862 nurses and midwives. The Raosoft online sample size calculator was used to estimate the sample size. Based on a margin of error of 5%, confidence level of 95%, population size of 1090, and a hesitancy response of 60.7%, which was based on a similar previous study [19], the calculated sample size was 275. The various targeted healthcare workers were recruited based on their calculated population proportional to their size; leading to the recruitment of 24 medical doctors, 6 pharmacists, 217 nurses and midwives and 28 laboratory personnel. The questionnaires were then distributed to them to respond to after they had consented to participate in the study. The data for this study were collected with a structured self-administered questionnaire (supplementary file) that was administered both via Google online form and paper-based questionnaire. Data were collected between 1st June 2023 and 30th August 2023. The questionnaire was adapted from previous similar studies [19,20,23]. It had three sections which consisted of sociodemographic factors including age, sex, religion, marital status, education level and occupation; participants’ job details including type of occupation, years of practice, and role at the COVID-19 treatment at the facility; clinical characteristics and vaccine history including medical history, COVID-19 vaccine type, number of doses and vaccine acceptance/ refusal, participants’ knowledge, and perception concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, and reasons for refusal and acceptance of vaccine. The outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy, and this was defined as one’s refusal to take the vaccine in spite of its availability [16]. The data obtained from the online Google forms and hardcopy questionnaires were entered into a Microsoft Excel version 2016 sheet. The data were then cleaned and imported to Stata version 14 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for analysis. Descriptive statistics in the form of percentages of variables, and then Chi-square test of independence were performed to assess the association between these variables and the outcome variable (status of vaccine hesitancy). Multiple logistic regression was then conducted for the variables that showed statistical significance with a p-value less than 0.05 to assess for the predictors of vaccine hesitancy. Ethical clearance was sought from the Ethics Committees of both the University of Health and Allied Science (UHAS-REC A.7 [46] 22–23) and Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH-REC (36) FC_2022). Written informed consents were sought from both online and in-person participants before the commencement of the study. Information on the participant information leaflet which included study details, and the benefits and risks of participating were given to each participant. Data collected were anonymized to safeguard confidentiality and kept secured with the principal investigator. A total of 216 healthcare workers responded to the survey giving a 78.55% response rate. Majority were females (n = 135, 62.50%) and aged between 20–39 years (n = 204, 94.44%), were Christians (n = 212, 98.15%) and had never been married (n = 147, 68.06%). (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t001 Nurses and midwives (n = 140, 64.81%) were the most common occupation, followed by medical doctors (n = 43, 19.91%), and undergraduate/diploma qualification n = 184, 85.19%) was commonest highest educational level. Majority of them had been practicing for less than 10 years (n = 199, 92.13%). Majority had been previously vaccinated (n = 199, 92.13%). Most of them had no chronic diseases (n = 206, 95.37%) and had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the inception of the pandemic (n = 173, 80.09%). The majority of the respondents did not have a family member who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 184, 85.58%). Most of the healthcare workers had come into contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 152, 70.37%). Most of them had received training on COVID-19 via a lecture mode (n = 132, 61.11%) (Table 1). Of the 216 participants, few of them had refused accepting the COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., hesitant) (n = 43, 19.91%). Most commonly cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy were apathy towards taking the vaccine (n = 8/43, 18.60%), followed by belief of not being at risk of infection with the virus (n = 7/43, 16.28%). 63 out of the 173 participants who delayed in taking the vaccine cited reasons of uncertainty about the long-term adverse effect of vaccine (n = 28/63, 44.44%), and poor accessibility to vaccine (n = 6/63, 9.52%). The most (n = 72/173, 41.62%) commonly cited reason for taking the COVID-19 vaccine was the perceived risk of infection from COVID-19 (41.62%) followed by workplace requirement (n = 34/173, 19.65). The commonest brand of vaccine received by most participants was ChAdOx-1s (n = 92/173, 19.08%), followed by Ad26.COV2-S (n = 33/173, 19.08%). The majority of the participants (149/173, 86.13%) who accepted vaccination received the full dose of the vaccine, and most of them (n = 111/173, 64.16%) did not receive booster doses. (Table 2) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t002 Most (n = 130/216, 60.19%) responded that COVID-19 vaccines should be voluntary for healthcare workers. Furthermore, most (n = 160/216, 74.07%) of them responded that vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19 and that they (n = 185/216, 85.65%) would advise their friends and family to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Most of them responded that their views on the COVID-19 vaccine had not changed over time (n = 139/216, 64.35%). (Table 2) Vaccine hesitancy was associated with gender status (p = 0.031), being a member of the COVID care team (p = 0.019), having received any other vaccination apart from childhood vaccines (p < 0.001), having attended COVID-19 lecture (p = 0.011), view of the vaccine requirement for health workers (p < 0.001), knowledge of the vaccine being an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and whether the person would recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to friends and family (p < 0.001) (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t003 Vaccine hesitancy was predicted by participant’s knowledge of the vaccine being an effective means of preventing and controlling the disease (aOR= 0.01; CI 95%: 0.01–0.00; p < 0.001), COVID-19 training via lecture method (aOR= 0.34; CI 95%: 0.13–0.85; p = 0.022), their view on vaccine requirement for health workers (aOR= 3.28; CI 95%: 1.08–10.01; p = 0.037). past vaccination history (aOR= 0.18, CI 95%: 0.07–0.45; p < 0.001). (Table 4) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t004 This study found a COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy prevalence of 19.91% among frontline clinical healthcare workers at Ho Teaching Hospital. When situated within the broader Ghanaian literature, this prevalence is relatively low. For instance, Agyekum et al. (2021) reported a much higher hesitancy rate of 60.7% among healthcare workers in Accra at the onset of the vaccine rollout [19]. Similarly, Lamptey et al. (2022) and Botwe et al. (2022) documented high levels of uncertainty and refusal in other Ghanaian cohorts [22,27]. In contrast, our findings align more closely with those of Alhassan et al. (2021) in Northern Ghana, who reported that a majority of healthcare workers were willing to accept vaccination, particularly when vaccines were accessible and clear communication was provided [23]. The lower hesitancy we observed may reflect the timing of our study, which was conducted when vaccines were more widely available, when healthcare workers had greater exposure to training and public campaigns, and when local experiences with COVID-19 outcomes may have reinforced the perceived importance of vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers is particularly concerning given its benefits in protecting this vulnerable population due to increased exposure and their critical role in influencing public perception and vaccine uptake [14,15,18]. The finding that hesitancy among healthcare workers was not substantially lower than in the general population in this study and others in Ghana highlights a missed opportunity to leverage healthcare workers as vaccination advocates [30,36,37]. Apathy and a self-perceived low risk of infection emerged as the most frequently cited reasons for hesitancy, agreeing with findings from studies in Saudi Arabia and France [30–32]. This persistent misperception of risk among healthcare workers is concerning, as it may undermine compliance with future vaccination campaigns and weaken broader public health interventions if left unaddressed. This study identified several factors significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Female gender, not having received prior adult vaccinations, lack of COVID-19 training, belief that vaccination should be voluntary, and doubts about the vaccine’s effectiveness were all predictive of hesitancy. Gender has been identified as a predictor of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers [38–40]. The finding of the influence of gender on vaccine hesitancy is consistent with a previous study indicating that female healthcare workers are more likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy, often due to fears surrounding infertility or rare side effects, such as thromboembolic events associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine [40,41]. This is particularly relevant in Ghana, where AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) was the most widely administered vaccine during the initial phases of the vaccination campaign [42]. A negative past vaccination history emerged as a strong predictor of hesitancy (aOR = 0.01, p < 0.001), reaffirming findings from other settings that vaccine confidence is often built on positive historical experiences with immunization [43,44]. Similarly, healthcare workers who had undergone COVID-19 training via lecture mode demonstrated reduced hesitancy (aOR = 0.34, p = 0.022), reinforcing the value of structured educational interventions in promoting vaccine acceptance [16–18]. Another crucial determinant was the belief in the vaccine’s effectiveness to prevent and control COVID-19, which significantly lowered the likelihood of hesitancy (aOR = 0.08, p < 0.001), as was proposed by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy [16]. Notably, healthcare workers who believed that vaccines should be mandatory for healthcare professionals and those who were willing to recommend vaccination to others also showed lower hesitancy, aligning with similar findings in global and African studies [20,43,44]. Despite its valuable contributions, this study has limitations. First, the use of convenience sampling may introduce selection bias and limit the generalizability of findings. Second, the cross-sectional design restricts causal inference, and the use of a single tertiary hospital as the study site may not capture broader national or regional trends. However, the study remains significant as it adds to the limited empirical evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana and highlights the need for context-specific strategies to address misinformation, build vaccine confidence, and support institutional trust. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana, while relatively low, remains a public health concern. The study found that vaccine hesitancy among the study population is primarily driven by apathy, a perceived low risk of infection, and concerns about vaccine safety. Significant predictors of hesitancy included female gender, a lack of prior adult vaccination, absence of formal COVID-19 training, and low confidence in the vaccine’s effectiveness. Conversely, prior vaccination, training via lectures, belief in the vaccine’s protective value, and willingness to recommend it to others were associated with lower hesitancy. The predictors of vaccine hesitancy were participants’ knowledge of the vaccine effectiveness, COVID-19 training via lecture method, health workers’ view on whether the vaccine should be voluntary, and the knowledge of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing and controlling COVID-19. Taken together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana. They confirm that hesitancy is not static but responsive to evolving conditions such as vaccine availability and training opportunities. They also illustrate that interventions must be context-specific, as strategies that are effective in a tertiary teaching hospital may differ from those needed in rural or primary care settings. From a policy perspective, the relatively low hesitancy observed in this study suggests that structured training programs and institutional support can play a critical role in building vaccine confidence among healthcare workers. Targeted education, particularly addressing gender-specific concerns, should be prioritized. Additionally, leveraging positive vaccination histories and ensuring that healthcare workers themselves are well-informed and supported could enhance their role as advocates for vaccination in the general population. By documenting these determinants, this study not only complements earlier Ghanaian reports but also highlights pathways through which vaccine hesitancy can be effectively reduced among health professionals in similar contexts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.s001 (DOCX)

Perturbing visual feedback is a powerful tool for studying visuomotor adaptation. However, unperturbed proprioceptive signals in common paradigms inherently co-varies with physical movements and causes incongruency with the visual input. This can create challenges when interpreting underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We employed a brain–computer interface (BCI) in rhesus monkeys to investigate spatial encoding in frontal and parietal areas during a 3D visuomotor rotation task where only visual feedback was movement-contingent. We found that both brain regions better reflected the adapted motor commands than the perturbed visual feedback during movement preparation and execution. This adaptive response was observed in both local and remote neurons, even when they did not directly contribute to the BCI input signals. The transfer of adaptive changes in planning activity to corresponding movement corrections was stronger in the frontal than in the parietal cortex. Our results suggest an integrated large-scale visuomotor adaptation mechanism in a motor-reference frame spanning across frontoparietal cortices.

Recent advancements have extended this approach to signals obtained from the parietal cortex [7–10]. Besides their translational applications, BCI paradigms provide a crucial tool for studying the neurophysiological basis of motor learning [11–23]. Unlike conventional motor learning paradigms involving physical limb movement, BCI control establishes an experimentally controllable mapping from brain activity to effector motion through the neural decoder. Additionally, BCI paradigms help isolate the impact of visual feedback on movement adaptation by keeping proprioceptive feedback constant during visuomotor perturbations [16]. This approach reduces potential confounds inherent in the adaptation of physical movements, which co-vary with proprioceptive feedback, and emphasizes the visual aspect of feedback control. In our study, we employ a BCI visuomotor rotation paradigm in rhesus monkeys to explore the role of visual feedback and the contributions of parietal and premotor sensorimotor areas to BCI adaptation. We ask whether both brain regions (i) contribute to adaptation irrespective of an immediate impact on the produced motor behavior, (ii) reflect the same or different sensory or motor-related spatial dimensions of fast visuomotor adaptation, and (iii) show adaptation of motor planning activity consistent with motor behavior. In BCI learning, behavioral performance can be improved by exploiting an existing repertoire of neural dynamic states (“within-manifold” learning) or by reconfiguring the neural network structure (“outside-manifold” learning). In response to perturbations of a BCI decoder, short-term learning does not appear to significantly affect the correlation patterns among neurons in the motor cortex [15,20,24]. This suggests that at least the local network structure supplying input to the decoder (i.e., the controlling motor area) remains largely unchanged and constrains neural adaptation during short-term learning. However, with longer-term learning, the brain can be trained to generate new activity patterns in the controlling units that deviate from the expected correlation pattern of the network. Such outside-manifold learning aligns with the view that the tuning of individual neurons can be adapted independently during BCI learning [13,24–25]. A way how the decoder input could be adapted without changing the network structure is by means of “re-association”. According to this view, a specific neural activity pattern associated with compensating for the introduced visuomotor perturbation is recruited from the range of patterns available within the existing network structure [15,18–21]. This view implies changes in activity, but under the constraint of an unchanged network structure also for neighboring neurons, such that also noncontrolling units in the controlling area that do not provide input to the decoder adapt their activity in a manner consistent with changes in the BCI controlling units. Based on these previous findings, we expect that the comparatively fast adaptation to visuomotor rotation, achievable within a single session of a few hundred trials, is accompanied by such re-association learning. After establishing that this is indeed the case in our visuomotor adaptation task, we will test three implications of this hypothesis. First, we will address the question of whether changes in neural activity during BCI learning occur consistently not only in nearby noncontrolling neurons, as shown previously [13,18,28], but also across a larger-scale sensorimotor network, including frontoparietal circuits. Previous studies in humans and monkeys have not extensively examined the extent of adaptation within a distributed neural network, including regions that are not directly involved in generating or updating motor commands but may still play a crucial role in sensorimotor integration. These regions, such as the parietal cortex, are expected to contribute to motor learning [29,30]. In a human BCI motor learning study involving the prefrontal cortex, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), primary motor and sensory cortices, and the posterior parietal cortex, neural changes occurred with long-term learning and were associated nonspecifically with reduced cognitive demand [31]. In contrast, we aim to understand the neural characteristics of fast adaptation, which is particularly desirable for BCI learning and, in conventional visuomotor rotation learning, is often associated with the updating of an internal model [32,33]. Fast adaptation is especially important for BCI applications because it enables users to achieve accurate and efficient control with minimal training time, which is critical for practical and clinical use. We compare the contributions of noncontrolling neurons residing locally next to the BCI controlling neurons in the frontal areas or remotely in parietal areas to test if fast adaptation effects generalize to remote brain regions. Second, we ask whether premotor and parietal brain regions not only both adapt but do so in the same spatial frame of reference. Specifically, we test if neural changes reflect the adapted motor command (this is mandatory for the controlling units, but unclear for noncontrolling units) or if the parietal cortex rather reflects the associated adapted sensory feedback. Preparatory activity in frontoparietal motor planning areas includes information about the reach goal represented in different body-related frames of reference. While encoding at the level of neural populations and often also at the level of the individual neurons shows typically mixed representations of different reference frames, different coding schemes predominate across areas. For example, the parietal reach region (PRR) in the medial intraparietal area (MIP) predominantly encodes reach targets in an eye-centered reference frame [34], whereas area 5d in the posterior parietal cortex represents reach goals more strongly in a hand-centered frame [35]. PRR representations can relate both to the visual location and the physical goal of the movement [36,37]. Nearby sensorimotor areas V6A in the anterior wall of the parieto-occipital sulcus and PEc at its shoulder show gradually more selectivity for the hand position, additionally to target and gaze-related information [38–40]. Similarly, the PMd encodes reach targets in a mixed reference frame, integrating the relative positions of the hand, eye, and target [41,42]. Thus, while both premotor and parietal regions are involved in reach planning and show overlapping tuning properties during instructed delay, they differ with respect to their neuroanatomical embedding. Posterior parietal networks integrate sensory information from multiple modalities, including visual input, and contain motor-goal information during reach planning without directly driving motor output [43,44]. Premotor cortex, on the other hand, has direct connections to primary motor cortex (M1) and its more caudal parts even to spinal cord [45]. Here, we test if these differences between frontal and parietal motor planning areas reflect in differences in the predominant frame of reference when motor command and sensory feedback are dissociated during sensorimotor adaptation. During a visual working memory task, frontoparietal areas can even contain spatial information not related to the body, but relative to a visual object, which is an allocentric form of spatial representation [46]. The possibility of such spatial coding in a reach context, which does not reflect the planned physical arm movement, raises the question in which spatial frame of reference frontoparietal cortex represents reach-associated information during BCI learning and whether parietal and frontal areas share a common frame of reference. Rather than reflecting trial-to-trial updates of the corrected movement to produce adapted motor outputs, as observed in the motor and premotor cortices [11,28,47,48], parietal dynamics could reflect the unchanged sensory state of the system during the planning period before movement onset, as part of its role in state estimation [49–55]. Third, we propose that motor adaptation is reflected in changes in motor signals during movement preparation already and that planning activities co-vary with signals during movement control. Fast adaptation at the neural level has been previously described from a dynamical system perspective [22,23,56–58]. According to this view, the neural state, which represents the activity pattern across the population of neurons in motor areas, follows established dynamics to generate movements [59–63]. During movement preparation, the neural state is initialized with different conditions for different movements and then evolves based on the network-inherent dynamics during movement execution. This concept is particularly applicable to ballistic reaches toward spatially segregated targets in space. The fixed neural dynamics are determined by the stable recurrent connectivity of the network itself [19,61,64]. According to this view, adaptation could be implemented by updating of the initial states. Hence, adaptation induced neural changes should reflect in late planning activity, at a time when uncertainty about the position of a BCI-controlled cursor position deteriorates planning signals [65]. Over the course of fast adaptation, the idea, neural dynamics are initialized with changing conditions to compensate for movement errors from trial to trial, while the network structure in the motor cortex remains stable. A BCI learning study in monkeys indicated that such adaptive state initialization probably applies to BCI controlling units in the motor cortex [23]. In line with this finding, other work suggested that motor learning involves systematic changes in preparatory activity within the motor cortex to adapt to a force field [66]. It is yet unclear to what extent such adaptation of initial states also applies to changes in preparatory activity in the larger frontoparietal network, including noncontrolling units and areas outside the motor cortex. By introducing an instructed delay in the BCI movement task, we can compare adaptation of the preparatory states with the movement-associated dynamics. We ask whether such a relationship between the two states exists also for visuomotor adaptation and whether the relationship changes over the course of learning. In this study, we conducted a 3D visuomotor rotation task under BCI control to investigate neural adaptation across the distributed frontoparietal network, including M1, PMd, and PRR. We selectively connected only a subset of units, referred to as controlling units, to the decoder to assess whether neural signatures of adaptation extend beyond the units immediately controlling the BCI movements. After demonstrating visuomotor rotation adaptation in BCI control of 3D movements and its compatibility with the idea of fast within-manifold learning, we address our three main research questions. First, we test if adaptation is distributed and also affects the coding in parietal areas, remote from the frontal lobe areas that controlled the BCI movements. Second, we determine the spatial frame of reference in which the noncontrolling units co-vary with the controlling units that determine the behavior. Third, we test the hypothesis that re-association learning leads to adaptation of movement planning signals consistent with the observed adaptation in motor behavior. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying movement planning and execution, we designed an experiment to investigate adaptive changes in neural dynamics during a memory-guided reach task under BCI control. Two rhesus monkeys (Y and Z) performed a memory-guided 3D center-out reach task using a computer cursor in a virtual reality (VR) environment (Figs 1A and S1A). The task involved the presentation of a target, followed by a memory period during which the target was no longer visible. The monkeys were then required to move the cursor to the previously cued target in a corner of a 3D cube (Fig 1B). This delay period between target presentation and movement execution allowed us to investigate adaptive changes in neural dynamics during movement planning, independent of immediate sensory feedback, and compare these to the adapted motor commands during execution.

During MC trials, the cursor movements in virtual space were aligned with the animals’ hand movements in physical space. In BCI trials, the monkeys kept their unrestrained hand in a resting position while controlling the cursor mentally. S1B Fig shows that residual hand movements were minimal and barely correlated with cursor speed (Pearson’s correlation: monkey Y, r = 0.085, p < 0.001, n (total number of decoded speeds) = 575,258; monkey Z, r = 0.072, p < 0.001, n = 108,933). This means the animal managed to control the cursor movement without any longer attempting own physical movements, neither during planning nor during movement, which ensured a constant somatosensory input during BCI trials. During baseline trials, i.e., without visuomotor perturbation, monkey Y successfully drove the cursor to the target in 99% of the movement trials (trials in which the animal successfully completed the planning period without, e.g., fixation breaks; see Materials and methods) under MC and in 89% of the BCI trials. Monkey Z succeeded in 97% of the movement trials under MC and in 85% of the BCI trials. Only successful trials were analyzed. We recorded brain activity from three regions: the primary M1, PMd, and PRR. Monkey Y had 64 electrodes in each of M1, PMd, and PRR, while monkey Z had 64 electrodes in M1 and 96 electrodes in each of PMd and PRR (S1C Fig). Units from all three areas were selectively connected (controlling units) or not connected (noncontrolling units) to the decoder (Fig 1D). This design allowed us to investigate whether adaptive mechanisms in individual neurons depended on their immediate causal influence on movement, which is only guaranteed for connected units. Subsets of PMd and M1 units were always involved in the decoder, whereas PRR units were either entirely connected (in combination with PMd-M1; Decoder fronto-parietal (FP), Fig 1D, lower) or completely disconnected (Decoder frontal-only (FO), Fig 1D, upper). This setup enabled us to study adaptive mechanisms in PRR even without its direct involvement in generating movements and to compare it to the case when PRR directly contributes to the control of BCI movements. We utilized a short-term visuomotor rotation (VMR) adaptation paradigm tailored to our 3D experimental setup [67] to induce repeated BCI learning (Fig 2). In the daily sessions, first, the decoder was recalibrated until animals became proficient in controlling unperturbed cursor movements without computer support (see Materials and methods). We then recorded 160 baseline trials before we introduced the perturbation, a rotation of 30° to the visual feedback (cursor) in the fronto-parallel X–Y plane, for 300 trials (Fig 2A). In each daily session, the perturbation was consistently either clockwise or counterclockwise only (S1 Table). The perturbation was applied globally throughout the workspace, which means it affected movements to all eight targets but only in the X and Y dimensions, not in the depth dimension away from the body (Fig 2A, left). Finally, the perturbation was removed during the washout phase, which continued until the animals disengaged from the task (Fig 2A, right). In designing this study, we leveraged previous findings from [67], which showed that human subjects adapted most easily to perturbations applied in the fronto-parallel plane. (A) Left: visual representation of 3D-VMR. In different experimental sessions, the 3D movements were rotated 30° clockwise or counterclockwise in the frontal-parallel plane. The Z-axis points towards the monkey’s head and was unperturbed. Right: the experimental protocol consisted of a baseline phase followed by a 30° VMR and a washout phase where the visual perturbation was removed. Below each phase of the experimental progression, example traces from a single experimental session in Monkey Y are shown. (B) In the plane of the applied perturbation, deviations above the zero line correspond to positions in the visual signal plane. Conversely, negative deflections in trajectories exist in the motor signal plane and correspond to the motor commands issued to counteract the visual perturbation. For averaging across all target directions, the trajectories were rotated into a shared reference frame. One axis was aligned with the perturbed direction, while the other was aligned with the vector from the center to the target. In this plane, trajectories above the zero line represent positions in the visual signal plane, while trajectories below zero pertain to the motor signal plane. Additionally, we calculated the angle at the midpoint of each trajectory as the angle between the perturbation direction and the vector from the center to the target. (C) For the analysis, the 3D trajectories were projected onto the 2D plane of the applied perturbation. The trajectories showed stereotypical adaptation profiles during rotation and negative aftereffects during washout. (D) The angle at the midpoint of the trajectory, plotted as a function of trial number, reveals stereotypical adaptation profiles in response to the introduced VMR. The perturbation angle approaches 30° upon perturbation introduction, gradually decreases with learning, and then deviates in the opposite direction during the washout phase following perturbation removal. Numerical data are available in S1 Data. (A) Left: visual representation of 3D-VMR.

Numerical data are available in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g002 To visualize movement adaptation, we projected the 3D movement trajectories of the controlled cursor into the X–Y plane affected by the perturbation (perturbation plane). During the baseline phase, the trajectories were on average relatively straight toward the target. During early rotation trials, as expected as a consequence of the perturbed feedback, trajectories in the perturbation plane curved in the direction of the applied feedback perturbation (Fig 2A, right). The average trajectories were less curved in late rotation trials. In the early washout phase, the trajectories on average curved in the opposite direction compared to during perturbation. The reduced curvature in late rotation trials and inverse curvature observed during washout indicate successful adaptation, which we quantified jointly across all target directions. To obtain averaged trajectories across targets, we rotated them for each target such that the X-axis aligned with the center-to-target direction and the Y-axis aligned orthogonally to this (perturbation direction, Fig 2B; see Materials and methods). Fig 2C depicts the average cursor trajectories across all eight targets and for all sessions for monkey Y. Additionally, the corresponding “motor” signal, representing the trajectories that would be produced by the unperturbed decoder using the neural activity of the controlling units, is visualized (Fig 2B–2C). To quantify adaptation, we calculated the trial-by-trial angular movement error (α) from the starting direction of the movement. To have a good enough estimate of movement direction while keeping the influence of online movement corrections small, we measured the angle of the cursor position at the halfway point of the trajectory relative to the straight line connecting the starting position and the target position (Fig 2C). On average, during baseline trials, the angular error was close to zero and did not decrease over time, as the fitted data with exponential decay did not show significant differences from zero (Monkey Y: intercept = 0.637, p = 0.26, decay = 0.006, p = 0.43, n = 51; Monkey Z: intercept = 1.5, p = 0.26, decay = 0.0029, p = 0.8, n = 15). It increased to about 20° at the onset of the VMR perturbation and gradually decreased as the monkeys adapted their neural activity to regain better control (Fig 2D). Fitting the data with an exponential decaying function during the perturbation phase indicated significant visuomotor adaptation (Monkey Y: n = 51, intercept = 20.99, p < 0.001, decay = −0.0026, p < 0.001; Monkey Z: n = 15, intercept = 20.69, p < 0.001, decay = −0.0018, p = 0.0017). During the washout phase, movement errors were committed in the opposite direction to the applied perturbation, consistent with a negative aftereffect as typically seen in visuomotor rotation adaptation. Fitting the data with an exponential decay revealed a significant intercept for both animals (Monkey Y: intercept = −11.63, p < 0.001, n = 26; Monkey Z: intercept = −17.255, p = 0.0018, n = 4), indicating significant aftereffects for both animals. These findings suggest a change in the sensorimotor transformation achieved during BCI adaptation trials. In BCI-controlled movements, behavioral changes represented by the cursor on the screen (i.e., the decoder output) directly mirror the activity of the neural population that controls the decoder. When faced with a VMR-type perturbation, this controlling neural group can restore its performance by re-associating certain target directions with different movement directions [15,18]. The re-association hypothesis means that the neurons can direct the cursor to the desired target using activity patterns consistent with those observed during the center-out reach task on which they were originally trained, associating a direction suited to compensate for the perturbing rotation. In contrast to the re-configuration hypothesis, the covariance structure between different neurons should change very little with re-associations, since the network remains stable. This stability implies that the neural dynamics that define the low-dimensional neural subspace (i.e., the neural manifold), which explains most of the neural variance before adaptation (during baseline), also explain most of the variance during perturbation and after adaptation (washout). To test the re-association versus re-configuration hypothesis, we calculated the alignment index [62] of the neural manifolds between the baseline trials and the other experimental phases (S2 Fig). Alignment should be high in the case of re-association. The alignment index is computed as the ratio of the explained variance when projecting the neural activity from the other experimental phases onto the principal components (PCs) derived from the baseline activity (see Materials and methods section). We focused on the first four PCs, which capture the majority of the variance in the baseline trials (S3A, S3C, S3E, and S3G Fig). Supporting the re-association hypothesis, we find that a substantial portion of the initially explained variance remains constant throughout the learning process. In fact, the average difference between the alignment indices during late rotation and the cross-validated alignment index during baseline is smaller than 1% for all the different neural populations that we calculated (S2 Fig). This suggests a preservation of the manifold structure during VMR adaptation in the frontal motor network. Our primary research goal was to identify the spatial reference frames of movement parameters encoded by neurons without a direct causal link to the movement (noncontrolling units) in frontal versus parietal brain areas. During BCI movements, noncontrolling units could encode movement parameters in either a visual coordinate system (reflecting the cursor movement) or a physical coordinate system (reflecting intended limb movements). To distinguish between these spatial encoding strategies, we used an offline decoding approach to reconstruct movement trajectories from noncontrolling units. First, a Kalman filter (KF) decoder (as for online decoding) was trained offline with neural activity of the noncontrolling units during BCI baseline trials (training set, Fig 3A) to reproduce the cursor trajectories actually produced by the animal with the controlling units during baseline. During unperturbed baseline trials, these trajectories represent both the motor command (of the controlling units) and visual cursor feedback alike, since both are spatially congruent (identical except for sensory noise). (A) Schematic illustration of the offline decoding principle during the movement period. A velocity Kalman filter decoder was applied to reconstruct theoretical memory trajectories from neural activity (first column). During the movement period, real BCI trajectories were used for regression with neural firing rates from noncontrolling neurons during baseline trials (second column, training set). After calibration during baseline trials, the decoder was used to reconstruct continuous trajectories during perturbation trials (third column). The example averaged trajectories demonstrate continuous movements toward the target. In the last column, the reconstructed 3D trajectory from the offline decoder is projected onto the perturbation plane for perturbation trials. These projections assess visual-like or motor-like encoding, where positive deviations along this axis correspond to the visual signal, and negative deflections indicate motor output during adaptation.

Numerical data are available in S2 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g003 Second, this decoder was then applied to the neural activity during VMR trials of the same neural population (test set, Fig 3A). During VMR trials, the motor command of the controlling units and the visual cursor feedback are spatially incongruent. This allows us to test which spatial reference frame the noncontrolling units better correspond to. More specifically, the projection of the decoded trajectories along the perturbation axis (deflection measure) allowed us to study whether neural activity of the noncontrolling units during adaptation reflects (i) a stationary, nonadaptive signal (H1), (ii) the adapting visual cursor trajectories (H2), or (iii) the adapting motor signal as produced by the controlling units (H3). Straight trajectories to the target as during baseline would reflect a nonadaptive signal in noncontrolling populations, corresponding to a lack of deviation in the perturbation direction (Fig 3A). Deviation from baseline deflecting in the positive direction of the perturbation axis would reflect the visual signal (visual signal plane; corresponding to perturbation direction greater than 0), while deflection in the negative direction would reflect the motor command (motor signal space; corresponding to perturbation direction <0). In our results, the negatively deflected reconstructed trajectories in both animals show that noncontrolling units in M1 and PMd reflect the motor command similarly to controlling units (Fig 3B–3C). To accurately capture this deflection, we used a trajectory deflection measure in our analysis. This approach differs from the angular movement error (α) that we previously calculated to quantify adaptation, where α was measured at the midpoint of the trajectory relative to the straight line connecting the starting and target positions (Fig 2C). We chose the deflection measure for the reconstructed trajectories because it accounts for the overall shape and direction of the entire movement path. The mean deflection of the activity of monkey Y at the end of the movement (100%) was −8.69 mm ± 4.43 mm (mean ± standard deviation), significantly different from zero (one-sample t test, t(50) = −14.010, p < 0.001). For monkey Z, the mean deflection of activity at the end of the movement was also significantly below zero, at −9.88 mm ± 5.27 mm (t(14) = −7.250, p < 0.001). To isolate area-specific adaptation between M1 and PMd, we also tracked how each neuron’s preferred direction (PD) evolved during learning. This analysis revealed robust, systematic PD rotations that were independently measurable in both M1 and PMd (S4 Fig). These tuning shifts are well-aligned to partially compensate for the experimentally induced visual rotation. To gain deeper insight into the level of adaptation achieved by the noncontrolling neuronal population, we calculated the angle representing the deviation in the perturbation direction at the final level of adaptation. This angle was measured between the reconstructed trajectory of each population and the direct path to the target. To compare the adaptation levels across different populations, we then scaled the final angle reached by each neural subpopulation relative to that of the controlling unit population and called this the “relative gain.” The relative gain quantifies the deviation along the perturbation axis relative to the level of adaptation achieved. By expressing these deviations as a fraction of the total adaptation level exhibited by the controlling units, we could assess and compare how much each population contributed to adapting to the perturbation. Specifically, the M1-PMd noncontrolling population reached a relative gain of 59% for Monkey Y and 94% for Monkey Z, underscoring the significant adaptation observed in the M1-PMd noncontrolling population. We next investigated how VMR adaptation affects PRR activity, focusing on whether PRR’s adaptation-associated neural dynamics share the same spatial frame of reference as the frontal regions. By analyzing the adaptation process in PRR both with direct influence on movement control (decoder FP, controlling PRR units) and without it (decoder FO, noncontrolling PRR units), we determined whether PRR predominantly mirrors visual feedback or plays an active role similar to frontal areas. The overall neural yield in PRR was lower than in the combined M1-PMd recordings for both subjects. To still achieve similar baseline performance across conditions and to have enough noncontrolling units in PRR for analysis, the controlling PRR neurons were combined with a subset of M1-PMd units in the FP decoder sessions. This design choice was motivated by the fact that we observed lower performance in pre-testing trials when using PRR alone, possibly due to its weaker motor coding properties. Still, this experimental strategy allowed us to compare adaptation of PRR while partially causing the movement or not causing it directly at all. First, we evaluated whether the respective contributions of M1-PMd and PRR to the cursor movement were balanced during FP decoding, or rather predominated by M1-PMd inputs. Each cell’s contribution was determined by multiplying the norm of the vector that translates decoded speed into its firing rate summed with its baseline firing rate (Fig 4A), a similar approach as described in [68]. The distributions of the contribution values differed only modestly between PRR and M1-PMd (Cohen’s d: d = 0.67 for Monkey Y, d = 0.38 for Monkey Z). This suggests that both the PRR and M1-PMd areas similarly drive the motor output of the decoder. We also ensured that after baseline trials, neither of these areas significantly decreased their firing rate during adaptation which might indicate a substantial silencing of the area. Average firing rates between baseline and adaptation did not differ significantly (Mann–Whitney test, p > 0.05; Fig 4B). Together, these results indicate an active contribution of PRR to decoder adaptation.

Numerical data are available in S3 Data. (B) Mean firing rates for PRR and M1-PMd controlling units during baseline and late rotation epochs show that neither PRR nor M1-PMd is reducing their firing rate when compared to baseline (all p values nonsignificant with Mann–Witney test, n = 11 for Monkey Y, n = 5 for Monkey Z).

Numerical data are available in S2 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g004 Changes in PRR activity in response to the VMR exhibited motor-like characteristics similar to M1-PMd (Fig 4C). Across both decoder configurations (FP and FO), significant deflections from zero were observed at the end of movement. For monkey Y, under FP decoding, the mean deflection was −1.64 ± 1.56 mm (t(10) = −3.48, p = 0.006); under FO, −1.85 ± 2.25 mm (t(39) = −5.20, p < 0.001). For monkey Z, under FP decoding, deflection was −10.90 ± 2.87 mm (t(4) = −8.49, p = 0.001); under FO, −5.18 ± 5.08 mm (t(4) = −12.37, p = 0.0001). These results indicate a motor-like encoding during adaptation, qualitatively similar to M1-PMd (Fig 4C). Even when PRR was not contributing to the control of the decoder, an equivalent pattern of adaptation was observed, indicating motor-related changes rather than representation of the visual feedback. For the PRR controlling units, Monkey Y showed a 13% relative gain to the final adaptation, while Monkey Z showed 64%. When PRR was noncontrolling, Monkey Y showed a 14% relative gain, and Monkey Z achieved 37%. In summary, our findings suggest that PRR exhibits substantial motor-like encoding during movement adaptation, even when it is not directly controlling the movement, highlighting its involvement in the adaptation process. This indicates that PRR plays a more integral role in motor adaptation than merely reflecting visual feedback. An important aspect of our study design is to compare movement planning and execution to understand the dynamics of neural adaptation. Specifically, we ask whether motor preparation and the associated initial states of neural dynamics are updated trial-by-trial during adaptation, or if only online motor control changes during BCI learning. The transition between planning and movement phase was comparable in the BCI and MC contexts. We applied a PC decomposition and cross-projected the neural activity during planning onto the dimensions that best explained the activity during movement. We found that the explained variance in the planning activity, when projected into the first four dimensions of the movement subspace, was significantly reduced in comparison to the movement activity (S3 Fig, paired t test, all comparisons p < 0.001. Monkey Y, MC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.46, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.86, t(49); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.87, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.91, t(49). BC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.67, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.92, t(49); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.88, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.96, t(49). Monkey Z, MC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.53, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.76, t(14); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.63, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.74, t(14). BC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.62, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.83, t(14); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.79, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.87, t(14)). The subspace misalignment was more pronounced in frontal areas compared to parietal areas in both monkeys. The alignment patterns were equivalent in both manual and BCI trials. These results show substantial differences between the manifold structure in the planning and movement phases not only in MC but also in BCI. We attribute these change in neural state to a transitions from planning while not attempting cursor movements during the delay period to actually producing a cursor move towards the target during the movement period. If the animals had attempted cursor movements during the delay period of the BCI trials already, the release of the cursor blockade at the end of the delay period would have led to an immediate cursor movement, since neural response modulations directly affect cursor movements in BCI control. Instead, what we observed in BCI trials were neural response latencies from the go cue that were similar to, or even longer than those during manual reaches (animal Y: MC activity peak 259.55 ± 31.58 ms versus BCI 255.05 ± 29.09 ms; animal Z: MC activity peak 353.05 ± 43.13 ms versus BCI 463.72 ± 43.86 ms; see S3I Fig). To better understand how the FP network adjusts to altered feedback, we examined changes not just during the control of movement but also during its planning phase. To measure neural changes during planning, we employed an offline decoder approach similar to the one used for studying the movement phase. For planning, similar to movement decoding, we trained the decoder with baseline trials but used neural activity from the memory period. Unlike movement decoding, this training involved regressing the firing rates against a directional vector that continuously pointed to the cued target. Decoding the direction every 50 ms enabled us to reconstruct hypothetical 3D trajectories offline during the planning phase. For each target direction, we took the 400 ms time interval before the ‘go’ cue. We then calculated the vector sum of the individual unit vectors, each pointing in the direction decoded within that specific time bin (Fig 5A). The hypothetical trajectories we produced stem from a direct projection of the neural space into the 3D task space through the decoder, reflecting the intended direction during planning. In essence, these trajectories transform neural activity into a space where variations are explicitly linked to the task space (via the decoder), such as aiming at a target. To validate our decoding methodology during the planning phase, we identified the intended targets by determining the closest target to the final position attained at the conclusion of the planning phase for each reconstructed trajectory within the task space (using an 8-way discrete classifier). In our baseline trials, the decoder produced hypothetical trajectories in the task space that were consistent with the intended target (S5 Fig). (A) Schematic illustration of the offline decoding principle during the memory period. As previously described for movement decoding, a velocity Kalman filter decoder was applied to reconstruct theoretical memory trajectories from neural activity (first column). During the memory period, a unity vector always pointing at the target was used for regression with neural firing rates (second column, training set). After calibration during baseline trials, the decoder was used to reconstruct continuous trajectories during perturbation trials (third column). The example averaged trajectories demonstrate continuous movements toward the target. In the last column, the reconstructed 3D trajectory from the offline decoder is projected onto the perturbation plane for perturbation trials. These projections assess visual-like or motor-like encoding, where positive deviations along this axis correspond to the visual signal, and negative deflections indicate motor output during adaptation. (B) The reconstructed trajectories in the perturbed dimension exhibit a negative deflection, indicating re-aiming, even during the planning period. At the end of the trajectory, a box plot compares all M1-PMd neurons with zero. The whiskers represent the 5th and 95th percentiles. Numerical data are available in S4 Data.

Numerical data are available in S4 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g005 Equivalent to the analyses during movement, we tested the decoder’s generalization to quantify adaptation and its spatial frame of reference. This was done by training it during the memory phase of the baseline trials and then applying it during the memory phase of the rotation trials. Much like neural activity observed during movement, any deviations in the reconstructed hypothetical trajectories (once projected onto the perturbation direction) would suggest either motor- or visual-like adaptation. We quantified this in a manner equivalent to how we assessed data during movement control (Fig 5A, right side). For both monkeys, the controlling and noncontrolling units in the M1-PMd regions exhibited motor-like adaptation during the planning phase. This demonstrates the use of a re-association strategy in a motor-reference frame during motor planning (Fig 5B). In the PRR, re-association in a motor-reference frame during planning could also be observed. Differences were statistically significant for the individual monkeys in either only the controlling units (monkey Y) or in the noncontrolling units (monkey Z) with nonsignificant trends in the respective other group of neurons (S6 Fig). By extracting the re-associated movement directions in both the planning and movement periods, we tested whether the observed level of trial-by-trial adaptation during planning predicts the adaptation levels during movement. We correlated the deviations of the decoded trajectories from a direct-to-target trajectory towards the end of the planning period (400 ms before go cue) with the deviations observed during movement 200 ms after the go cue for each trial (Fig 6A). We chose the early 200 ms deflection in the movement to reduce the impact of feedback-driven online corrections, which would be anticipated at later intervals. A positive correlation would support the hypothesis that adaptation is mostly achieved by adapting the initial conditions prior to the onset of movement, while movement-associated neural dynamics remain comparably stable. It’s important to note that trajectories in the task space are theoretical during the planning phase and are decoded differently (see Materials and methods) than during the movement phase. Therefore, the regression slope between the planning and the movement trajectories is in arbitrary units. However, relative values in the slope across brain regions, different neuronal groups, or between the initial and advanced stages of adaptation can still signify the ratio at which changes related to adaptation during planning manifest as dynamic changes during movement. (A) Schematic representation of the analysis method. The reconstructed trajectories at the end of the planning period were regressed against those at 200 ms into the movement phase to test if adaptation levels during planning correlate with those during movement. For each axis, they represent the values assumed for each trial along the perturbation dimension in the specific period (planning and movement). (B) Multi-comparison of regression slopes for all controlling and noncontrolling populations. The slopes were extracted using a multiple linear regression model from data collected from two animals, with random factors considered. Paired multiple comparisons were deemed significant for an interaction effect between the two tested populations with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). The error bars indicate 95% Bonferroni-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals as estimated by the model. (C) Graphical representation of learning-related changes in slope.

This model incorporates the trial number (perturbation trials) as an interaction factor to examine if the relationship evolves during adaptation. We applied a combined model, accounting for both animals, with the individual animal as a random factor and the day of the experiment nested within the animal random factor. Additionally, we separated the analysis for different brain areas and further categorized it based on controlling and noncontrolling units. Significant correlations were observed between deflections during planning and movement across all brain areas, but not all subgroups of neurons (Fig 6B). For controlling and noncontrolling M1-PMd populations, slopes were significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0085, respectively), indicating correlations. Similarly, for PRR noncontrolling units, a significant correlation was observed (p < 0.001). For PRR controlling units, such a relationship was not evident (p = 0.30). When we compared the slope values across all controlling and noncontrolling populations in the absence of the interaction parameter, we noticed a significant difference in every comparison (Fig 6B). The linear relationship between planning and movement was already apparent during the baseline BCI trials and, though less pronounced, also during the MC trials (S7 Fig). The fact that neural states during late planning and initial movement are correlated indicates that adaptation-induced changes during planning manifest as dynamic changes during movement. We next ask if this relationship remains unchanged over the course of learning, implying a stable relationship between initial state before movement and consecutive motor-related dynamics, or if the relationship evolves as learning progresses, implying a dynamic interplay changing the “gain” with which neural adaptations during planning are linked to changes in movement execution. The regression slope changes for both controlling and noncontrolling neural populations in PMd-M1, as well as in the noncontrolling population of PRR (Fig 6C shows the first half of the trials versus the second half of the trials). This change is indicated by a significant interaction of correlation strength with trial number in our model (for M1-PMd controlling p_change_slope < 0.001, for M1-PMd noncontrolling p_change_slope = 0.0053, for PRR noncontrolling p_change_slope = 0.023, for PRR controlling p_change_slope = 0.4. This suggests that, over time, the same degree of neural adaptation during the planning phase results in more pronounced motor corrections (interaction M1-PMd controlling: 0.000223, interaction M1-PMd noncontrolling: 0.00010. At the same time this translates in the opposite effect in PRR noncontrolling (interaction effect: −0.00010). Previous studies on motor learning in primates have predominantly focused on the motor cortex in 2D settings [11,22,23,47,56,58]. Here, we investigated the adaptive mechanisms underlying short-term adaptation in a distributed network involving both frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas. By employing a VMR task in 3D movements, we explored motor adaptation and the associated neural dynamics with the same dimensionality as natural movements [69], reducing physical constraints. To minimize potential confounds arising from changes in cross-modal congruency due to the applied perturbation, we employed a BCI paradigm which removes movement-contingent proprioceptive feedback. By selectively manipulating the remaining task-relevant visual feedback and exclusively controlling movements through observed neurons feeding into the BCI decoder, we gained precise control over the sensorimotor loop and associated transformations [16,17]. Furthermore, we utilized memory-guided reaches to examine how motor planning activity and its relationship to movement are influenced by learning in both frontal and parietal sensorimotor regions. Our findings revealed coherent neural adaptation in a motor-reference frame across both frontal and parietal motor areas, i.e., including the parietal region remote from the frontal neurons controlling the BCI. This adaptation was observed in both planning- and movement-related activity, regardless of whether the neurons controlled BCI movements or not. Our results suggest the presence of a distributed mechanism of “re-association” which is happening in a motor-reference frame and influences initial states of movement associated neural dynamics during movement-planning already, both in frontal and parietal cortices. A key finding of our study on BCI-VMR is that even neurons in the PRR area exhibit changes in neural activity during adaptation. Notably, this change is evident even though PRR neurons do not directly govern BCI movements and are remote from the controlling units in PMd-M1. By maintaining a consistent physical state (posture) during BCI movements, we ensured that proprioceptive input remained constant. Consequently, sensory changes induced by perturbations were confined to the visual cursor, which was directly and solely managed by the controlling units via the decoder [16]. Therefore, the decoder input represents the motor command, while its output corresponds to the task-relevant sensory feedback. Additionally, using offline decoding, we could analyze the encoding in groups of neurons not involved in online control. Earlier research has highlighted the preservation of covariance and neural manifold structures during short-term BCI learning tasks in the motor cortex’s controlling units [15,20]. We expand this notion by demonstrating that both noncontrolling motor cortex units and PRR units adapt, while preserving their correlation structure (S3 Fig). This within-manifold adaptation suggests that the constraints imposed by the underlying neural circuitry remains relatively unchanged during VMR learning [20,70,71]. Our findings indicate that a correlated network structure is maintained within the widespread frontoparietal sensorimotor cortices during fast BCI adaptation. In this study, we chose to apply a perturbation in the fronto-parallel plane, as we previously found that subjects adapt most easily to visual perturbations of the cursor in this orientation. It remains an open question whether perturbations around other axes, which have been shown to be more difficult to learn in a human VMR study [67], might require more complex changes in neural activity, potentially extending beyond the intrinsic manifold. On the other hand, mixed representations of neural information about reach direction and distance (depth) in posterior parietal cortex [72–74] and also in PMd [75] do not suggest fundamental differences between dimensions. Our findings indicate that noncontrolling M1-PMd and PRR units reflect adaptive changes in the same motor-related spatial frame of reference that controlling units use. In other words, the changes in noncontrolling units predominantly reflect the adapted movement directions that the controlling units have to produce to counteract the feedback perturbation. The uniform encoding of the movement-associated corrective variable across the frontoparietal network may facilitate efficient information exchange within a closed-loop system for motor corrections, especially involving direct PRR engagement [76]. Our results add to previous work in which parietal area 5 was found to encode motor errors, and where electrically stimulating this area generated movements opposite to the PD of the stimulated cells [77], in line with results from motor areas M1 and PMd [78]. The conclusion that PRR generates a signal in the same frame of reference as the motor areas, in our case, is based on the analysis of neural population responses during a motor adaptation task, without a potentially confounding co-varying proprioceptive feedback. In tasks that impose a rule, requiring animals to learn and apply overt, context-specific stimulus-response associations, such as an anti-reach task [79], animals might be able to use an “explicit” strategy and solve context-specific spatial remapping of a target stimulus onto the motor goal by re-associating different neural dynamics with preexisting neural manifolds [36]. A closely related form of rule-based, explicit learning has been documented in discrete BCI experiments in monkeys [18] and humans [21]. Those studies employed a binary classifier to choose one of two targets, with the “cursor” shown only at the start and end of each trial, so continuous movement-contingent feedback was absent. Because the subject must discover and then apply a categorical association, the resulting adaptation may be based on an explicit strategy. The corresponding neural adaptation has been termed intrinsic-variable learning, i.e., re-association that reuses a preexisting neural manifold. Our experiment differs in at least one key aspect. We used a continuous VMR paradigm in which the cursor was visible throughout the reach, providing a moment-by-moment error signal since the feedback deviated from the expected feedback in perturbation trials. Under these circumstances, human psychophysics with classical VMR tasks often suggest primarily implicit recalibration of the visuomotor map [32,67,80,81]. Yet, learning in continuous VMR tasks may also involve a mixture of implicit recalibration and explicit re-aiming strategies [82]. Moreover, explicit processes themselves are not unitary but consist of dissociable strategies that interact with implicit recalibration in flexible ways [83]. The balance between these processes depends strongly on preparation time: explicit re-aiming requires longer preparation intervals, whereas restricting preparation to ~250 ms suppresses its use and yields behavior dominated by implicit adaptation [84,85]. Since our task design included a delay period prior to movement initiation, it may have provided the animals with additional opportunity to engage explicit strategies. Thus, while we interpret the re-association signals we observe across PMd, M1, and PRR as likely reflecting implicit recalibration, we cannot rule out contributions from explicit re-aiming. In either case, our findings reinforce that re-association is a general neural mechanism, expressed not only in rule-based explicit tasks but also in predominantly implicit adaptation contexts such as continuous VMR. In our study, we probed the trial-by-trial adaptation within the frontoparietal network during the movement planning phases. Specifically, we were keen to understand how re-association processes during planning are transferred to the execution of movement. Drawing from dynamical systems theory, we considered the possibility that neural activity during planning could establish the initial conditions, thereby guiding the dynamical system to produce adapted movements without the need for explicit cognitive computation [60] or enhanced restructuring of the network. Our observations revealed linear correlations between trial-by-trial adjustments of planning and movement activity, evident in both controlling and noncontrolling units of frontal motor areas M1-PMd and, less pronounced, in noncontrolling units of PRR. From a dynamical systems perspective, this suggests that the adaptation of initial states to define updated starting conditions for the following dynamic evolution of states during movement might be particularly true for frontal, but less for parietal areas. Additionally, we found an enhancement of this relationship over the learning phase, indicating that changes during planning translated to more pronounced changes in movement in the later adaptation phase. This suggests that not only the motor error was reduced, but also that the adaptive mechanism became more efficient over the course of learning. These findings partly challenge the notion of a linear dynamical system in motor learning, suggesting that the dynamical system itself may undergo changes. However, [86] offer an complementary perspective, proposing that evolving relationships may reflect the brain’s effort to optimize its energetic costs. In this model, efficient control strategies favor selectively targeting dimensions that most impact future motor outcomes, reducing redundant preparatory effort. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that as learning progressed, adjustments in planning became more effective in driving corrective changes in movement. This shift implies that less extensive re-association during planning could still enable more substantial corrections during movement, aligning with the view that learning serves not only to reduce error but also to refine the efficiency of neural control mechanisms in an energetically optimal way. We conducted a comparative analysis of online and offline decoding, revealing that all neurons, including noncontrolling units, coherently encode a corrective variable during motor control to counteract visuomotor rotations. This re-association mechanism, previously observed in motor areas, supports efficient information transfer in a feedback control-loop [11,15,18,21,28]. Additionally, our results indicate that re-association during planning can predict movement correction, although their relationship varies throughout learning and depends on the area and causal relationship between the area and the BCI movement. During the later stages of adaptation, it appears that less re-association is required during planning to achieve a specific degree of movement adaptation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that generalized adaptation mechanisms operate within a distributed neural network during three-dimensional movements, offering insights into neural manifold structures and motor error correction. By employing a VMR task in a 3D workspace and using a BCI, we captured spatial encoding and motor adaptation without physically constraining movements and independently controlling sensorimotor transformations from proprioceptive feedback. Our findings highlight the critical role of an integrated motor and parietal sensorimotor network in adaptation. Both frontal and parietal regions primarily encode adapted motor commands rather than merely responding to perturbed visual feedback, supporting the re-association hypothesis of VMR learning. Moreover, learning-associated changes occurred not only in neurons controlling the BCI output but also in neurons not directly connected to the BCI, indicating a widespread mechanism of motor adaptation. Finally, neural adaptation manifests in both planning and movement-related activities across the brain, with learning-associated changes in the correlation between these phases. This relationship evolved particularly within frontal areas during learning, suggesting different adaptation trajectories in frontal versus parietal regions. Our results underscore the distributed nature of adaptation within neural networks underlying motor control and highlight the importance of this network in fine-tuning spatial encoding for precise movement correction. All procedures and experiments were authorized by the relevant regional authority (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit [LAVES]) under the permit numbers 3,392,42502-04-13/1100 and 33.19-42502-04-18/2823, and fully conformed to German law and the European Directive 2010/63/EU governing the use of animals in scientific research. The setup allowed the animals to perform reaching movements in a three-dimensional VR environment [67,87]. The animals were seated in a dark room with two monitors (BenQ XL2720T, 27-inch diagonal, 1920 × 1080 px, 60 Hz refresh rate) positioned on either side (Fig 1A). They looked through two semi-transparent mirrors (75 × 75 mm, 70R/30T, Edmund Optics) angled at 45° relative to the monitors. This created a stereoscopic 3D virtual impression in front of the subjects. The monitors were tilted 30° relative to the horizontal plane so that the workspace was projected below eye level, allowing the animals to perform ergonomic arm movements in front of their body. To optimize the perception of the virtual workspace, the interpupillary distance of the monkeys was measured (Monkey Y = 33.2 mm, Monkey Z = 33.1 mm). The setup software and screen projections were then calibrated to these individual values to minimize discrepancies between the images for the left and right eyes. Eye position was tracked at 2 kHz (EyeLink 1000 Plus, SR Research LTD, Ottawa, Canada), and the gaze was required to be maintained on the central fixation point during the memory period (see below). The custom-written task controller was implemented in C++, allowing simultaneous tracking of multiple interfaces including the BCI, the eye and the hand tracking systems [88]. The BCI was implemented as a Matlab program running an online loop, which communicated with the task controller via a Matlab implementation of the VRPN library through a MEX file [89]. Neural data were not just recorded to hard drives but also processed online through a MEX interface provided by the recording system (Cerebus, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) to extract spike counts (see below). The loop operated every 50 ms in consecutive nonoverlapping time windows. During BCI trials, the cursor was automatically placed at the central fixation point during the holding phase and after the movement was completed (see task description below). Four infrared cameras tracked the position of four passive markers centered on the monkey’s palm in real-time (Fig 1A) at 100 Hz. The two animals were trained to wear a 3D-printed plastic framework containing the four reflective markers arranged around the right wrist. The center of geometry of the four markers was tracked using four Vicon Bonita B10 cameras (Vicon, Oxford, UK) and aligned with the midpoint of the palm. To facilitate accurate tracking and control in the VR setup, we performed two calibrations. First, we calibrated the cameras to stream the center of geometry of the markers attached to the monkey’s wrist. We added an extra marker at the position of the monkey’s wrist, which served as the reference point during this calibration. Using Vicon Tracker 1.3.1 software (Vicon), we adjusted the center of geometry of the four markers to align with this additional marker. This allowed the software to stream the position of the center of geometry online to the task controller, ensuring that this position corresponded accurately to the monkey’s wrist position in the physical setup. Second, we calibrated the camera space with the task controller space to ensure proper alignment between the virtual environment and the physical setup. During this calibration, a human operator co-registered the cursor position and the displayed target positions using semi-transparent mirrors. This process translated the coordinates from Vicon space to the task space, allowing the VR system to accurately reflect the monkey’s movements within the task environment.[67]. Two Rhesus monkeys performed a 3D, memory-guided, and center-out reach task (Fig 1B). At the beginning of each trial, during the decoder calibration phase, the animals were required to acquire and maintain a central fixation point with both their hand and gaze for 400 ms (fixation period). Following this, one of eight targets, positioned at the vertices of a 70 mm-sided cube and centered around the fixation point, was briefly displayed for 300 ms (cue period). The animals had to continue holding their hand and gaze at the center of the cube for an additional 400 ms (planning period), followed by a variable delay of up to 600 ms. After the delay, the central fixation target disappeared, signaling the animals to move toward the target (movement period), with a timeout limit of 1,500 ms. During BCI control trials, the cursor movement was controlled by a neural decoder. The task remained identical to the MC task that had been used for calibration. If, at any point, the animals directed their gaze outside a 30 mm tolerance window around the fixation point or moved their hand more than 15 mm from its starting position (security radius) during the fixation period, the trial was aborted. MC trials were employed to calibrate a biomimetic velocity KF decoder, which was subsequently used to perform the BCI trials (Fig 1C, BCI). Once the animals became proficient in controlling the cursor during the BCI task (reaching a baseline of 160 successful trials), we introduced a VMR to perturb the visual cursor feedback. This was implemented by applying a 30° visuomotor rotation of the cursor’s movement in the fronto-parallel plane. The direction of the rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) varied between days, and the perturbation lasted for a variable number of trials with a maximum of 320 trials. Following the perturbation phase, a washout phase was introduced, during which the visuomotor rotation was removed, and the animals returned to controlling the cursor without any rotation for another variable number of trials until they finished their session for the day. Both animals were housed socially with a single male of the same species at the German Primate Center. The enclosure sizes surpassed the standards required by both German and European regulations. They were kept in a setting enriched with wooden structures, toys, and various other enrichment devices. Neuronal activity was recorded from two macaque monkeys implanted with floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs, MicroProbes, Gaithersburg, USA) in three cortical areas: M1, PMd, and PRR. Monkey Y was implanted with two 32-channel FMAs in each area, while monkey Z was implanted with three 32-channel FMAs in PMd and PRR (see S1C Fig). Both animals were implanted in the left hemisphere, contralateral to the arm used for calibrating the BCI decoder and performing the MC task (S1C Fig). Premotor array positions in monkey Z range between 18.2–25.2 mm AP and 10.5–13.5 mm ML (array centers), and in monkey Y between 18.6–19.6 mm AP and 13.1–17.4 mm ML. M1 array positions in monkey Z range between 14.2–17.2 mm AP and 12.5–14.5 mm ML, and in monkey Y between 10.3–11.6 mm AP 11.9–16.2 mm ML. Parietal array positions in monkey Z range between −1.3 and −6.8 mm AP and 5.5–10.5 mm ML, and in monkey Y between −0.4 and −4.1 mm AP and 8.1–11.9 mm ML. Position data per each array can be found in S1 Fig. The positioning of the premotor arrays aimed at the arm region of PMd. M1 arrays targeted the arm region along different depth in the anterior wall of the central sulcus. Parietal arrays covered the MIP region of the posterior PRR with the longer electrodes, while the shorter electrodes sample from closer to the surface and may partially include area 5 (also referred to as area PEc). In single-day sessions, we recorded from 128 electrodes simultaneously in monkey Y, while we recorded from all 256 electrodes in monkey Z. Activity was recorded online and stored on a hard drive using a 128-channel Cerebus system (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) for monkey Y and two 128-channel Cerebus systems for monkey Z. Data were sampled at 30 kHz. Signals were band-pass filtered (250 Hz–7.5 kHz), and a threshold of −4.5 times the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage was used to isolate below-threshold waveforms. Before the start of each daily experimental session, manual online sorting was performed by an expert user. Sorting involved identification of clusters in PC space to classify neuronal activity based on waveform characteristics. Online neuronal activity during movement was used to train a velocity KF decoder [90] by regressing neuronal firing rates from a subset of single and multi-units with hand velocity (50 ms steps, nonoverlapping time windows) while the monkey manually performed the task during the movement period. During FO decoding a subset of M1 and PMd units where used while during FP decoding subsets of M1 and PMd units were combined with all PRR units. After an initial MC calibration consisting of about 60 trials for initializing KF parameters, the velocity KF decoder was retrained using velocity vectors that directly pointed toward the target [91]. During retraining, first the computer mostly controlled the cursor movement. The computer’s contribution then was step-by-step progressively reduced until real-time neural activity fully guided the cursor. The transition was managed by applying a weighted vectorial sum of both the computer-generated and neural signals, gradually increasing the brain’s control for smoother cursor operation. This adjustment was performed over successive blocks of 20–30 trials, reducing the computer’s contribution from 70% to 0%. The process was not automated and required expert judgment to determine the appropriate timing of the transitions. Additionally, hand movements greater than 15 mm from the resting position were discouraged to prevent the animal from using its hand during BCI trials. This retraining calibration step was necessary to eliminate hand movement during BCI control. We employed the method described by [28] to average trajectories reaching different targets. In brief, trajectories were first projected onto the plane of the applied perturbation (xy—fronto-parallel plane). For each trajectory to a target, the dimension orthogonal to the direction from the center to the specific target was defined as the “perturbation dimension.” This allowed all trajectories to the eight different targets to be averaged within this common reference frame. The positive sign of this second axis was chosen based on the direction of the applied perturbation (clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the session). The online-sorted spikes were re-sorted offline using Boss software (v.1.0.3, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) to better isolate and identify additional units among the noncontrolling units. Units used for online decoding were left unchanged. A threshold of −4.5 times the standard deviation of the noise was used to isolate spikes, with a refractory period of 1.5 ms. Clusters were identified using a semi-automated k-means method in PC space. This semi-automated process required the user to specify the number of clusters and define the initial centroid for each. To study changes in the encoded correction variable during adaptation for noncontrolling units, and during the memory period for all units, we applied a KF decoder offline, similar to the one used for online BCI trials, to reconstruct cursor trajectories. The decoder was always trained on the activity from baseline trials and then applied to the activity from the rotated trials to identify the encoded variable during adaptation. For the evaluation of the decoder during baseline trials, a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was used to include all baseline trials in the analysis. Each time point, sampled every 50 ms and containing all the spikes from each neuron, was used as input to the decoder. For the decoder’s training output, real movement speeds were used during the movement epoch (sampled every 50 ms), while a normalized vector pointing to the cued target was used during the planning epochs (also sampled every 50 ms). This approach allowed us to reconstruct theoretical neural trajectories from the decoded speeds during movement for noncontrolling units and during the memory phase for both controlling and noncontrolling units. We calculated the PC space for each analyzed epoch and region, plotting the variance explained by each dimension (S3 Fig), averaged across the dataset. In the cross-projected analysis of S3A, S3C, S3E, and S3G, we computed the PCs during the movement phase, projected the activity from the memory phase onto the seven PCs, and calculated the explained variance in each specific direction (component). For the alignment index calculation in S3B, S3D, S3F, and S3H Fig, we followed the method of Elsayed and colleagues [62], considering the top four PCs in the transformation. In brief, the alignment index measures manifold alignment and is calculated as the ratio between the explained variance of the projected activity (e.g., during the planning phase) along the original dimensions and the explained variance of the original main dimensions (e.g., derived from movement activity). To calculate the original PC space, we used cross-validated baseline trials to ensure that the alignment index reflects genuine differences between baseline and experimental phases, avoiding artifacts from overfitting. Neuronal contributions were computed from the observation matrix, the rows of which contain the weights linking x, y, z speed to the expected firing rate of neuron. We determined the firing rate of a single cell given the direction of movement using the following equation: We calculated the amplitude of the regressing vector (b1, b2, b3), summed to b0, to estimate the single neuron’s contribution to the decoder, as shown in Fig 4A. This measure provides a single scalar that reflects how much leverage the neuron can exert on the decoded cursor state. We used a linear model to test the significance of the relationship between the planning and movement phases in brain each area, separately for the groups of controlling and noncontrolling units. We also included trial number as variable to model slope changes due to learning and tested the interaction between learning and the planning-movement slope. Different experimental sessions and the two animals were treated as random factors in the model, with a nested hierarchical structure. The Wilkinson notation for the modeled variable was as follows: To calculate slope differences between controlling and noncontrolling populations, as well as between different areas, we employed a similar model that incorporated pairwise-tested interaction effects for the areas being compared. All six pairwise comparisons were corrected for significance using the Bonferroni method (see Fig 5B). The corresponding Wilkinson notation was as follows: Experimental design. This table summarizes, for each recording session, the number of units for each population, the type of decoder used, the rotation angle, and the direction of rotation (clockwise, CW, or counterclockwise, CCW). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.s001 (PDF) Hand movement speed and array implantations.

Monkey Y received six 32-channel floating micro-wire arrays (FMA, MicroProbes for Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, USA) in three distinct brain regions contralateral to the arm used for decoder calibration. Two arrays with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 7.1 to 1.9 mm were implanted in the arm region of the primary motor cortex (M1), two with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 4.5 to 2.1 mm in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and two with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 7.1 to 1.9 mm in the parietal reach region (PRR). Similarly, in Monkey Z, three arrays were implanted in PMd, two in M1, and three in PRR.

Alignment indexes (AI) during various task epochs for planning (left) and movement (right) phases were calculated. The AI was determined by projecting the neural activity from both the early and late adaptation phases onto the principal components (PCs) derived from baseline activity. We selected a sufficient number of PCs to explain 90% of the baseline variance. AI during the baseline was computed using cross-validation. Notably, AI exhibited minimal variation between the baseline and visuomotor rotation (VMR) phases, indicating the preservation of neural manifolds throughout the learning process.

Intel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments. The stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company. Analysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring. Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week. Importantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023. Let’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range. A successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year. Finally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.

Title: The GOOGL Stock Shareholder Jackpot
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/29/the-googl-stock-shareholder-jackpot/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past 10 years, Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has provided an impressive $343 billion to its shareholders through actual cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has accelerated dramatically in 2025, with the stock delivering an exceptional 30% return year-to-date, substantially outperforming the broader market and cementing its position among the year's top-performing mega-cap technology stocks. Alphabet's evolution into a dividend-paying powerhouse reached a milestone this year when the company announced a 5% increase to its quarterly dividend in April 2025, raising the payout to $0.21 per share from the inaugural $0.20 dividend introduced in 2024 - marking the tech giant's transformation from a pure growth story to a balanced capital allocation champion. The company's commitment to rewarding shareholders was further amplified through the authorization of a massive $70 billion share repurchase program in Q1 2025, one of the largest buyback announcements in corporate history, demonstrating management's confidence in the business amid robust financial performance. During the first half of 2025 alone, Alphabet generated impressive revenue growth with Q1 revenues of $90.23 billion (up 12% year-over-year) and Q2 revenues reaching $96.4 billion (up 14% year-over-year), providing the cash flow foundation that enables both aggressive capital returns and continued investment in AI infrastructure and cloud computing expansion. Let’s examine some figures and see how this payout capability compares with the substantial capital-return entities in the market. This provides a solid summary, but assessing a stock from an investment perspective entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to do. It is structured to mitigate stock-specific risks while allowing for potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – Why MSFT Stock Is A Shareholder's Paradise? Why is the shareholder return important? Because dividends and share repurchases constitute direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also demonstrate management’s confidence in the financial health of the company and its ability to generate reliable cash flows. Furthermore, more companies exhibit similar traits. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital delivered back to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. Interestingly, GOOGL ranks 3rd for the highest amount returned to shareholders in history. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What observations can you make? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as META and MSFT are experiencing much faster growth in a more predictable manner compared to others, yet they have provided a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That’s the trade-off associated with substantial capital returns. While they may seem appealing, it's essential to question: Am I compromising growth and solid fundamentals? With that in mind, let's examine GOOGL's performance. (Refer to Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock for further information) Nevertheless, GOOGL is not without the risk of significant declines. It dropped 65% during the Global Financial Crisis, lost roughly 44% in the inflation shock, and encountered a 31% pullback during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even more minor corrections, like in 2018, resulted in a decrease of about 23%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during periods of volatility, even leading stocks can experience turmoil. Also, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Today’s top news: The world’s second-largest asset manager is considering letting its U.S. clients buy crypto ETFs. The final walls are falling down. Last week, Crypto in America reported that Vanguard is weighing access to select spot crypto ETFs for brokerage customers. This is a sharp departure from its 2024 stance, when it blocked spot Bitcoin ETFs on-platform. There’s no final decision or product list yet; the discussions reflect persistent client demand and the competitive reality that most major peers already enable trading. Notably, Vanguard’s CEO Salim Ramji was previously at BlackRock and oversaw the launch of their Bitcoin ETF IBIT, one of the most successful ETF launches of all time. For asset context, Vanguard today oversees ~$10T in AUM and serves more than 50 million investors globally, so even a cautious rollout would be consequential for ETF liquidity. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024.” - source talking to Crypto in America “Vanguard, the 2nd largest asset manager in the world, is finally planning to allow clients to invest in crypto ETFs on their platform. By waiting this long, they have “protected” clients from +150% gains on $BTC since the ETFs went live.” - Satoshi Stacker on X If Vanguard enables crypto ETF access, even with tight guardrails, it adds a massive set of ongoing inflows into crypto majors. That means deeper secondary-market liquidity, broader retirement-account penetration, and more “default” exposure from set-it-and-forget-it investors who previously had to move assets elsewhere. Just 1% of $11T is $110B in inflows (and likely a major up-front portfolio rebalance adjustment). That’s massive. It also marks a symbolic validation: the firm that once said “not appropriate for long-term portfolios” would be acknowledging a durable role for crypto alongside stocks and bonds. The final holdouts are starting to capitulate.

Title: Grab Stock To $4?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Grab Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRAB), Southeast Asia’s foremost super-app for ride-hailing, deliveries, and digital payments, has experienced a surge in 2025, rising approximately 30% year-to-date to around $6.25 per share. However, as investors ponder whether the stock could double, there is another equally significant question: could Grab’s upward momentum diminish and the stock dip back down towards $4? Let’s delve into the argument. If you are searching for upside potential with reduced volatility compared to owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—which is a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns surpassing 91% since its launch. In addition, check out – The Roller Coaster Ride Of Opendoor Stock? Grab reported a gross merchandise value (GMV) of $7.9 billion for 2024, with revenues totaling around $2.2 billion—representing a slower rate than during its early growth phase. While ride-hailing is on the mend, food delivery has moderated, and fintech remains a burden on profits. At a price of $6.25 per share, Grab trades at approximately 3.5x forward sales, which is below that of global competitors like Uber. Nonetheless, if revenue growth continues to float in the mid-single digits and margins stay exceedingly thin, investors may apply a stricter discount. A multiple nearer to 2x sales would suggest a share price close to $4, significantly lower than the current price. The essential insight: Grab doesn’t require a collapse to experience a decline. A slight disappointment in growth or profitability might be enough to recalibrate expectations. At $6.25 per share, Grab has staged a commendable rally in 2025, but the risk of a retraction persists. If growth continues to stabilize and fintech losses accumulate, the stock could regress back towards $4. On the other hand, stronger margin improvements and increased digital banking adoption could validate today’s valuation—or potentially elevate it further. For investors, Grab is still a narrative of substantial potential but also considerable execution risk. At $6.25, the stock reflects a recovery. At $4, it would hint at skepticism about the profitability of the super-app model. Its future trajectory will depend on Grab's ability to turn market dominance into sustainable earning strength. Investors should brace for considerable volatility and the chance of significant losses if market conditions worsen or if the company fails to realize its ambitious growth objectives. While the 2x upside potential is mathematically sound based on projected revenues, it necessitates flawless execution within a rapidly shifting and competitive environment. Now, we implement a risk assessment framework while structuring the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a strong history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks resulted in better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Did Reddit Stock Drop 10%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Reddit stock (NYSE:RDDT) dropped nearly 10% in the past week, in contrast to the nearly stable performance of the S&P 500 Index. The fluctuations in Reddit’s stock price are particularly notable when compared to its competitors, including Meta Platforms – which fell about 3% during the week, Snap – gaining around 8%, and Pinterest – which dropped approximately 3%. The decline is indicative of investor worries regarding slower user growth and possible traffic challenges related to updates in Google’s search algorithms and AI-generated responses, which may impact engagement and advertising capacity on the platform. With the current share price hovering around $237, we believe Reddit could experience short-term challenges before stabilizing. Importantly, the stock is still significantly higher compared to its IPO valuation from early 2024 and has increased by 45% since late 2024, as outlined in our analysis of Why Reddit Stock Moved. However, for those looking for growth with less volatility than owning a single stock, the High Quality Portfolio is worth considering. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark, which consists of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns of over 91% since its launch. As a whole, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, don’t miss – Uber Stock To $200? Some of the increase in Reddit’s stock since its IPO can be attributed to the approximately 30% rise in its revenues from 2022 to 2024. Revenue growth surged in 2023 due to the introduction of new ad products and licensing agreements, and this trend continued into 2024 with ongoing growth in advertising and AI-related data licensing. Nevertheless, growth started to slow somewhat in early 2025 amid worries regarding traffic sources and user engagement patterns. Although Reddit has experienced steady revenue growth, its PS multiple has not broadened significantly. The company's PS multiple rose from around 10x in 2024 to almost 12x by mid-2025. While the company’s PS is currently above historical averages, there may be potential downside when comparing the current multiple to previous peaks – roughly 15x in late 2024 and closer to 9x as recently as early 2023. In its latest quarter, Reddit declared revenue of approximately $240 million, reflecting an increase of more than 20% year-over-year, and recorded its second quarterly profit since its IPO. However, the daily active users count of 100 million was slightly under optimistic forecasts, raising concerns about market saturation and competition. For the full year of 2025, Reddit has projected revenue growth in the mid-20% range, but remarks regarding traffic uncertainty have made investors cautious. If the company can demonstrate resilience in user engagement and continue to enhance its ad products, the stock could potentially regain its upward trajectory. However, in the short term, volatility is expected to remain as investors weigh high valuation multiples against execution risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark inclusive of all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap — and has generated returns above 91% since its inception.

Title: Is Vanguard Coming Around to Crypto ETFs?

The company is reportedly considering adding third-party products to its brokerage,, but Vanguard said it hasn’t made any decisions. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Changing your mind is hard, but it’s a sign of maturity and openness to new information… Especially, when there’s money to be made. Vanguard appears to be reevaluating its stance on crypto ETFs, which the financial giant famously has not allowed on its brokerage. That’s according to industry newsletter Crypto in America, which cited an anonymous source familiar with the company’s plans. The potential change follows demands from clients for access to crypto ETFs and developments at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which has dramatically changed its stance on crypto, the publication noted. Vanguard indicated an openness to adding products in a statement to ETF Upside, a significant change in posture, but neither confirmed nor denied the report. “Today, cryptocurrency mutual funds and ETFs are generally not available for purchase on the Vanguard brokerage platform, but we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences and the evolving regulatory environment,” a spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” It’s notable that Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji came from BlackRock, where he oversaw the introduction of numerous iShares ETFs to the market, including the biggest crypto exchange-traded product on the planet, the now $84 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. While Ramji last year said that Vanguard did not have plans to pursue its own crypto ETFs, he was less dismissive of adding third-party products on the brokerage side, Crypto in America wrote. Vanguard has several potential routes to adding access to crypto, according to Jeff DeMaso, editor of the Independent Vanguard Adviser: Fool’s Gold? It’s an easier argument for Vanguard to walk back its stance on excluding crypto ETFs from the brokerage than it would be for the firm to reconsider crypto products of its own, DeMaso said. And part of that is the company’s view on crypto, such as whether it buys into the idea that Bitcoin is digital gold. “If it’s gold 2.0, well, Vanguard lets you buy gold ETFs (like GLD), so why not allow bitcoin ETFs?” The ETF strategy lets wealthy investors defer, or even avoid, capital gains tax liabilities. Man Group is the latest to join the ETF bonanza, and it’s far from alone. The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. Competing theories have been proposed to explain why billions of dollars have gone into and out of several ARK ETFs in recent weeks. The Federal Reserve’s decision may not have been a surprise, but ripple effects are already being felt across the industry. Generic listing standards for crypto exchange-traded products could open the floodgates for ETPs beyond spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Even BlackRock’s IBIT, a usually strong performer, wasn’t spared, shedding $37.3 million. They faced $795.6M redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH led with $362M outflows, while BlackRock’s ETHA saw $199.9M. Only ETHE and TETH gained. After weeks of strong momentum in the ETF market, the tide has turned. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. saw a sharp reversal last week, recording over $1.7 billion in combined outflows. The exodus came as both cryptocurrencies faced heightened volatility, with Bitcoin and Ethereum each sliding more than 8% over the same period. According to data from Farside Investors, U.S.-listed Spot Bitcoin ETFs logged net withdrawals of $903 million last week. This ended a month-long streak of inflows that had signaled rising institutional confidence. On the 26th of September, Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus with $330.4 million in redemptions, followed by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB and other funds. BlackRock’s flagship IBIT, typically regarded as one of the strongest performers, also saw outflows worth $37.3 million, while Bitwise’s BITB shed $23.8 million. Several other funds reported smaller redemptions, while a few remained flat with no notable flows. On the other hand, for the week ending the 26th of September, nine U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs collectively saw $795.6 million in withdrawals, marking their heaviest week of outflows since their launch. Fidelity’s FETH once again stood out for recording the largest withdrawals at $362 million, trailed by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw $199.9 million in redemptions. Grayscale’s ETHE and 21Shares’ TETH were rare exceptions, posting modest inflows while most other funds stagnated. With this shift in investor sentiment, attention is now shifting toward altcoin ETFs, with several final deadlines for approval arriving in October. Popular analyst Daan Crypto Trades even described October as “ETF month,” hinting at a potentially decisive moment for the broader digital asset ETF market. He said, “We’re expected to see approvals on ETFs from a variety of major altcoins like $SOL, $XRP, $LTC & $DOGE.” Daan Crypto Trades noted that none of the ETF applications with October deadlines come from industry heavyweights like Fidelity or BlackRock, two of the most influential players in the crypto ETF arena. Still, the pending approvals could inject fresh momentum into the market in the weeks ahead. Interestingly, this wave of outflows came even as institutional appetite for Bitcoin ETFs remained evident. Just last week, Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $642.4 million in inflows, according to Farside Investors. The broader landscape has also seen Wall Street deepening its crypto ties, with JPMorgan in June 2025 starting to accept Bitcoin ETF shares as collateral for loans. Together, these developments highlight the mixed signals in today’s ETF market: short-term volatility shadowed by long-term institutional integration.

This is Naked Capitalism fundraising week. 291 donors have already invested in our efforts to combat corruption and predatory conduct, particularly in the financial realm. Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal. Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting the comments section. While the Trump administration’s recent $100,000 fee for H1-B visas have received the lion’s share of the attention due to potential effects in the tech and healthcare fields, there was a recent policy change for lowly agricultural guest workers that shows how the administration’s immigrant worker plan is coming full circle. As we predicted, after targeting humanitarian parole, temporary protected status, and other immigrant workers, the administration is now relaxing rules for H2-A “guest workers,” a program which has been called “close to slavery.” Back in July, the administration put in place stringent in-person interview requirements for a wide range of visa holders and applicants. Only two months later, they are lifting the requirement for guest agricultural workers. Now, this could simply be an admission of error by the administration which is getting complaints about crops rotting and realizing it made a mistake. It’s more likely this was the plan as it’s what workers have been warning against and such a move fits with Trump’s priors. Are H2-B workers—those “guest” laborers in non-agricultural fields that Trump’s businesses rely on—next to be waved on in by the administration? That, too, looks increasingly likely. Key to understanding this mega project of workforce engineering by the administration is understanding who is being targeted by ICE, deported, and who is being waved into the US while others encounter roadblocks. Let’s take a look. Who Among the Immigrant Workforce Is Being Targeted for Removal About 40 percent of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented. Here’s how the makeup looks: As of 2020 there were more than 406,000 individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to reside and work legally in the US due to unsafe conditions in their home country—usually with an assist from US interference ala regime change efforts or direct military involvement. The similar humanitarian parole covered another 530,000-plus. According to FERN: Another 1.7 million people work in food processing plants, per the USDA. Many are refugees, and approximately 19% are in the country without authorization, according to the New American Economy research group. In the largest food processing segment, meatpacking, the American Immigration Council estimates that 45% of all workers are immigrants and around 23% are unauthorized. While the administration goes after the unauthorized, It is also trying to get rid of TPS and humanitarian parole. Trump suspended all refugee resettlement programs via executive order save for white South African “refugees.” The Department of Homeland Security also removed Afghanistan and Venezuela from the TPS list and is trying to axe Haiti as well. That means more than 9,000 Afghan, 300,000 Venezuelan, and 200,000 Haitians in the US can be legally deported. There is a heavy concentration of TPS holders in the meatpacking industry. As of 2020, roughly 15,600 worked on farms or in food processing.The United Food & Commercial Workers union warned months ago that deportations or threats of deporation could lead to the meat shortages and price increases that we currently seeing (although there are other factors). From Investigate Midwest: Increased immigration enforcement has scared many immigrants—legal or not– into staying home after the Supreme Court allowed ICE to target people based on skin color For example, in Beardstown, Illinois, many workers at the meat processing plant were legally in the U.S. under humanitarian parole programs, but the Trump administration revoked their status. At first the administration said it was going after people with criminal records rather than conduct mass workplace raids. But there was no way that path was going to get to the stated goal of 1 million deportations by the end of the year. And so food production sites became a prime target. Yes, these raids target unauthorized immigrants. They also set back the country’s food system. Designed to Fail Recall that the administration’s plan was based not only on getting rid of workers who had built lives in the US, many of whom were trying to improve their lot through unionization efforts, but also snatching Medicaid away from all the loafers out there. This was going to somehow magically get Americans out into the fields and into the slaughterhouses despite all the evidence to the contrary. Here’s Scott Morgenstern, a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has predicted that farm owners will soon find plenty of U.S. citizens to employ. She declared on July 8 that the new Medicaid work requirements included in the same legislative package as the immigration enforcement funds would encourage huge numbers of U.S. citizens to start working in the fields instead of losing their health insurance through that government program. Farm trade groups say this scenario is far-fetched. For one thing, most adults enrolled in the Medicaid program who can work already do. Many others are unable to do so due to disabilities or caregiving obligations. Few people enrolled in Medicaid live close enough to a farm to work at one, and even those who do aren’t capable of doing farmwork. When farm owners tried putting people enrolled in a welfare program to work in the fields in the 1990s, it failed. Another experiment in the 1960s, which deployed teenagers, didn’t pan out either because the teens found the work too hard. Notably one strategy not employed by the administration is requiring higher wages and improved worker conditions. And so unsurprisingly federal labor data shows a 7% drop in the US agriculture workforce between March and July, equal to roughly 155,000 workers. Predictably, the Trump administration is turning to H2-A guest workers. In June, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the creation of the Office of Immigration Policy, which the labor secretary said will be a “one-stop shop” to help employers meet their labor needs.. And then on September 18, the State Department declared that H2-A visa holders no long must attend an in-person interview to renew their visas within 12 months of the expiration of their old one. It wouldn’t be surprising if H2-B workers are next to be waved in, perhaps based on slaughterhouse worker shortages, but also beneficial for people like Trump who employs the guest workers at his properties. Industry “stakeholders” are applauding the H2-A move, and they are asking for more—particularly longer term work permits, which are still tied to an individual’s labor and mean the employer has near complete control over the worker. In effect what’s happening is a trading out of people for exploitable workers. In the tech world, the AI bubble might be an avalanche of slop, but is useful in another way. Take Amazon, which claimed AI was taking jobs when it conducted mass layoffs only to turn around and replace those workers with cheaper H1-B alternatives. In the case of the agriculture and service sector industries, we have the government doing the heavy lifting removing immigrants and refugeesn who aren’t exploitable enough and replacing them with H2-A and H2-B alternatives. Why Capital Loves Guest Workers A crucial difference between the migrant H-2B and H-2A workers and immigrants who live and work in the US under temporary protected status or humanitarian parole is that the latter two categories didn’t have their ability to stay in the country legally tied to their work. That made them less exploitable. They were free to change jobs and unionize. That’s probably a big reason they’re being targeted for deportation. Trump has suggested that unauthorized immigrants and refugees who had built lives in the US could potentially return legally, but the administration has not provided specifics. It’s pretty clear what he means. Edgar Franks, the political director of Familias Unidas, summed it up in April—an assessment that is now shared by the likes of the AFL-CIO’s Department of People Who Work for a Living and other unions: It was meant to silence the organizing, deport as many people as possible, and to bring in a captive workforce through the H-2A program. We think that might be the ultimate plan: to get rid of all the immigrant workers who are organizing and fighting back for better conditions, and to bring in a workforce that’s under the complete control of their employer with basically no rights. Franks prediction is steadily being realized. And to back up his claim, it’s pretty remarkable how efficiently ICE and the administration target unauthorized or refugee workers who are unionized or organizing. Some examples: The United Farm Workers labor union has condemned the raid at the farm that the UFW has been actively organizing in since 2022. Of the 14 workers detained at the May 2 raid, ten were ultimately deported. UFW Secretary Treasurer Armando Elenes labels the raids as “shameful employer complicity in the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate legal protections and lower wages for farm workers.” “A legally-binding union contract has already been awarded at Lynn-Ette by a NY State-appointed arbitrator, yet Lynn-Ette is defying the law and refusing to implement this union contract,” states Elenes. As of 2024 there were 384,900 H2-A and 215,217 H2-B workers in the US—numbers that have been steadily increasing for decades and especially over the past 15 years with a more than fivefold increase since 2010. With the administration’s early moves, this number is set to increase even further. In theory, the foreign workers who obtain H-2A visas are supposed to be guaranteed relatively high wages, as well as housing in the U.S. In reality, it is not enforced, and they are left to the whims of their employers. Because they are basically indentured servants they are loved by Trump and many employers. Even the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security “acknowledge that H-2B workers face structural disincentives to reporting or leaving abusive conditions, and often lack power to exercise their rights in the face of exploitative employment situations.” The Food & Environment Reporting Network with more: …these visas are notoriously abusive to foreign workers. That’s because they effectively create a captive workforce: In contrast to other immigrant workers in the U.S. — including recipients of certain humanitarian programs, like TPS — H-2 workers’ presence in the country is tied to a particular job and employer. H-2 employees are eligible to work for whoever sponsors their visa, and it can be prohibitively difficult for them to switch jobs even if they’re mistreated. If they quit, they’re sent back to their home countries, which would ruin many H-2 workers and their families financially. (Over half of all H-2A farmworkers enter the country in debt to illegal recruiters, who charge fees for connecting workers with job contracts.) H2-A guest workers also faced a major setback in their fight to organize last year when a District Court Judge issued an injunction in August that blocked them from unionizing in 17 states. The guest worker program also features labor trafficking, rampant wage fraud, illegal recruitment fees, wage theft, and illegal threats of retaliation. Abuse is made easy by the fact that it’s almost impossible for workers to quit their jobs since their visas are tied to a single employer. Mike Rios, a DOL regional agricultural enforcement coordinator, describes the H2 program as the “literal purchase of humans.” But it’s not just the guest workers who suffer. Pain (Nearly) All Around The guest worker program might be beneficial for individual employers, but it is drain for American society. From Investigate Midwest: Undocumented immigrants paid $100 billion in taxes in 2022, without enjoying any of the benefits, such as Social Security or Medicare. Living in communities, they also contribute to local economies. Temporary visa workers, on the other hand, send most of the money they earn to their home countries. It’s also bad for all workers, including those those Americans who were supposed to take the place of immigrants and refugees. The Food & Environment Reporting Network: H-2 workers have so little bargaining power that some employers prefer to hire them over U.S. citizens — which ends up disenfranchising the American-born workers Trump and Miller say their deportations will benefit. Under federal law, employers must show they were unable to hire American workers before they’re approved to hire H-2 workers, but some employers circumvent that rule and commit visa fraud to avoid hiring Americans at higher rates. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has filed a string of complaints with the DOL, alleging that meatpacking companies have repeatedly requested increased allocations of H-2B workers as a way of undercutting wages. What about all those workers who have lived and labored here for years and in some cases decades? There’s a reason that immigration question was never settled as described here by Michael Macher: …the US immigration system runs not on the enforcement of immigration laws, but on their selective nonenforcement. Employers have relied on the state to ignore the exploitation of undocumented labor while holding the credible threat of deportation over workers. This has had the effect of strengthening employer bargaining power generally against all workers—lowering wages, weakening unions, and shifting the politics of work away from collective bargaining and wage-and-hour regulation. The interest in labor that is weak and disorganized has driven US politicians, consciously or not, to adopt the role of petty bosses, threatening the deportation of significant portions of the US workforce. Trump might be in the process of blowing up that system by turning the role of petty bosses back to the actual bosses, and he’s able to do that now because labor is so weakened after a half century of losses in the class war. Even the crumbs are now being snatched away. Weak—and in some cases counterproductive from a labor viewpoint—agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are being further crippled. And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” That means that as of now any effort from workers and unions to fight back, such as “illegal” strikes, can now be labeled “anti-capitalist” and the weight of the police state will come crashing down on them. Public sector unions are already in retreat. Immigrants who were part of communities, and in many cases unions, are being shown the door only to be replaced by indentured servants often housed away from society in squalid prison-like housing. Trump is dutifully playing his role as an accelerant and looking to make a bad program worse: The Biden administration changed the methodology for calculating the rate for H-2A workers, which resulted in a larger pay increase for some of them this year. Some farm organizations, including the NCAE and the Farm Bureau, want the Trump administration to roll back that change and expand the H-2A program to cover year-round workers, especially for dairy and livestock farms. During Trump’s first term the temporary work visa programs steadily grew a total of 13 percent larger, and he used the Covid emergency to help make it happen: During the pandemic, his administration issued a series of emergency measures that made H-2A and H-2B visas more flexible and employer-friendly. Workers were allowed to stay in the country for longer periods of time, in part because they had been deemed “essential workers,” and wages for H-2A workers were effectively frozen. Trump 2.0 is using a crisis of its own creation in order to strengthen the guest worker program and hammer all of labor. Rather than better pay and working conditions to entice American workers, we’re getting an increase in guest workers to further drive down wages and worker protections. The house of labor, which has been burning for decades, is now being doused with Trump gasoline. And the capital-labor arrangement being steadily reinforced looks for Americans a lot like the immigrant experience. All workers must sell their labor for pennies on the dollar, accept unsafe conditions, and any other types of abuse or, in the case of immigrants, face deportation to foreign prisons. For Americans, the risk is becoming homeless and tossed into US (private) prisons. And with “anti-capitalist” beliefs now labeled as terrorism, workers face even more hurdles fighting back. Indentures and serfdom. Trump et al appear nostalgic for the days of proto-capitalism when the employer (lord of the manor) had near absolute power. It also brings to mind the Dickensian “dark satanic mill era” when wages were as close to starvation level as possible. But what is one to do? That’s capitalism in its purest form and who wants to be an Anti-capitalist in the US of A? Or maybe it’s just nostalgia for the Grapes of Wrath era which was less than 100 years ago. FDR may have sanded the rough edges off industrial capitalism but Big Ag has always had special power out in the heartland. And now we have Big Tech that also loves them some unskilled labor for their warehouses–picking products rather than vegetables. The solution to the immigration problem is simple. Employers should be required to pay foreign workers the same wages and benefits as American workers. Throughout history, immigrants have been welcomed not because ordinary citizens are tolerant but because capitalists have viewed them as a source of cheap labor. The H2a program has a higher wage floor built in – the adverse effect wage. Farms that employ H2a workers in my region often have higher pay than non-H2a employers. However, because farmers already feel like they are overpaying their guest workers, work and housing conditions suffer. B2S Workers want these jobs badly, and are willing to put up with a good amount of abuse in order to keep them, and given their lack of agency in the recruitment process, workers fear the next farm could be much worse. The Somalian and Cambodian refugees I have worked with have had the ability to quit and find new jobs. Not so for the Jamaican H2a workers. The importance of this factor in incentivizing farmers in improving work conditions cannot be overlooked. I await your silent empire, Tristero. Although in this curious instance, the foreigners were paid more. But the abusive conditions are present. Black Farmworkers Say They Lost Jobs to Foreigners Who Were Paid More (NY Times via archive.ph) From 2021 The reliance on South Africans may reflect the nature of agriculture and the demographics in the Mississippi Delta, compared with places like California. “In the Mississippi Delta, row-crop production requires fewer workers but workers who have skills to use machinery and equipment,” said Elizabeth Canales, an agricultural extension economist at Mississippi State University. “We hardly have any Latinos in this remote region. Naturally, it’s easier to hire South Africans where language will not be a barrier, especially because in this area, you have a very small Spanish-speaking population.” The South Africans arrived in the region willing to work weeks that sometimes stretched to 75 hours or more, grueling schedules that might have been difficult for older local workers to maintain, industry analysts said. “And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” Chris Hedges latest explains in detail what Trump’s directive will mean to you and me: https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/trumps-war-on-america A narrow slice of the H1-B program earns the ire of many. If jobs are narrowly posted so they are hidden from domestic workers and targeted toward foreign workers, there are some inequities. Domestic people get shafted, having to train their replacements, notoriously in IT, and foreigners may get jobs but at the costs noted of passport confiscation, abuse and other ills. Transparency would help. My opinion is that H-1B and Students were targeted because many become Pro Palestinian. May not even be Trump per say, but by those who control Congress Nip it in the bud as they say Thanks Conor! All the news is about ICE, harsh immigration crackdowns, and deportations to 3rd world hell holes. Very little news on H-2B visas, and virtually no news on H-2A visas, i.e. the real reason for the immigration crackdown. Labor organization, strikes, and any sort of anti capitalism protests are now considered gateway to terrorism activities that get you on a terrorism watchlist. Alligator Alcatraz and other US prison sites being built. Republican senators and members of congress silent and in hiding from their base. The Democrats have Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries leading their base in a silent and peaceful march into economic bondage. And the MAGA base continues to wear their “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” hats in blissful ignorance over the fact that they’ve been played bigtime. Only in America, the richest country ever, where the 1% still do not have enough to fill the bottomless pit in their collective souls, could this happen. Your email address will not be published.

AI giant Anthropic is facing a possible head-on collision with the Trump administration — as concerns from conservatives multiply that the fast-growing firm carries a left-wing bias, The Post has learned. Investors in the San Francisco-based company — known for its popular Claude chatbot — include the Ford Foundation, a notoriously left-leaning group that bought $5 million worth of Anthropic shares in March 2024 in the bankruptcy of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, according to little-noticed court filings. Earlier this month, Vice President JD Vance called out the Ford Foundation by name while vowing to “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That’s after Anthropic recently irritated Trump officials by barring federal contractors from using its tools for some law enforcement purposes. Some at the White House have grumbled that Anthropic, whose CEO Dario Amodei is a prominent Democratic donor, could be “selectively enforcing its policies” due to differing political views, Semafor reported. Taken together, the two data points are likely to invite unwelcome scrutiny for Anthropic — even as rivals including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI have worked to curry favor with the White House, a source close to the Trump administration said. “When [the White House] is looking for a collaborative partner and suddenly they start being obstinate over White House objectives, and it comes to surface that they got a significant investment from a hostile political organization – which is what I would consider the Ford Foundation to be – I think you’re going to see a lot of eyebrows being raised,” the source added. Anthropic, whose backers include Amazon and Google, is competing with OpenAI, xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta for everything from lucrative federal contracts to crafting potential federal regulations around AI. But even before the latest flap over AI usage by federal contractors, Anthropic’s relationship with the White House – and key administration officials like AI czar David Sacks – was already seen as shaky at best. Anthropic’s Amodei called Trump a “feudal warlord” in a now-deleted social media post expressing support for Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. In 2018, he described Trump as a “serious and legitimate threat to the rule of law.” During a May episode of the popular “All In” podcast, Sacks said Anthropic was part of group of tech “doomers” that he described as “committed leftists” and “Trump haters” with ties to the effective altruism movement, which once counted Bankman-Fried among its elite backers. Sacks also pointed out that several ex-Biden administration staffers had joined Anthropic and that Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, a Democratic megadonor, was part of its board of directors. Amodei was one of the few tech honchos who skipped Trump’s inauguration in January, though he did attend an administration event about energy policy in Pittsburgh in July. He has also raised the hackles of some AI leaders with frequent warnings about the technology’s risks. Amodei has said executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur due to AI and suggested unemployment could hit 20%. He’s also warned of a 25% chance that things go “really, really badly” for humanity as AI gets more advanced. Daniela Amodei, his sister and a fellow co-founder of Anthropic, has a long history of donating to Democrats, include Harris, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. “When it comes to policy and trying to foment the golden age of American economic dominance, the White House is looking for partners who want to put America first and want to work together collaboratively,” the source close to the White House added. Despite its differences with the administration, Anthropic has secured a number of federal contracts – including a $200 million contract with the Department of War and a partnership with the US General Services Administration. Anthropic has also expressed support for the White House’s AI Action Plan, declaring it was “encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Anthropic’s valuation was just $18.4 billion in early 2024. But as of earlier this month, Anthropic had secured an $183 billion post-money valuation. Depending on the share structure, that means Ford Foundation’s stake, while tiny compared to key backers like Google and Amazon, has seen a huge increase in value over the last year. An Anthropic spokesperson said the Ford Foundation represents a small fraction of the firm’s overall investor base. Ford does not have any influence over Anthropic’s policy positions or business activities, the spokesperson added. “We are committed to protecting America’s lead in AI, defending and upholding America’s democratic values, and contesting the advance of authoritarian adversaries,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “As part of that commitment, Anthropic was an early mover in deploying AI for national security and intelligence work, and we work with the intelligence community in many different capacities.” The spokesperson also pushed back on the notion that Anthropic has a rift with the Trump administration. While Anthropic’s policies bar the use of its AI tools for “direct domestic surveillance and related collection of data,” multiple federal law enforcement agencies “are currently using Claude for research, analysis, and other use cases.” Other AI giants, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Google, have policies restricting use of their AI tools for surveillance purposes. A Ford Foundation spokesperson said: “Like any other passive investor in a company, the Ford Foundation has no role in Anthropic’s management or business activities.” Vance, who co-hosted an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” after the assassination, alleged that the Ford Foundation and the George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations had provided funding to progressive magazine The Nation. The vice president slammed the outlet for misrepresenting Kirk’s words in an article titled “Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning.” In response, Open Society said it never funded The Nation, while Ford Foundation said it hasn’t funded the outlet since 2019. The allegation was part of a larger pledge by Vance to target progressive groups that he accused of stoking a rise of left-wing violence. Advertisement

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Experiment is the only means of knowledge at our disposal. Everything else is poetry, imagination.”— Max Planck Number of the Week: Less than 10% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on the EPA Endangerment Finding by Richard Lindzen and William Happer. TWTW continues with a geological paper by Leszek Mark who asserts that the current warming is largely part of a natural cycle. Then TWTW discusses an assertion in the Wall Street Journal that human emissions of carbon dioxide have made the oceans too acidic to be considered healthy. ********************* EPA Endangerment Finding: On September 22, Richard Lindzen, Professor of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Emeritus, MIT, and William Happer, Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Princeton University, submitted their comments to Administrator Lee Zeldin of the US EPA on the reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. The highly accomplished forty-plus-page document is full of scientific evidence contradicting the Endangerment Finding. TWTW cannot adequately summarize it here but will cite some sections that may be of particular interest with the footnotes omitted. After thanking Administrator Zeldin for the opportunity to comment, the opening page states: We are career physicists with a special expertise in radiation physics, which describes how carbon dioxide and other GHGs affect heat flow in Earth’s atmosphere. We are both members of the National Academy of Sciences. Our CVs are attached. Our comment focuses on your request for comments as to, “The scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are weaker than previously believed and contradicted by empirical data, peer-reviewed studies, and scientific developments since 2009 (C-2).” In our scientific opinion, the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding (“EF”) are fatally flawed science, for two key reasons. • It fails to consider contradictory science. • It is not based on science; it is based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Scientific details follow.” After giving a table of contents, the Introduction states: “The EPA Endangerment Finding is: ‘[T]he Administrator finds that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare. Specifically, the Administrator is defining the ‘air pollution’ referred to in CAA section 202(a) to be the mix of six long-lived and directly-emitted greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).’ * * * ‘The Administrator has considered how elevated concentrations of the well-mixed greenhouse gases and associated climate change affect public health by evaluating the risks associated with changes in air quality, increases in temperatures, changes in extreme weather events, increases in food- and waterborne pathogens, and changes in aeroallergens.’ 74 FR 66,497. At the outset it is important to understand that carbon dioxide has two relevant properties, as a creator of food and oxygen, and as a greenhouse gas (GHG). As to food and oxygen, carbon dioxide is essential to nearly all life on earth by creating food and oxygen by photosynthesis. Further, it creates more food as its level in the atmosphere increases. For example, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature. As to carbon dioxide as a GHG, the Endangerment Finding is premised on the Net Zero Theory that carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions must be reduced to Net Zero and the use of fossil fuels must be eliminated by 2050 to avoid catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. A key premise the EPA has asserted is, ‘The increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere and the resulting warming have led to more frequent and more intense heat waves and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and retreating snow and ice.’ Further, a foundational premise of everything the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does is that the ‘evidence is clear that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change,’ where ‘main driver means responsible for more than 50% of the change.’ We demonstrate that the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding and of both the EPA and IPCC premises are fatally flawed science, for two key separate and combined reasons: First, both fail to consider contradictory science, including: Second, both are not based on science, and are based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and, furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Frankly, we also demonstrate that the Endangerment Finding is a classic example of what Peter Drucker described as government subordinating science to ‘value-judgments that are the reverse of, and largely incompatible with, any criteria one could possibly call scientific.’ Further, our opinion is that science requires urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march. Scientific details follow.” The comment then goes into a discussion of what is and what is not, science, which TWTW has presented in previous comments by Lindzen and Happer. Section III “The Endangerment Finding Failed to Consider Contradictory Science” begins with: The Endangerment Finding states: ‘The scientific evidence is compelling that elevated concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are the root cause of recently observed climate change. The IPCC conclusion from 2007 has been re-confirmed by the June 2009 USGCRP assessment that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.’ 74 FR 66,518 (footnote deleted). As a matter of physics, the scientific evidence cited by the Endangerment Finding from two government organizations, the IPCC and USGCRP, is false science. (Elaborated in section III.B and D).” [These sections are not presented in this TWTW.] “The five most abundant GHGs are water vapor (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and methane (CH4). Water vapor and clouds account “for more than 90% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.’ Thus, CO2 and all the other GHGs account for less than 10% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat and warm the planet. The Endangerment Finding cites six GHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 FR 66,516. The warming effects of methane and nitrous oxide are also so small that they are irrelevant to climate, as are the latter three. The physics of carbon dioxide and other GHGs is that they lose their capacity to warm the planet as their concentration in the atmosphere increases because of what is called “saturation,” and according to logarithmic equations. Every doubling of CO2 causes a warming of less than 1° C, to first approximation, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The other GHGs cause only a small fraction of the warming from CO2. Focusing on the physics of CO2, it becomes a less effective greenhouse gas at higher concentrations.” Then the comment gives a chart which may be confusing without more explanation and then continues with: “Most importantly, at today’s CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of approximately 425 parts per million and higher, saturation means that CO2 has little ability to absorb heat and warm the planet. Because of saturation, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). Saturation means that from now on, CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and other sources will have little impact on global warming. Since CO2 at today’s level is “saturated,” for this reason alone there is no risk that the continued use of fossil fuels will cause catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. Moreover, the mathematics of logarithms can also be applied to temperature increases since the beginning of the Industrial Age in 1750 when carbon dioxide levels were about 280 ppm. Doubling it to 560 ppm would also only cause a trivial increase in temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The increase in temperature would be even less, and trivial, if carbon dioxide increased from the beginning of the Industrial Age at 280 ppm to today’s 425 ppm, a much smaller increase of 145 ppm than doubling it to 560 ppm. Saturation also explains why temperatures were not catastrophically high over the hundreds of millions of years when CO2 levels were 10 to nearly 20 times higher than they are today, shown in the chart in Part III.C covering 600 million years.” [Part II C is not discussed in this TWTW.] “More specifically, the physics of how changes in atmospheric GHGs affect radiation transfer are described by precise physical equations that have never failed to describe observations. We and Prof. van Wijngaarden applied these formulas to the enormous efforts by the U. S. and worldwide to reduce CO2 emissions to Net Zero by 2050 in a paper that we recommend to those with a technical background.” The comment then discusses US going to net zero carbon dioxide emissions will have a miniscule effect on temperatures. It discusses the difference between the smooth Planck Curve of Earth’s blackbody radiation and the jagged curve of Earth’s radiation to space. The jagged curve identifies the frequencies associated with specific greenhouse gases. This section then concludes with: “Finally, note that CO2 is not nearly as potent a greenhouse gas as water vapor and clouds (especially cirrus clouds). A radiation-blocking effect of only about 3 W/m2 could easily also be produced by changes in the size or height of cloud cover on any given day. This is a complex system, and the idea that one variable, globally average temperature, is changed primarily by one thing, manmade CO2, is baseless. As one of us (Lindzen) has explained: ‘The climate system consists of two turbulent fluids interacting with each other, [ocean and atmosphere]. They are on a rotating planet that is differentially heated by the sun. A vital constituent of the atmospheric component is water in the liquid, solid, and vapor phases, and the changes in phase have vast energetic ramifications. The energy budget of this system involves the absorption and remission of about 200 watts per square meter. Doubling CO2 involves a two percent perturbation to this budget. So do minor changes in clouds, ocean circulations, and other features, and such changes are common. In this complex multifactor system, what is the likelihood that the climate (which itself consists of many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomalies) is controlled by a two percent perturbation in the energy budget due to just one of the numerous variables, namely CO2? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic.’ In conclusion, since CO2 at today’s level is ‘saturated,’ and the warming effects of the other GHGs are so small they are irrelevant to climate, physics demonstrates: Physics demonstrates there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding. For this reason alone, the Endangerment Finding should be repealed.” In the interests of brevity, this TWTW skips over a great deal of important scientific and other arguments to go to the last section citing an important Supreme Court decision and the Conclusion which state [Individual words in boldface were in italics in original]: “V. The Endangerment Finding Is Arbitrary, Capricious, and thus Invalided Under the Supreme Court’s State Farm Decision. As a legal matter, we understand State Farm is a key Supreme Court case that ruled that an agency regulation is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid where, inter alia: The Endangerment Finding fails each of these State Farm mandates: First, Unscientific Evidence. Unscientific evidence, misrepresented as science, is all the EPA provided underlying the Endangerment Finding, demonstrated in Part IV. Congress never intended for the EPA to consider and rely on unscientific evidence in making its Endangerment Finding, as it did. Second, Contradictory Scientific Evidence Ignored. The Endangerment Finding ignored and “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” the robust and reliable contradictory scientific evidence detailed above in Part III. Therefore, the Endangerment Finding is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid for either or both reasons under State Farm. CONCLUSION Accordingly, we demonstrated the Endangerment Finding is based on fatally flawed science, for two reasons: First, it fails to consider contradictory science, including:. Second, it is not based on science, it is based on unscientific sources. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Finally, we repeat, urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it is required because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march.” TWTW comment: It will be very interesting to see how the lower courts treat scientific argument, based on physical evidence, given the Supreme Court’s State Farm decision in 1983 “Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).

It states that the current warming is part of a natural cycle that has been going on throughout the Holocene (starting about 11,700 years ago). The present warm interglacial epoch in the Quaternary period (starting about 2.6 million years ago) features prolonged glacial periods (Ice Ages). The abstract of the paper states: “Cyclical climate change is characteristic of the Holocene, with successive warmings and coolings. A solar forcing mechanism has steered Holocene climate change, expressed by 9 cooling phases known as Bond events. There is reliable geological evidence that the temperatures of most warming phases in the Holocene were globally higher or similar to that of the current warming period, Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers in the northern hemisphere either disappeared or were smaller. During the African Humid Period in the Early and Middle Holocene, much stronger summer monsoons made the Sahara green with growth of savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The modern warming is part of a climatic cycle with a progressive warming after the Little Ice Age, the last cold episode of which occurred at the beginning of the 19th century. Successive climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are based on the assumption that the modern temperature rise is steered exclusively by the increasing content of human-induced CO2 in the atmosphere. If compared with the observational data, these projected temperatures have been highly overestimated.” As climate fluctuations, Bond events are similar to Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, except Bond events are noted in the current warm period (the Holocene), and DO events are noted in glacial periods. The UN IPCC and its colleagues largely ignore all climate history prior to about 1850 when the Earth came out of the Little Ice Age (one of the coldest periods, if not the coldest period, in the Holocene). They have abandoned the scientific method in favor of politics. The Mark paper concludes with: “The Holocene climate change was characterized by cyclical warmings (such as: Holocene Thermal Maximum, Late Bronze Age, Roman Warm Period, MWP) and coolings (Bond Events: including Iron Age Cold Period, Dark Ages Cold Period and LIA). The IPCC claims that current warming is unprecedented in the last 2000 or even the last 125,000 years; this statement is very unconvincing, and it is not supported by the geological data. There is good evidence that both in the last 2000 years as well during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were higher or broadly similar to the ones in the current warming period, the Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers (especially in the northern hemisphere) either disappeared or were smaller. Much stronger summer monsoons in the Early and Middle Holocene made the Sahara green with savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The terms ‘the Holocene Thermal Maximum’ and ‘the Holocene Climatic Optimum’ are avoided by the IPCC (2021), and its popularized statements making the current warming look ‘unprecedented’ and therefore ‘unique’ are false and flatten the climate history (cf. Marcott et al., 2013). The climate is a product of complicated interdependence of many factors that have not been yet sufficiently recognized qualitatively and quantitatively. It is a great scientific challenge that requires an extensive interdisciplinary research. There is a crucial need to make climate science less political and climate policy more scientific.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Acid Oceans? The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “The Ocean Is Now Too Acidic to Be Considered Healthy, Planetary Scientist Says.” Apparently, the reporter did not bother to double check for contrary evidence, particularly with those who understand chemistry. A 2015 paper by Roger Cohen and William Happer “Fundamentals of Ocean pH” begins with [Footnotes omitted here]: “We are often told that the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels will cause dangerous ocean acidification. Actually, the oceans will remain comfortably alkaline and hospitable to life for the foreseeable future. This brief note is a quantitative review of the physical chemistry of ocean pH. High school chemistry and algebra should provide enough background to follow the discussion. An excellent introduction to the chemistry of the oceans can be found in the book: Seawater: Its Composition, Properties and Behavior, by Wright and Colling. More details on ocean pH can be found in a recent review by Tans. 2 Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg (OH)2, and calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4(^-2), which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water.” The paper then goes into some mathematics and chemistry and shows that the oceans will remain alkaline with a pH slightly less than 8, even if rainwater (carbonic acid, H2CO3) becomes more acidic with an atmosphere with a carbon dioxide concentration of 1000 parts per million in volume, more than twice the current level of CO2. The paper concludes with [Figures not shown here]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed.

We see that the FAO is running the risk of finding itself on the wrong side of history if it unethically suppresses free scientific discourse. We therefore strongly recommend that FAO returns to its original mandate of eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, eliminating poverty and driving forward economic progress for all, based on the latest objective climate research.

It stated: “Arrhenius used the term carbolic acid, a mixture of water and carbon dioxide that exists in liquid form but does not exist as a gas in the atmosphere.” TWTW should have stated: “carbonic acid, a compound of water and carbon dioxide.” TWTW appreciates such corrections. ********************* Number of the Week: Less than 10% [H/t Lindzen and Happer] In his book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin writes: “Water vapor is the most important of the greenhouse gases. Of course, the amount in the atmosphere at any given place and time varies greatly (the humidity changes a lot with the weather). But on average, water vapor amounts to only about 0.4 percent of the molecules in the atmosphere. Even so, it accounts for more than 90 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat. John Tyndall, the Irish physicist who was the first to study the infrared properties of gases, eloquently expressed its importance in an 1863 public lecture: ‘Aqueous [water] vapor is a blanket, more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man. Remove for a single summer-night the aqueous vapor from the air which overspreads this country, and you would assuredly destroy every plant capable of being destroyed by a freezing temperature. The warmth of our fields and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space, and the sun would rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost.’ “The next most significant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), is different from water vapor in that its concentration in the atmosphere is much the same all over the globe. CO2 currently accounts for about 7 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.” [Boldface added] (pp 50, 51) [This estimate assumes cloudiness, not clear skies.] Censorship Human Rights Commission’s call to regulate debate around climate change under fire Sky News host Paul Murray has fired up over the Australian Human Rights Commission’s call for regulation to climate change debate.

We find that, at a stand level, trees have become larger over time, with mean tree basal area increasing by 3.3% per decade (95% CI 2.4; 4.1). Larger trees have increased in both number and size, yet we observed similar rates of relative size gain in large and small trees. This evidence is consistent with a resource-driven boost for larger trees but also a reduction in suppression among smaller trees. These results, especially the persistence and consistency of tree size increases across Amazonian forest plots, communities and regions, indicate that any negative impacts of climate change on forests and large trees here have so far been mitigated by the positive effects of increased resources. The effect of additional CO2 on Narrowheart Lovegrass By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 From the CO2Science archive Problems in the Orthodoxy Big Advertising Joins Banks and Asset Managers in Ditching Sustainability By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 20, 2025 Study: “… high costs and risks …” Collapsed the Net Zero Banking Alliance By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 26, 2025 Link to paper: The Rise of Investor-Driven Climate Governance: From Myth to Institution? By Rami Kaplan, David L. Levy, Regulation & Governance, Feb 25, 2025 From abstract: However, ICG [Investor-driven climate governance] practices of disclosure and emission commitments became increasingly decoupled from actions to reduce emissions due to the weak business case for decarbonizing investors’ portfolios and corporate operations; the core economic mechanism was largely a myth. Some Greens finally admit they should be protesting against renewables, but are afraid of being called climate deniers By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Sep 23, 2025 Turns out National Policy is set by Namecalling Seeking a Common Ground Some Minimum Requirements for a Proper WOTUS Rule By Daren Bakst, Cornwall Alliance, Sep 17, 2025 Link to: Final Clarifying Definition of “Waters of the United States” By Staff, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Spring 2025 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of the Army are undertaking a rulemaking to revise key topics of the waters of the United States” definition in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), including continuous surface connection,” relatively permanent,” and jurisdictional versus non-jurisdictional ditches. These revisions focus on clarity, simplicity and improvements that will stand the test of time. [SEPP Comment: After over 50 years of confusion following the passage of the “Clean Water Act” in 1972, clear, simple rules defining Waters of the United States are much needed. It is ridiculous to have the courts decide.] Measurement Issues — Surface Sensational New Measurements of Uncorrupted Air Temperatures Destroy UK Met Office Constant Claims of ‘Records’ By Chris Morrison, The Daily Sceptic, Sep 22, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Link to: A Datum for Assessing ‘Spikes’ in PRT Data from Meteorological Office Sites By Eric Huxter, Frayed Ends Blog, Aug 29, 2025 Changing Weather Hurricane Bloating Discovery – No Global Warming Needed By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 Link to paper: Tropical cyclones expand faster at warmer relative sea surface temperature By Danyang Wang, et al., PNAS, Sep 15, 2025 From Watts: Before this work, scientists knew that some hurricanes expanded significantly during their lifetimes while others stayed compact. But the factors behind that difference were not well understood. Wang and Chavas showed that the rapid growth of storms is tied to “hot spots” in the ocean. These are localized areas where the water is significantly warmer than the surrounding tropical waters. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season gave a striking example of why storm size matters. Hurricane Helene expanded rapidly before making landfall, ballooning into one of the largest storms in U.S. history at an estimated width of over 400 miles and causing unprecedented damage. Germany Sees Bumper 2025 Harvest As Earlier Climate Forecasts Of A “Hellish Summer” Fail By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Sep 20, 2025 “In many places, the fruit trees across the country are laden with fruit. In some cases, they are so heavily laden that individual branches are breaking under the enormous weight,” the DWD reports. How Unusual Was This Summer? By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Sep 21, 2025 So, about those non-hurricanes… By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Aces low By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Changing Seas #HaveItBothWays: Atlantic cod stocks By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 If you are a Canadian of a certain vintage you will remember the 1992 cod moratorium in which a 500-year-old Newfoundland fishery was brought to a sudden halt as the cod population crashed, and the government had to take drastic steps to prevent complete extinction of the species. What was supposed to be a two-year suspension became permanent, although a small cod fishery was reopened in 2024. This being the 1990s, no one thought to blame climate change for the disappearance of the fish, instead pointing to the massive fishing fleets that had been emptying the oceans of everything that moved for decades. But never ones to pass up a chance, a group of climate scientists published a paper in 2003 based on, of course, climate models not real-world data, and it warned that ocean warming would speed up the decline of North Sea cod which were already almost all gone. Unfortunately for them, though maybe fortunately for the fish, the #HaveItBothWays rule soon kicked into gear. Latest Science Further Exposes Lies About Rising Seas By Vijay Jayaraj, WUWT, Sep 22, 2025 Changing Cryosphere – Land / Sea Ice Arctic Sea Ice Refuses To Disappear (Again!) By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 For sheer persistence in getting it wrong, however, the prize must go to Professor Peter Wadhams, Professor of Ocean Physics, and Head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge: Arctic Sea Ice Minimum 2025: Another Year, Another Non-Event By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 Solar cycles, ocean oscillations (such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and shifting wind patterns all play into the distribution and persistence of Arctic ice. Pretending this is purely about CO₂ levels is simplistic at best and misleading at worst. As NSIDC itself admits, the flattening trend is still a subject of “active debate” among scientists. Perhaps it’s time for policymakers and journalists to debate it as well — instead of pretending the science is “settled.” So, about that rebounding ice By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 As we’ve mentioned, there are several ways to draw a trend line through complicated data including the one for Arctic ice. But they are not all equally valid. Even statistics involves some art as well as science. But it should not include hocus-pocus. In this regard we continue to insist, in the face of alarmists saying it’s long-term trends that matter, that it is in fact long-term trends that matter. And we also continue to insist, in this regard, that it is the dreaded cherry-picking to lean too hard on the fact that the modern satellite record coincides with a cyclical peak in Arctic ice around 1979 that cannot rationally be ascribed to human influence, since there is no plausible argument that we were cooling the planet from the 1940s through the 1970s, though at the time it was blamed on, yes, our burning fossil fuels by people who seem to start with the verdict that our civilization is evil, rapacious and self-destructive and work backwards to an indictment that fits the short-run evidence. Changing Earth Earth’s natural CO2 vacuum cleaners By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 20, 2025 Link to paper: Earth’s silicate weathering continuum By Gerrit Trapp-Müller, et al., Nature Geoscience, Aug 7, 2025 From the abstract: Chemical weathering of silicate rocks redistributes major, minor and trace elements through coupled dissolution–precipitation reactions. These weathering processes drive shifts in ocean acid–base chemistry, modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and providing a stabilizing feedback in the carbon cycle. Silicate weathering occurs in both terrestrial and marine environments, releasing (‘forward’) or consuming alkalinity (‘reverse’), but these have largely been perceived as independent and studied in isolation. Earthquake jolts San Francisco Bay Area By Ryan Mense and Alex Baker, The Hill, Sep 22, 2025 Initially, the USGS deemed the quake a 4.6 before revising it down to 4.3. Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine World Cereal Output Set For all-Time High By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Apparently the UN IPCC ignores the reports of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.] Lowering Standards National Academies go preposterous on CO2 By David Wojick, CFACT, Sep 23, 2025 You would think the National Academy of Sciences understands science, but you would be wrong. Their president just approved a report whose conclusion is scientifically impossible! The report is jointly from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). Titled “Effects of Human-Caused Greenhouse Gas Emissions on U.S. Climate, Health, and Welfare,” this squirrelly tome is a formal comment on EPA’s proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding. Clearly NASEM is no longer fit for purpose. Ideally, Congress should revoke its charter. At the least the President should issue an executive order instructing the federal agencies not to use NASEM. It has long been standard practice for agencies launching new programs to run them by NASEM for approval. This practice should stop. STEVE MILLOY: Rigged Report By National Academies Aims To Thwart Trump Energy Agenda By Steve Milloy, Daily Caller, Sep 21, 2025 There is not enough room in this column for a comprehensive critique of the NAS report, but here is just one other egregious example. Citing an EPA graph, the report asserts that heat waves have increased since the 1960s. But the report studiously avoids another more complete EPA graph showing that heatwaves have dramatically decreased since the 1930s. The Rocky Mountain Institute’s Climate & DEI Colonialism in Africa By Ken Braun, Real Clear Energy, Sep 23, 2025 According to Our World in Data, there are 677.4 million people living without “an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.” Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, and 156 million of these desperate souls—23% of the world total—reside in those three nations set to receive RMI’s “women energy practitioners.” But rather than bringing genuine and desperately needed energy to Africa, the Rocky Mountain Institute and its deeply deluded donors are offering unreliable renewables delivered by a women-only DEI initiative. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? Beware How the Climate Crusade ‘Partners’ With the Media and ‘Educates’ the Courts By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Sep 24, 2025 The Climate Crisis Anti Baby Movement By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The Aussie ABC thinks Zoomers are staging a baby strike until their elders fix the climate crisis. Claim: Aussie Climate Refugees are Moving to Tasmania By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 24, 2025 So, despite the ABC’s attempt to make it look like climate change is driving a demographic shift to colder states, this is no more happening in Australia than it is in the USA. Warm lifestyle states like Queensland and Florida both enjoy strong population growth and will continue to be a favorite destination for the foreseeable future. False, New York Times, Climate Change Isn’t Causing More European Heat Deaths By Anthony Watts, Climate Realism, Sep 19, 2025 You Can’t Get the Extinguisher without Breaking Glass By Geoff Chambers, Climate Scepticism, Sep 24, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Communicating Better to the Public – Exaggerate, or be Vague?

NPR warned of “irreversible” sea-level rise in 2023, ignoring tide gauge records that show no acceleration beyond historical norms. News outlets regularly report on “unprecedented” floods, yet data indicate no uptick in floods due to climate change. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda on Children Waves of conformism By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Speaking of long-term trends and data, the cool kids or at this point the hot kids are all independently stampeding to attribution science, a form of hocus-pocus that bypasses evidence to get the verdict in question. For instance “Recent Canadian heat waves made much more likely by human-caused climate change” from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Which you might think means they have data proving they are happening more often. Pfft. This is attribution science, where all you only need models, not data. Communicating Better to the Public – Protest A picturesque Yorkshire village is battling an ugly net-zero facility By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 21, 2025 Questioning European Green The greenlash is here: Britain cannot afford Net Zero and democracy at the same time By Maurice Cousins, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 Link to report: Britons’ attitudes to high energy bills: the permacrisis that keeps burning By Chris Annous & Archie Herrick, More in Common, September 2025, Funded by Octopus Energy, UK energy supplier. Click to access britain-s-high-energy-bills_-the-permacrisis-that-keeps-on-burning-6.pdf The survey and focus groups referenced in this report and the writing of this report has been funded by Octopus Energy. More in Common has maintained, as is the case for all of our partnership work, full editorial independence when conducting this research and writing this report. The views expressed within this report are therefore the views of More in Common. From Cousins: Contrary to what critics claim, opposition to renewables is not an anti-climate science or ideological position. Green energy is capital-intensive, infrastructure-heavy, and drives extraordinary system inefficiency. Even if turbines and panels fall in price, the total bill to consumers will remain higher than the legacy model of baseload generation. Britain’s industrial disaster By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Questioning Green Elsewhere Admitting the obvious By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 We also like advocates of wind and solar thinking and talking about the physics and engineering of grid stability. If they really can make it work, if they can overcome problems of scale and distribution and battery technology leaps forward and so on, we could be persuaded that wind and solar have a bright future. But we really do need to see the practicalities acknowledged and analyzed. Including the very basic point that, when you get down to such things, it’s complicated, especially given the ways in which subsidies distort the picture. And that one thing that’s certainly complicated, for them anyway, is that the “green energy transition” at least coincided with, if it did not cause, a vast surge in the cost of power. Funding Issues Energy Department plans to claw back $13B in green funds By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Sep 24, 2025 Why Are Green Activists Suddenly Outraged at the Billions Wasted Paying Wind Farms to Switch Off When it’s Too Windy? By Ben Pile, The Daily Sceptic, Sep 23, 2025 The Political Games Continue Jenrick backs overhaul of UK CfDs Press Release, Net Zero Watch, Sep 25, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Jenrick is a Shadow Justice Secretary and former Cabinet minister.] Litigation Issues Climate Lawsuits in Montana By Edwin X Berry, Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, His Blog, Sep 20, 2025 [H/t Ron Clutz] The fundamental science issue in all climate lawsuits is whether these unstated hypotheses are true or false: (1) Human CO2 causes all the CO2 increase above 280 ppm. (2) This CO2 increase causes global warming. (3) This global warming causes the plaintiffs claimed damages. Judicial Limits on Glyphosate and Climate ‘Jackpot Justice’ Litigation Narrowly defined decision provides guidance on ‘evidence’ for alleged cause of harm By Paul Driessen, WUWT, Sep 23, 2025 Although the US Supreme Court frequently overrules it, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (covering California, eight other western states and two US territories) deserves applause for its recent Engilis v. Monsanto decision. The Fallacy of ‘Exxon Knew” (Part II) By Robert Bradley Jr. Master Resource, Sep 24, 2025 Part I, Sep 23, 2025 Bradley: This memo from certain employees never made it to a company position for cause. Global cooling was the bigger concern back then, and the above memo did not investigate the SO2 offset, much less the benefits from CO2 fertilization and incremental warming. Peak Oil and Peak Gas was the intellectual/practical concern of this era. [SEPP Comment: The memo is dated October 16, 1979. The administration of President Carter (1977 to 1981) and Congress passed laws advocating the use of coal to replace oil and natural gas, which, based on faulty models, Washington feared would soon be exhausted.] Subsidies and Mandates Forever Congressional testimony reveals the hidden causes behind America’s looming $38 billion energy rate hikes: ‘If things keep going like this, [bills] are gonna be higher next year’ “The U.S. is falling far behind global competitors.” By Kristen Lawrence, The Cool Down, Sep 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] On top of all these reasons for soaring energy rates, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is making electricity more expensive by phasing out tax credits for clean energy, such as solar and wind power, resulting in slower construction of renewable projects and restricting the supply of affordable power. [SEPP Comment: If wind and solar are low cost, why are subsidies needed?] Offshore windfarm receives £2bn subsidies in just six years Press release, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 As a result, Hornsea 1 is currently receiving a guaranteed £200 per megawatt hour for its power, nearly three times current market prices. Energy Issues – Non-US New LCCC Dashboards By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 23, 2025 They cover CfDs [Contracts for Difference] and Capacity Market stuff amongst other things. I’ll have a play around, but it seems they avoid an awful lot of legwork and analysis which I have been doing on spreadsheets. I’ve shown below a typical CfD graph, which shows subsidy costs by quarter, and the quarterly market price. I would recommend using it to convince doubters, as it is the official source. London Array Subsidies Hit £300 Million Last Year By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 At current prices, London Array has been paid £3.6 billion in subsidies since it opened in 2013. And all for just 2 TWh a year, less than 1% of the electricity supplied in the UK. Energy Issues – Australia CCA: Artificial Intelligence is a Challenge to Climate Goals By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 23, 2025 Link to: 2035 Targets Advice By the Climate Change Authority, Commonwealth of Australia, 2025 Click to access 2035%20Targets%20Advice.pdf Senate inquiry into climate and energy seeks truth, allegedly An attempt by the Greens to silence climate change dissent By Alan Moran, Spectator.com AU, Sep 12, 2025 It is my belief that the target is to identify presumptive funding for and to prevent the dissemination of information that is contrary to the belief of dangerous human-induced climate change. It is directed at those who dispute claims that the ‘science is settled’ and that harmful global outcomes will ensue unless urgent action is taken. The aim is to combat and suppress contrary views.

This is like smashing your car with a baseball bat, then screaming at the mechanic when it won’t start. Oil and Natural Gas – the Future or the Past?

Batteries cannot supply any power, as power is generated somewhere else first. That electricity still has to be paid for in addition to the costs of the battery storage. The “BESS” DELUSION: Why battery storage is a FANTASY By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 22, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Video about Eastern Australia going wind and solar – 12 million MWh of battery storage needed? At what cost?] Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Porsche delays new electric car after demand slump By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Carbon Schemes Pouring Money Down The CO2 Drain By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 The Government has just announced two more carbon capture projects: It goes without saying that spending taxpayer money on non-jobs, that create no added value for the economy, will act as a brake on economic growth in the long run. I cannot think of anything more stupid than to dig a big hole and bury money in it! California Dreaming California’s Latest Climate Theater: Newsom Signs Another Expensive Illusion By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The core of the package is an extension of the cap-and-trade program—rebranded “cap-and-invest”—all the way to 2045. That rebranding glosses over that the structure is largely the same: companies must either reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, buy emission allowances, or invest in offsets. The revenues from auctioning allowances are then redistributed (some), invested (many), or spent (often). In recent years, those auctions have raised between $3 billion and $4.3 billion annually. These revenues fund programs ranging from wildfire prevention to transportation, housing, and utility credits. California Dems Scramble To Boost Oil Production After Running Refiners Out Of Town By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Sep 19, 2025 “After years of pushing radical climate policies that punished working families, Governor Newsom is finally waking up to what Californians need, he’s now scrambling to secure the very fossil fuels he tried to eliminate,” CEO of the American Energy Institute Jason Isaac told the Daily Caller News Foundation previously. “This sudden embrace of petroleum isn’t leadership, it’s survival. California’s energy future depends on realism, not green delusions.” The Cost and the Upside of the “Big Gulp” By Edward Ring, What’s Current, Accessed Sep 25, 2025 Link to study: A New Approach to Accounting for Environmental Water: Insights from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta By Greg Gartrell, Public Policy Institute of California, November 2017 Click to access r_1117ggr.pdf Other Scientific News NASA, NOAA Launch Three Spacecraft to Map Sun’s Influence Across Space By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 25, 2025 Over the next few months, the spacecraft will make their way to their destination — a location between Earth and the Sun, about a million miles from Earth, called Lagrange point 1 (L1). They should arrive by January and, once their instrument checkouts and calibrations are complete, begin their missions to better understand space weather and protect humanity. Forest Composition and Fire History In Light of New Evidence By Don Healy, WUWT, Sep 25, 2025 Link to paper: The North American tree-ring fire-scar network By Ellis Q. Margolis, et al., Ecosphere, 2022 From the abstract: The historical influence of Indigenous and non-Indigenous human land use on fire regimes varies in space and time. A 20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). From Healy: Implications for Fire Management – The paper likely argues for integrating Indigenous fire stewardship into contemporary land management—not just as a cultural restoration, but as an ecological necessity. – It challenges dominant narratives that treat fire as inherently destructive, instead reframing it as a regenerative force when guided by traditional ecological knowledge.

Public health departments warn against lone star ticks and AGS, and scientists are working to develop an inoculation to AGS. Herein, we argue that if eating meat is morally impermissible, then efforts to prevent the spread of tickborne AGS are also morally impermissible. Quit Promoting Mad Schemes, New York Times, Blocking the Sun is a Dangerous Climate Gamble By Anthony Watts, Climate Realism, Sep 25, 2025 In The New York Times’ (NYT) op-ed, “Turns Out Air Pollution Was Good for Something,” Zeke Hausfather and David Keith argue that because sulfur particles from past industrial pollution once cooled the planet by reflecting sunlight, policymakers should now consider a deliberate version of that process. They suggest aircraft could inject sulfur into the upper atmosphere to mimic the cooling once provided by dirty smokestacks, pointing to volcanic eruptions such as Mount Pinatubo in 1991 as evidence the method would work.

THE EU IS making moves that would trample on hard-fought protections meant to prevent catastrophic workplace tragedies and environmental abuses. Ireland should stand up against that effort. Activists across Europe from Brussels to Dublin took to the streets last week to demand greater regulation of bad behaviour by big corporations. The protests were a response to an attempt by the EU to gut protections meant to ensure that disasters like the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh 12 years ago – which killed more than 1,100 garment workers, mostly women who were sewing clothes for some of Europe’s biggest brands – never happens again. The international outcry after the Rana Plaza disaster sparked reforms, most notably France’s 2017 “duty of vigilance” law, which for the first time imposed legal obligations on French-based companies to prevent human rights and environmental abuses throughout their global supply chains. This duty of vigilance law requires large multinationals to publicly disclose and act on risks in their operations across their value chains globally. France’s leadership spurred momentum across Europe, culminating in the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) which is designed to compel companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remedy human rights and climate harms across their entire value chains. It requires accountability through civil liability, involvement of stakeholders, and yearly monitoring. While the directive is not without its faults, most notably the exclusion of the financial sector, it still holds the potential to deliver tangible protections for millions of women working in global supply chains, from garment factories to farms to mines. The Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed in April 2013. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo It was a hard-won achievement, the result of years of sustained pressure from trade unions, NGOs, women’s rights organisations, and environmental groups across Europe and the world. The directive faced intense resistance from corporate actors and member states and only passed after months of deadlock and political brinkmanship. But that hard-won progress is under serious threat from an EU “Omnibus” proposal unveiled last February that would eliminate the protections meant to ensure what happened in Rana Plaza never happens again. Driven by intense corporate lobbying, the Omnibus proposal strips the CSDDD of its core protections. It limits due diligence requirements to a company’s direct, first-tier suppliers, ignoring the deeper layers of subcontracting where the worst abuses, particularly against women, frequently occur. It weakens stakeholder involvement by narrowing who must be consulted, effectively sidelining already marginalised voices. Critically, it significantly curtails civil liability, meaning victims would have limited legal routes to hold companies accountable, and it blocks trade unions and NGOs from representing them in court. Advertisement It also waters down climate obligations by making climate transition plans optional, undermining efforts to address the environmental harm that disproportionately affects communities in the Global South. This is not about reducing red tape. It is a slash and burn of protections. One of the most glaring weaknesses in the original CSDDD was the exclusion of the financial sector. While banks, insurers and investment firms were not required to conduct due diligence on activities such as loans, investments, and insurance, a review clause offered a chance to revisit this gap in two years’ time. The Omnibus proposal would scrap that clause entirely, locking in the exemption and eliminating any future prospect of aligning financial flows with the EU’s human rights obligations or the goals of the Paris Agreement. This rollback is particularly dangerous in light of new research from ActionAid and Trócaire that exposed the staggering scale of harmful finance coming from the financial sector in Ireland. As of June 2024, Irish-based subsidiaries of investment companies held €31.76 billion ($34 billion) in fossil fuel investments. Much of this has been shielded from scrutiny thanks to unprecedented lobbying from the financial industry. BlackRock, one of the major investors through Ireland of fossil fuel, despite its public sustainability pledges, is among the most active and influential players pushing to weaken regulation. The Omnibus, if passed, would ensure such actors remain beyond the reach of meaningful accountability. While corporate lobbyists continue to push their agenda in Brussels, people mobilised across Europe and Ireland to push back. In Brussels thousands marched to demand that Europe strengthen, not weaken, protections for people and the planet. And outside Leinster House civil society groups, trade unions, and NGOs challenged the “deregulation” agenda that is becoming more and more prominent in Irish economic policy. This law will translate into real impacts for women globally. In Bangladesh, for example, research shows 80% of female garment workers in Dhaka have witnessed or experienced gender-based violence. With due diligence limited to first-tier suppliers, deeper subcontracting where such abuses thriv will escape oversight. Companies prominent in Ireland like Primark, Nike, and H&M have already been implicated in serious corporate abuse, including wage theft in factories across Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Indonesia, where workers were underpaid during the Covid-19 pandemic. Without legislation with teeth, corporate profit will comes first and women’s rights, climate change, human rights will all suffer. The Irish government is sending mixed signals on this issue. Ministers have publicly declared their support for the CSDDD. Yet they also express backing for the Omnibus proposal that would effectively gut it. This contradiction is reflected in recent policy developments in Ireland. The government just launched the “Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity” which frames deregulation and so-called “red tape cutting” as essential to Ireland’s growth. Decisions made in Brussels and backed in Leinster House have direct consequences for the women stitching our clothes, farming our food, or extracting the minerals in our phones. They are the ones who will be left more vulnerable if corporate accountability is gutted. The Irish government must reject the Omnibus rollbacks and defend the core of the CSDDD. Ireland must also look beyond Brussels and introduce a strong, gender-responsive national due diligence law that holds Irish companies and investors accountable for their impact on people and the planet. This must include financial services within Ireland’s foreign direct investment. We owe it to the women who died in Rana Plaza and to the millions still working in similar conditions not to let history repeat itself. Anything less is prioritising profit over people, and silence over justice.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The founder and chief executive officer of the brand management and entertainment firm expects to transition to executive chairman in around two years. Senior Editor, Men's Jamie Salter has come a long way in the past 15 years. The 62-year-old Toronto native started his career in sports marketing and was the cofounder of Ride snowboards in the early 1990s. After that company went public, he and Fanatics’ founder and executive chairman Michael Rubin created Global Sports Inc., which eventually became GSI Commerce. Once he exited that business, Salter turned his attention to licensing, cofounding Hilco Consumer Capital. After a difference of opinion with Hilco’s majority owner, he partnered with Leonard Green and created Authentic Brands Group. Related Articles Shoe Industry News Puma Shares Seesaw on Authentic Brands Group Takeover Speculation Fashion Features WWD's 115 Newsmakers: S to Z Today, Authentic has amassed a portfolio that encompasses more than 50 brands including Reebok, Brooks Brothers and Champion that generate annual retail sales of $32 billion globally. The addition of Guess by early year will bring that number to $38 billion. But that’s not good enough for Salter, whose goal is to reach $100 billion in sales within the next five years by purchasing brands that have sales of more than $1 billion with global expansion potential while also expanding his reach in the entertainment and hospitality sectors. You May Also Like Authentic, which is on track to post 7 percent organic growth from its brands this year, now has headquarters in New York, London and Shanghai and offices in Los Angeles, Miami, Tokyo and South Korea. It counts 1,800 licensing partners globally, and its licensees operate 16,000 stores and 29,000 shops-in-shop around the world. The group is by far the largest of what is a new wave of brand management companies, which are rewriting the fashion and retail landscape in the U.S. by snapping up brand seemingly every week. While it’s a model that first emerged in the U.S. almost 50 years ago, Authentic and the likes of WHP Global, Bluestar and Marquee Brands are now taking it to another level. Here, Salter talks about his journey, how he’s built Authentic and his plans to pass the reins to the newly named president, Matt Maddox, within the next two years. WWD: How has the licensing model evolved since you started 15 years ago? Jamie Salter: It’s dramatically different. When we came into the business, Iconix was really the prize in the industry. It was doing DTR [direct-to-retail] with big retailers, and it was very item driven and category specific. When I looked at the business back then, I always asked the question, “Why don’t they sell home and shoes and whatever?” Well, it wasn’t because they didn’t want to, but they had a DTR [strategy]. So I said, OK, I know they’re doing really well, but that’s not going to work for us. We have to have another angle on how can we do well in the licensing business. So we took a different approach. WWD: And what was that? J.S.: Our approach was we’re going to go after wholesalers, and we’re going to do it by category and by territory, and they’re going to have to sell into retailers. That was very different from what Iconix was doing. So you could say we got lucky, or you could say we’re smart. I would say it’s probably a little bit of both. But what it really proved to me was you could actually grow the businesses so much bigger. WWD: Was there a downside? J.S.: You could argue our model was more expensive to run than a traditional licensing model, because we had to put a lot of money from the royalties that we were collecting into marketing. In the beginning, we weren’t putting enough into the marketing side of the business, but we learned very early on — when my partner Nick [Woodhouse] came into the business — that we really had to spend money on marketing. But we couldn’t afford it. It was hard. WWD: But I assume you decided to make the investment? J.S.: I met a guy named Adam Kronengold who is still with me today. He’s our chief digital officer. He was one of our first employees and in his interview, he asked me how many social media followers I had. I said, “What do you mean? Me? Jamie Salter?” He said, “No, not you, your company.” I said, “I don’t really understand the question.” So he goes on Instagram and says, “You don’t have an account.” This is in 2010, and he said, “Marilyn Monroe has an account. She has 250,000 followers. You know you can talk to people, post stuff and market.” I said, “How much does that cost?” He says, “It’s free. You can put up a post, send your message and tell people where Marilyn Monroe is being sold. You can do whatever you want. It’s your channel.” WWD: Guess he convinced you. J.S.: I asked him how Instagram made money and he said it didn’t make a lot then, but their whole strategy was to get everybody on social media and eventually turn it into an advertising platform. I said, “I like free — you’re hired.” So we were one of the very early adopters in the social media world. I think that is really the base of Authentic Brands — we really built the company like a tech start-up. Here we are 15 years after and we’re still like a start-up in the way we think. We’re always on the cusp of what’s next. WWD: How do you differ from the other brand management companies you compete with today like WHP Global, Marquee Brands and Bluestar? J.S.: We welcome competition, and we want them to do well, because if they do well, it’s good for us. But everyone builds a niche for themselves. WHP is using the Iconix/Sequential playbook and they’ve transitioned from that a little bit. I think Yehuda [Shmidman, WHP’s chief executive officer] learned some good hard lessons through his experience there and he’s building a pretty good platform [at WHP]. But scale matters now in this business because of the money you have to spend in order to build these brands and keep them relevant in the marketplace. We have a big international platform and nobody else really has that. But where we’re really separate from them is that we have 80 people in the marketing department today, we have 700 million social media followers — that’s 10 percent of the people that live on the planet. We’re on TikTok and WeChat and Instagram and Red Note — we’re on every platform around the globe. We have social media influencers in 150 different languages. WWD: Is that why you’re often always the first call when a brand is for sale? J.S.: If you have an opportunity to partner with Authentic versus Bluestar versus WHP, you’re going to partner with Authentic if it’s the same economics, just because it’s a much bigger platform. We can actually pay more because our platform is so efficient. And we can run businesses more efficiently because of our sheer size. WWD: You swooped in at the last minute to buy Guess even though WHP already had a deal. What happened there? J.S.: They always say anything’s for sale for the right price. But that’s just not true. [Guess cofounder] Paul Marciano was looking for a partner and unless he got the best deal for his shareholders, he would never have sold the company. So he’s selling 51 percent to us, and the family [with CEO Carlos Alberini] will own other 49 percent. Relationships matter, strategy matters, legacy matters. Paul’s last name is on the door. Look at LVMH: the family is all involved in the business and I think that’s why it’s such an incredible company. They learned from their father and they care — the legacy lives on. My name is on the door too — Authentic is the Salters. My family will be involved with Authentic Brands forever, I hope. WWD: All four of your sons are in the business, right? J.S.: Yes. And at some point, Jamie Salter will have to hang up the skates as I get older. WWD: In January, you brought in Matt Maddox, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, as president. What is his role? J.S.: He worked with Steve Wynn for 22 years and for the last four or five years, was CEO of Wynn Properties. Everyone asked me why I didn’t hire someone from the fashion business. Look, we’re in the licensing business, which means we’re effectively a landlord. We buy these great brands, we fix them up, we market them and we rent out rooms. And the rooms happen to be shoes and socks and intimate apparel and home goods. And we do that by territory, by category. Matt understood the retail luxury space, because he has his own mall at the Wynn. He understood that he has to rent out his rooms every day. He has to market. He understood the entertainment business and events and celebrities and athletes. He has relationships with all these. We knew a lot of the same people and were partners with the Wynn through our live events division. WWD: Sounds like a good match. J.S.: Matt was offered some of the biggest jobs in the United States and initially he said no to me [when I offered him the job]. I asked him why and he said, “I’ve looked at your business. It’s working really well. You’re doing an incredible job. You’re not going anywhere. You don’t need me.” So I called Steve [Wynn] and told him he had to convince Matt to take the job. He did and we hired Matt. WWD: What are your ultimate plans for Matt? J.S.: I made a commitment to Matt that he would become the CEO of the company in the next two years. I will move to executive chairman. And you know, people ask me, “Are you OK with that?” Well, I’m super excited. Matt is 49, he’s young, he’s beyond smart. He’s working incredibly well with the team. He’s working great with my children, which is really important to me. He’s mentoring my son, Corey, who, you know, I ultimately want one day to run the company with his brothers. But I’ve got an incredible partner in Matt, who I believe will lead Authentic to $100 billion. WWD: The business community is filled with founders who find they can’t actually step aside when they turn over the reins to someone else. Why is this different? J.S.: Like I told Matt, I’m not going anywhere. But we’ve got to stay young; we’ve got to stay nimble. He understands the loyalty side of the business better than me because they had a big loyalty program at the Wynn. He understands the digital side of the business. He’s doing an unbelievable job upgrading Authentic on the process side. And if we do decide to go public over the next year or two, he’ll be an excellent CEO that the Street can rely on. I’m excited to just continue doing what I’m really good at, which is building great relationships around the world and working on the M&A side, and I have a great partner in Matt to run the day-to-day. WWD: Sounds like hiring someone from outside the fashion industry is working out for you. J.S.: I’m a big believer in hiring outside the industry — not that we don’t hire inside the industry, because we still need merchants and great marketing people. But if you really look at Authentic, the average age here is about 35. And they come out of the digital space, the legal space, the finance system. Authentic is a big marketing department, a big legal department, a big digital department. So, we’re hiring people from Meta and Google and Microsoft and Amazon. You still need merchants to touch and feel and make great product, because you can have the greatest digital team and the greatest marketing team but if don’t have good product, then it doesn’t work. But at the end of the day, data is everything. WWD: What do you look for when you’re hiring people? J.S.: When you’re hot, you attract great talent. When I’m hiring someone, the first question I ask is, can AI do this job? If the answer is no, the second question is: is that person smarter than you? And we’re a loyal group, so if you’re really good, you’re going to be here forever. But Authentic is not for everyone. Do not come here if you’re looking for a 9-to-5 job because we work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We’re a global company, so we’re always working. With the globalization of the world, the internet, social media, the news cycles and staying ahead of trends and culture, you always have to be on. WWD: You also have other components to your business beyond brand management. J.S.: Yes. Twenty-five percent of the platform is entertainment. [Our competitors] don’t have an entertainment business. And entertainment, in my opinion, drives fashion culture. The entertainment business is really music culture and sports culture, which is where we have a big edge. The other 75 percent of our turnover is rooted in the lifestyle space. WWD: How do you evolve the company going forward, where are the opportunities? J.S.: We think we’re just scratching the surface. I know people think that’s kind of crazy with a business that has about $32 billion in annual retail systemwide sales. But we think we can be about $100 billion within the next five years. It’s not as crazy as you think when we pull off deals like Guess, which does $6 billion at retail. There are lots of other brands that are in that $1 billion to $10 billion range that we could buy. And we really, truly believe that we will crack those opportunities. Over the next five years, we’ll do another four or five big deals and that’s another $50 billion. This year alone, and the year is not over, we added almost $7 billion in revenue. WWD: You were close to going public a couple of years ago and then decided against it. Are you revisiting the idea? J.S.: Authentic is a very different model. We trade like a tech company because we are a tech company. Think about it. When you have 75 percent margin, 99 percent cash conversion and virtually no capex, you trade like a software company. So could we be public? The answer is yes. Should we be public? I don’t know. There’s no need to be. Why is SpaceX not public? It doesn’t need to be. We trade at a very high multiple; we have 36 percent growth in the company. We’re low levered. We took our first money from Leonard Green in 2010 and the company has been self-funded since then. WWD: But you have other investors including General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, Simon Property Group and Brookfield, among others. J.S.: True. There’s been $9 billion of secondaries in the last three years, but that’s just one shareholder selling to a new buyer. There’s been no need for investment from outside. We actually just bought $1 billion of stock back and retired the shares, so the company’s very flush with cash. WWD: A lot of the brands you buy are distressed. Is that what you look for? J.S.: The brands aren’t necessarily distressed, the companies are. Reebok wasn’t a bad brand. Adidas just wasn’t putting the effort into one of the greatest athletic brands in the world. Their focus was on building Adidas. They milked Reebok as far as they possibly could, and they didn’t need it anymore. We’ve owned Reebok now for a couple years and we’ve almost doubled the business. We still have lots of work to do, but Reebok is a $6 billion business and our ambition is to grow to a $10 billion business over the next three years — and we feel very confident we’re going to get there. WWD: So what is the criteria you use when exploring a purchase? J.S.: A good brand but a broken business. Champion wasn’t broken but Hanes needed liquidity. Truth be told, I spoke to Gildan before we bought Champion. I said, “Let’s go buy Hanes together. I’ll take Champion. You take Hanes.” We ended up buying Champion. They ended up buying Hanes, which is interesting. We could have done the deal together. Anyway, our model is to license by category, by territory, to best-in-class partners. So you get the best underwear-maker, you get the best sock-maker, you get the best sportswear-maker. It means the business grows much quicker. But we have to unwind the overhead so we can run these companies much more efficiently. People always say, “When you buy a company, all the jobs go away.” It’s not true — lots of new jobs are created. When we look at our portfolio, I would say that probably 75 percent of the jobs either stay or new jobs are created. So maybe people lose their jobs in California, but there are new jobs in New York, and it’s more efficient. WWD: Where do you see the growth coming from in the future? J.S.: Entertainment and kids’ animation. Those are two really big areas for us. We believe entertainment really does drive lifestyle. So we’re going to continue to drive that. And when I say the kids’ space, think Disney, think Mattel, that type of stuff. And with Matt’s background, we’re moving into the hospitality business. We’ve done multiple deals now for hotels and condos. We have the Barneys hotel. We have Sports Illustrated resorts, we have Eddie Bauer lodges. We have Nautica condos going up in Mexico. Our hospitality business is bigger than you would think. Also, beauty. Our beauty business is over a couple billion dollars today, but there’s big opportunity there. And you’re going to see us do more deals like David Beckham and Shaq. WWD: Speaking of Beckham and Shaquille O’Neal, neither of them has been playing for a while. And you also own the rights to Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, who are dead. J.S.: We don’t call them dead — they’re icons, and with AI coming into play, Marilyn Monroe is going to be on fire in 2026, which is her 100th anniversary [of her birth]. We’ve done an enormous number of deals around Marilyn Monroe. And don’t be surprised if you see her in movies again. And look at what’s going on with Elvis Presley. There was the movie and we now have an immersive theater production, Elvis Evolution, at the 02 in London. WWD: But how do you appeal to young people who don’t know Elvis and never saw Shaq or David Beckham play? J.S.: Shaq has never been bigger — no pun intended. Shaq’s business is 10 times as big as when we partnered with him in 2015. And David Beckham‘s business has doubled since we joined forces Now, we’ve only been working on David’s business for a couple years — Shaq’s we’ve owned much longer. I’m not going to say live celebrities are better, but there are bigger opportunities than if they’re not with us anymore. WWD: Let’s talk about the Authentic Luxury Group. Can you explain what that is and how it’s working? J.S.: ALG is a joint venture between Saks Global and us that licenses the IP of the Saks brands and select Authentic premium brands. Richard [Baker, executive chairman of Saks Global] has had a bit of a bumpy road. He is a total optimist and a great visionary, but he needs to prove to the world that financially, he’s set up properly. It seems he’s on the right track now but we’re going to continue to be careful. We’re going to continue to build the affordable luxury — or premium — side of our business. Luxury is a word you have to be careful with. LVMH is luxury, Kering is luxury, Prada is luxury. Vince is premium, Brooks Brothers is premium, Hugo Boss is premium. We’ll continue to play in the premium space in a big way, because it’s the next level from where we are today. We have the full support of Saks, Neiman’s and Amazon, because that’s the joint venture, and we’ll fully support Richard and his journey. But we’re going to be careful. WWD: Are you still looking to buy Marc Jacobs? J.S.: I can’t really comment on that. What I will tell you is we will continue to look at companies in that space, like Marc Jacobs, and we’ll see where it goes. WWD: Let’s talk about the whole department store and retail space where you have a lot of partners. It’s not easy out there. J.S.: We have to go where the customers go. If T.J. Maxx is a winner, we’ve got to sell them. if Burlington, Target and Walmart are winners, we’ve got to sell them. The consumption is the same as it was a year ago — people aren’t buying any less product. They’re just buying from different places. So we continue to go where the customers go, and that’s really been our model. We think independent retailers, or omnichannel retailers like Lucky or Brooks Brothers, are actually important to building these brands. It’s tough, but it’s important to the model. Today, we have about 6,000 licensed full-price/outlet stores around the globe. And then there are another 24,000 shops-in-shop. So when you really look at our portfolio, half of our volume is done through stores that have our name above the door, and that’s a big investment. It’s going to take a long time before Kohl’s and JCPenney and Macy’s are not here anymore. But they’ve got to continue to reinvent themselves. Great retailers survive. Look at Harrods: it’s packed wall-to-wall all the time. WWD: Why do you think that is? J.S.: It may be the model: a department store made up of all concessions. It doesn’t matter what concession [shop] you go into, one’s better than the next one — they’re all just amazing. Take food: you can’t just have a food hall anymore, you have to have restaurants. Look at David Simon [head of Simon Properties]: everyone asks why his stock is so high. It’s because he reinvents himself all the time. He never gets stale. So when you go into a Simon mall, it’s busier than everyone else’s because he’s constantly looking at the best brands and reshuffling things. I don’t think the mall is dead. I think the mall is very alive — if you’re in the right malls. And I don’t think the department store is dead. It just needs to be reinvented. Now, are we over-retailed in America? The answer is yes. That’s why going online is critical. If you want to be in this business, you’ve got to go where the customers go. WWD: There’s a lot of criticism about the licensing model. Why are you so enamored with it? J.S.: There are two types of licensing. One really comes out of the animation business. Look at Disney: it’s the greatest company in the world. And what do they do? They make movies. They make TV shows. Then they have the parks where they sell you a lot of merchandise. I’ve got that same attitude. Authentic has content and experiences and if we continue to do that, we can license our brands and be successful. If you’re just brand slapping and there’s no meat behind it, I think you will die a slow death. You have to treat your brands like your children. You can’t give them back. If you don’t constantly maintain your brands, you’re not going to win. And I think that’s where licensing gets a bad reputation. Disney has done an unbelievable job — we think they’re the best of the best of the best. They’re number one, we’re number two, and they’re way above us. But we’re working hard every single day to continue to make this a better place. Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

It counts 1,800 licensing partners globally, and its licensees operate 16,000 stores and 29,000 shops-in-shop around the world. The group is by far the largest of what is a new wave of brand management companies, which are rewriting the fashion and retail landscape in the U.S. by snapping up brand seemingly every week. While it’s a model that first emerged in the U.S. almost 50 years ago, Authentic and the likes of WHP Global, Bluestar and Marquee Brands are now taking it to another level. Here, Salter talks about his journey, how he’s built Authentic and his plans to pass the reins to the newly named president, Matt Maddox, within the next two years. WWD: How has the licensing model evolved since you started 15 years ago? Jamie Salter: It’s dramatically different. When we came into the business, Iconix was really the prize in the industry. It was doing DTR [direct-to-retail] with big retailers, and it was very item driven and category specific. When I looked at the business back then, I always asked the question, “Why don’t they sell home and shoes and whatever?” Well, it wasn’t because they didn’t want to, but they had a DTR [strategy]. So I said, OK, I know they’re doing really well, but that’s not going to work for us. We have to have another angle on how can we do well in the licensing business. So we took a different approach. WWD: And what was that? J.S.: Our approach was we’re going to go after wholesalers, and we’re going to do it by category and by territory, and they’re going to have to sell into retailers. That was very different from what Iconix was doing. So you could say we got lucky, or you could say we’re smart. I would say it’s probably a little bit of both. But what it really proved to me was you could actually grow the businesses so much bigger. WWD: Was there a downside? J.S.: You could argue our model was more expensive to run than a traditional licensing model, because we had to put a lot of money from the royalties that we were collecting into marketing. In the beginning, we weren’t putting enough into the marketing side of the business, but we learned very early on — when my partner Nick [Woodhouse] came into the business — that we really had to spend money on marketing. But we couldn’t afford it. It was hard. WWD: But I assume you decided to make the investment? J.S.: I met a guy named Adam Kronengold who is still with me today. He’s our chief digital officer. He was one of our first employees and in his interview, he asked me how many social media followers I had. I said, “What do you mean? Me? Jamie Salter?” He said, “No, not you, your company.” I said, “I don’t really understand the question.” So he goes on Instagram and says, “You don’t have an account.” This is in 2010, and he said, “Marilyn Monroe has an account. She has 250,000 followers. You know you can talk to people, post stuff and market.” I said, “How much does that cost?” He says, “It’s free. You can put up a post, send your message and tell people where Marilyn Monroe is being sold. You can do whatever you want. It’s your channel.” WWD: Guess he convinced you. J.S.: I asked him how Instagram made money and he said it didn’t make a lot then, but their whole strategy was to get everybody on social media and eventually turn it into an advertising platform. I said, “I like free — you’re hired.” So we were one of the very early adopters in the social media world. I think that is really the base of Authentic Brands — we really built the company like a tech start-up. Here we are 15 years after and we’re still like a start-up in the way we think. We’re always on the cusp of what’s next. WWD: How do you differ from the other brand management companies you compete with today like WHP Global, Marquee Brands and Bluestar? J.S.: We welcome competition, and we want them to do well, because if they do well, it’s good for us. But everyone builds a niche for themselves. WHP is using the Iconix/Sequential playbook and they’ve transitioned from that a little bit. I think Yehuda [Shmidman, WHP’s chief executive officer] learned some good hard lessons through his experience there and he’s building a pretty good platform [at WHP]. But scale matters now in this business because of the money you have to spend in order to build these brands and keep them relevant in the marketplace. We have a big international platform and nobody else really has that. But where we’re really separate from them is that we have 80 people in the marketing department today, we have 700 million social media followers — that’s 10 percent of the people that live on the planet. We’re on TikTok and WeChat and Instagram and Red Note — we’re on every platform around the globe. We have social media influencers in 150 different languages. WWD: Is that why you’re often always the first call when a brand is for sale? J.S.: If you have an opportunity to partner with Authentic versus Bluestar versus WHP, you’re going to partner with Authentic if it’s the same economics, just because it’s a much bigger platform. We can actually pay more because our platform is so efficient. And we can run businesses more efficiently because of our sheer size. WWD: You swooped in at the last minute to buy Guess even though WHP already had a deal. What happened there? J.S.: They always say anything’s for sale for the right price. But that’s just not true. [Guess cofounder] Paul Marciano was looking for a partner and unless he got the best deal for his shareholders, he would never have sold the company. So he’s selling 51 percent to us, and the family [with CEO Carlos Alberini] will own other 49 percent. Relationships matter, strategy matters, legacy matters. Paul’s last name is on the door. Look at LVMH: the family is all involved in the business and I think that’s why it’s such an incredible company. They learned from their father and they care — the legacy lives on. My name is on the door too — Authentic is the Salters. My family will be involved with Authentic Brands forever, I hope. WWD: All four of your sons are in the business, right? J.S.: Yes. And at some point, Jamie Salter will have to hang up the skates as I get older. WWD: In January, you brought in Matt Maddox, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, as president. What is his role? J.S.: He worked with Steve Wynn for 22 years and for the last four or five years, was CEO of Wynn Properties. Everyone asked me why I didn’t hire someone from the fashion business. Look, we’re in the licensing business, which means we’re effectively a landlord. We buy these great brands, we fix them up, we market them and we rent out rooms. And the rooms happen to be shoes and socks and intimate apparel and home goods. And we do that by territory, by category. Matt understood the retail luxury space, because he has his own mall at the Wynn. He understood that he has to rent out his rooms every day. He has to market. He understood the entertainment business and events and celebrities and athletes. He has relationships with all these. We knew a lot of the same people and were partners with the Wynn through our live events division. WWD: Sounds like a good match. J.S.: Matt was offered some of the biggest jobs in the United States and initially he said no to me [when I offered him the job]. I asked him why and he said, “I’ve looked at your business. It’s working really well. You’re doing an incredible job. You’re not going anywhere. You don’t need me.” So I called Steve [Wynn] and told him he had to convince Matt to take the job. He did and we hired Matt. WWD: What are your ultimate plans for Matt? J.S.: I made a commitment to Matt that he would become the CEO of the company in the next two years. I will move to executive chairman. And you know, people ask me, “Are you OK with that?” Well, I’m super excited. Matt is 49, he’s young, he’s beyond smart. He’s working incredibly well with the team. He’s working great with my children, which is really important to me. He’s mentoring my son, Corey, who, you know, I ultimately want one day to run the company with his brothers. But I’ve got an incredible partner in Matt, who I believe will lead Authentic to $100 billion. WWD: The business community is filled with founders who find they can’t actually step aside when they turn over the reins to someone else. Why is this different? J.S.: Like I told Matt, I’m not going anywhere. But we’ve got to stay young; we’ve got to stay nimble. He understands the loyalty side of the business better than me because they had a big loyalty program at the Wynn. He understands the digital side of the business. He’s doing an unbelievable job upgrading Authentic on the process side. And if we do decide to go public over the next year or two, he’ll be an excellent CEO that the Street can rely on. I’m excited to just continue doing what I’m really good at, which is building great relationships around the world and working on the M&A side, and I have a great partner in Matt to run the day-to-day. WWD: Sounds like hiring someone from outside the fashion industry is working out for you. J.S.: I’m a big believer in hiring outside the industry — not that we don’t hire inside the industry, because we still need merchants and great marketing people. But if you really look at Authentic, the average age here is about 35. And they come out of the digital space, the legal space, the finance system. Authentic is a big marketing department, a big legal department, a big digital department. So, we’re hiring people from Meta and Google and Microsoft and Amazon. You still need merchants to touch and feel and make great product, because you can have the greatest digital team and the greatest marketing team but if don’t have good product, then it doesn’t work. But at the end of the day, data is everything. WWD: What do you look for when you’re hiring people? J.S.: When you’re hot, you attract great talent. When I’m hiring someone, the first question I ask is, can AI do this job? If the answer is no, the second question is: is that person smarter than you? And we’re a loyal group, so if you’re really good, you’re going to be here forever. But Authentic is not for everyone. Do not come here if you’re looking for a 9-to-5 job because we work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We’re a global company, so we’re always working. With the globalization of the world, the internet, social media, the news cycles and staying ahead of trends and culture, you always have to be on. WWD: You also have other components to your business beyond brand management. J.S.: Yes. Twenty-five percent of the platform is entertainment. [Our competitors] don’t have an entertainment business. And entertainment, in my opinion, drives fashion culture. The entertainment business is really music culture and sports culture, which is where we have a big edge. The other 75 percent of our turnover is rooted in the lifestyle space. WWD: How do you evolve the company going forward, where are the opportunities? J.S.: We think we’re just scratching the surface. I know people think that’s kind of crazy with a business that has about $32 billion in annual retail systemwide sales. But we think we can be about $100 billion within the next five years. It’s not as crazy as you think when we pull off deals like Guess, which does $6 billion at retail. There are lots of other brands that are in that $1 billion to $10 billion range that we could buy. And we really, truly believe that we will crack those opportunities. Over the next five years, we’ll do another four or five big deals and that’s another $50 billion. This year alone, and the year is not over, we added almost $7 billion in revenue. WWD: You were close to going public a couple of years ago and then decided against it. Are you revisiting the idea? J.S.: Authentic is a very different model. We trade like a tech company because we are a tech company. Think about it. When you have 75 percent margin, 99 percent cash conversion and virtually no capex, you trade like a software company. So could we be public? The answer is yes. Should we be public? I don’t know. There’s no need to be. Why is SpaceX not public? It doesn’t need to be. We trade at a very high multiple; we have 36 percent growth in the company. We’re low levered. We took our first money from Leonard Green in 2010 and the company has been self-funded since then. WWD: But you have other investors including General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, Simon Property Group and Brookfield, among others. J.S.: True. There’s been $9 billion of secondaries in the last three years, but that’s just one shareholder selling to a new buyer. There’s been no need for investment from outside. We actually just bought $1 billion of stock back and retired the shares, so the company’s very flush with cash. WWD: A lot of the brands you buy are distressed. Is that what you look for? J.S.: The brands aren’t necessarily distressed, the companies are. Reebok wasn’t a bad brand. Adidas just wasn’t putting the effort into one of the greatest athletic brands in the world. Their focus was on building Adidas. They milked Reebok as far as they possibly could, and they didn’t need it anymore. We’ve owned Reebok now for a couple years and we’ve almost doubled the business. We still have lots of work to do, but Reebok is a $6 billion business and our ambition is to grow to a $10 billion business over the next three years — and we feel very confident we’re going to get there. WWD: So what is the criteria you use when exploring a purchase? J.S.: A good brand but a broken business. Champion wasn’t broken but Hanes needed liquidity. Truth be told, I spoke to Gildan before we bought Champion. I said, “Let’s go buy Hanes together. I’ll take Champion. You take Hanes.” We ended up buying Champion. They ended up buying Hanes, which is interesting. We could have done the deal together. Anyway, our model is to license by category, by territory, to best-in-class partners. So you get the best underwear-maker, you get the best sock-maker, you get the best sportswear-maker. It means the business grows much quicker. But we have to unwind the overhead so we can run these companies much more efficiently. People always say, “When you buy a company, all the jobs go away.” It’s not true — lots of new jobs are created. When we look at our portfolio, I would say that probably 75 percent of the jobs either stay or new jobs are created. So maybe people lose their jobs in California, but there are new jobs in New York, and it’s more efficient. WWD: Where do you see the growth coming from in the future? J.S.: Entertainment and kids’ animation. Those are two really big areas for us. We believe entertainment really does drive lifestyle. So we’re going to continue to drive that. And when I say the kids’ space, think Disney, think Mattel, that type of stuff. And with Matt’s background, we’re moving into the hospitality business. We’ve done multiple deals now for hotels and condos. We have the Barneys hotel. We have Sports Illustrated resorts, we have Eddie Bauer lodges. We have Nautica condos going up in Mexico. Our hospitality business is bigger than you would think. Also, beauty. Our beauty business is over a couple billion dollars today, but there’s big opportunity there. And you’re going to see us do more deals like David Beckham and Shaq. WWD: Speaking of Beckham and Shaquille O’Neal, neither of them has been playing for a while. And you also own the rights to Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, who are dead. J.S.: We don’t call them dead — they’re icons, and with AI coming into play, Marilyn Monroe is going to be on fire in 2026, which is her 100th anniversary [of her birth]. We’ve done an enormous number of deals around Marilyn Monroe. And don’t be surprised if you see her in movies again. And look at what’s going on with Elvis Presley. There was the movie and we now have an immersive theater production, Elvis Evolution, at the 02 in London. WWD: But how do you appeal to young people who don’t know Elvis and never saw Shaq or David Beckham play? J.S.: Shaq has never been bigger — no pun intended. Shaq’s business is 10 times as big as when we partnered with him in 2015. And David Beckham‘s business has doubled since we joined forces Now, we’ve only been working on David’s business for a couple years — Shaq’s we’ve owned much longer. I’m not going to say live celebrities are better, but there are bigger opportunities than if they’re not with us anymore. WWD: Let’s talk about the Authentic Luxury Group. Can you explain what that is and how it’s working? J.S.: ALG is a joint venture between Saks Global and us that licenses the IP of the Saks brands and select Authentic premium brands. Richard [Baker, executive chairman of Saks Global] has had a bit of a bumpy road. He is a total optimist and a great visionary, but he needs to prove to the world that financially, he’s set up properly. It seems he’s on the right track now but we’re going to continue to be careful. We’re going to continue to build the affordable luxury — or premium — side of our business. Luxury is a word you have to be careful with. LVMH is luxury, Kering is luxury, Prada is luxury. Vince is premium, Brooks Brothers is premium, Hugo Boss is premium. We’ll continue to play in the premium space in a big way, because it’s the next level from where we are today. We have the full support of Saks, Neiman’s and Amazon, because that’s the joint venture, and we’ll fully support Richard and his journey. But we’re going to be careful. WWD: Are you still looking to buy Marc Jacobs? J.S.: I can’t really comment on that. What I will tell you is we will continue to look at companies in that space, like Marc Jacobs, and we’ll see where it goes. WWD: Let’s talk about the whole department store and retail space where you have a lot of partners. It’s not easy out there. J.S.: We have to go where the customers go. If T.J. Maxx is a winner, we’ve got to sell them. if Burlington, Target and Walmart are winners, we’ve got to sell them. The consumption is the same as it was a year ago — people aren’t buying any less product. They’re just buying from different places. So we continue to go where the customers go, and that’s really been our model. We think independent retailers, or omnichannel retailers like Lucky or Brooks Brothers, are actually important to building these brands. It’s tough, but it’s important to the model. Today, we have about 6,000 licensed full-price/outlet stores around the globe. And then there are another 24,000 shops-in-shop. So when you really look at our portfolio, half of our volume is done through stores that have our name above the door, and that’s a big investment. It’s going to take a long time before Kohl’s and JCPenney and Macy’s are not here anymore. But they’ve got to continue to reinvent themselves. Great retailers survive. Look at Harrods: it’s packed wall-to-wall all the time. WWD: Why do you think that is? J.S.: It may be the model: a department store made up of all concessions. It doesn’t matter what concession [shop] you go into, one’s better than the next one — they’re all just amazing. Take food: you can’t just have a food hall anymore, you have to have restaurants. Look at David Simon [head of Simon Properties]: everyone asks why his stock is so high. It’s because he reinvents himself all the time. He never gets stale. So when you go into a Simon mall, it’s busier than everyone else’s because he’s constantly looking at the best brands and reshuffling things. I don’t think the mall is dead. I think the mall is very alive — if you’re in the right malls. And I don’t think the department store is dead. It just needs to be reinvented. Now, are we over-retailed in America? The answer is yes. That’s why going online is critical. If you want to be in this business, you’ve got to go where the customers go. WWD: There’s a lot of criticism about the licensing model. Why are you so enamored with it? J.S.: There are two types of licensing. One really comes out of the animation business. Look at Disney: it’s the greatest company in the world. And what do they do? They make movies. They make TV shows. Then they have the parks where they sell you a lot of merchandise. I’ve got that same attitude. Authentic has content and experiences and if we continue to do that, we can license our brands and be successful. If you’re just brand slapping and there’s no meat behind it, I think you will die a slow death. You have to treat your brands like your children. You can’t give them back. If you don’t constantly maintain your brands, you’re not going to win. And I think that’s where licensing gets a bad reputation. Disney has done an unbelievable job — we think they’re the best of the best of the best. They’re number one, we’re number two, and they’re way above us. But we’re working hard every single day to continue to make this a better place. Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: The Case Against Generative AI

Full Content:
Soundtrack: Queens of the Stone Age - First It Giveth Before we go any further: This is, for the third time this year, the longest newsletter I've ever written, weighing in somewhere around 18,500 words. I've written it specifically to be read at your leisure — dip in and out where you'd like — but also in one go. This is my comprehensive case that yes, we’re in a bubble, one that will inevitably (and violently) collapse in the near future. I'll also be cutting this into a four-part episode starting tomorrow on my podcast Better Offline. I deeply appreciate your time. If you like this newsletter, please think about subscribing to the premium, which I write weekly. Thanks for reading. Alright, let’s do this one last time. In 2022, a (kind-of) company called OpenAI surprised the world with a website called ChatGPT that could generate text that sort-of sounded like a person using a technology called Large Language Models (LLMs), which can also be used to generate images, video and computer code. Large Language Models require entire clusters of servers connected with high-speed networking, all containing this thing called a GPU — graphics processing units. These are different to the GPUs in your Xbox, or laptop, or gaming PC. They cost much, much more, and they’re good at doing the processes of inference (the creation of the output of any LLM) and training (feeding masses of training data to models, or feeding them information about what a good output might look like, so they can later identify a thing or replicate it). These models showed some immediate promise in their ability to articulate concepts or generate video, visuals, audio, text and code. They also immediately had one glaring, obvious problem: because they’re probabilistic, these models can’t actually be relied upon to do the same thing every single time. So, if you generated a picture of a person that you wanted to, for example, use in a story book, every time you created a new page, using the same prompt to describe the protagonist, that person would look different — and that difference could be minor (something that a reader should shrug off), or it could make that character look like a completely different person. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of generative AI meant that whenever you asked it a question, it would guess as to the answer, not because it knew the answer, but rather because it was guessing on the right word to add in a sentence based on previous training data. As a result, these models would frequently make mistakes — something which we later referred to as “hallucinations.” And that’s not even mentioning the cost of training these models, the cost of running them, the vast amounts of computational power they required, the fact that the legality of using material scraped from books and the web without the owner’s permission was (and remains) legally dubious, or the fact that nobody seemed to know how to use these models to actually create profitable businesses. These problems were overshadowed by something flashy, and new, and something that investors — and the tech media — believed would eventually automate the single thing that’s proven most resistant to automation: namely, knowledge work and the creative economy. This newness and hype and these expectations sent the market into a frenzy, with every hyperscaler immediately creating the most aggressive market for one supplier I’ve ever seen. NVIDIA has sold over $200 billion of GPUs since the beginning of 2023, becoming the largest company on the stock market and trading at over $170 as of writing this sentence only a few years after being worth $19.52 a share. While I’ve talked about some of the propelling factors behind the AI wave — automation and novelty — that’s not a complete picture. A huge reason why everybody decided to “do AI” was because the software industry’s growth was slowing, with SaaS (Software As A Service) company valuations stalling or dropping, resulting in the terrifying prospect of companies having to “under promise and over deliver” and “be efficient.” Things that normal companies — those whose valuations aren’t contingent on ever-increasing, ever-constant growth — don’t have to worry about, because they’re normal companies. Suddenly, there was the promise of a new technology — Large Language Models — that were getting exponentially more powerful, which was mostly a lie but hard to disprove because “powerful” can mean basically anything, and the definition of “powerful” depended entirely on whoever you asked at any given time, and what that person’s motivations were. The media also immediately started tripping on its own feet, mistakenly claiming OpenAI’s GPT-4 model tricked a Taskrabbit into solving a CAPTCHA (it didn’t — this never happened), or saying that “people who don’t know how to code already [used] bots to produce full-fledged games,” and if you’re wondering what “full-fledged” means, it means “pong” and a cobbled-together rolling demo of SkyRoads, a game from 1993. The media (and investors) helped peddle the narrative that AI was always getting better, could do basically anything, and that any problems you saw today would be inevitably solved in a few short months, or years, or, well, at some point I guess. LLMs were touted as a digital panacea, and the companies building them offered traditional software companies the chance to plug these models into their software using an API, thus allowing them to ride the same generative AI wave that every other company was riding. The model companies similarly started going after individual and business customers, offering software and subscriptions that promised the world, though this mostly boiled down to chatbots that could generate stuff, and then doubled down with the promise of “agents” — a marketing term that’s meant to make you think “autonomous digital worker” but really means “broken digital product.” Throughout this era, investors and the media spoke with a sense of inevitability that they never really backed up with data. It was an era based on confidently-asserted “vibes.” Everything was always getting better and more powerful, even though there was never much proof that this was truly disruptive technology, other than in its ability to disrupt apps you were using with AI — making them worse by, for example, suggesting questions on every Facebook post that you could ask Meta AI, but which Meta AI couldn’t answer. “AI” was omnipresent, and it eventually grew to mean everything and nothing. OpenAI would see its every move lorded over like a gifted child, its CEO Sam Altman called the “Oppenheimer of Our Age,” even if it wasn’t really obvious why everyone was impressed. GPT-4 felt like something a bit different, but was it actually meaningful? The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is built and sold on not just faith, but a series of myths that the AI boosters expect us to believe with the same certainty that we treat things like gravity, or the boiling point of water. Can large language models actually replace coders? Not really, no, and I’ll get into why later in the piece. Can Sora — OpenAI’s video creation tool — replace actors or animators? No, not at all, but it still fills the air full of tension because you can immediately see who is pre-registered to replace everyone that works for them. AI is apparently replacing workers, but nobody appears to be able to prove it! But every few weeks a story runs where everybody tries to pretend that AI is replacing workers with some poorly-sourced and incomprehensible study, never actually saying “someone’s job got replaced by AI” because it isn’t happening at scale, and because if you provide real-world examples, people can actually check. To be clear, some people have lost jobs to AI, just not the white collar workers, software engineers, or really any of the career paths that the mainstream media and AI investors would have you believe. Brian Merchant has done excellent work covering how LLMs have devoured the work of translators, using cheap, “almost good” automation to lower already-stagnant wages in a field that was already hurting before the advent of generative AI, with some having to abandon the field, and others pushed into bankruptcy. I’ve heard the same for art directors, SEO experts, and copy editors, and Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal covered these last year. These are all fields with something in common: shitty bosses with little regard for their customers who have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to slash contract labor. To quote Merchant, “the drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of ‘powerful AI’ encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have.” Across the board, the people being “replaced” by AI are the victims of lazy, incompetent cost-cutters who don’t care if they ship poorly-translated text. To quote Merchant again, “[AI hype] has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting “good enough” automation output for video games and media products.” Yet the jobs crisis facing translators speaks to the larger flaws of the Large Language Model era, and why other careers aren’t seeing this kind of disruption. Generative AI creates outputs, and by extension defines all labor as some kind of output created from a request. In the case of translation, it’s possible for a company to get by with a shitty version, because many customers see translation as “what do these words say,” even though (as one worker told Merchant) translation is about conveying meaning. Nevertheless, “translation” work had already started to condense to a world where humans would at times clean up machine-generated text, and the same worker warned that the same might come for other industries. Yet the problem is that translation is a heavily output-driven industry, one where (idiot) bosses can say “oh yeah that’s fine” because they ran an output back through Google Translate and it seemed fine in their native tongue. The problems of a poor translation are obvious, but the customers of translation are, it seems, often capable of getting by with a shitty product. The problem is that most jobs are not output-driven at all, and what we’re buying from a human being is a person’s ability to think. Every CEO talking about AI replacing workers is an example of the real problem: that most companies are run by people who don’t understand or experience the problems they’re solving, don’t do any real work, don’t face any real problems, and thus can never be trusted to solve them. The Era of the Business Idiot is the result of letting management consultants and neoliberal “free market” sociopaths take over everything, leaving us with companies run by people who don’t know how the companies make money, just that they must always make more. When you’re a big, stupid asshole, every job that you see is condensed to its outputs, and not the stuff that leads up to the output, or the small nuances and conscious decisions that make an output good as opposed to simply acceptable, or even bad. What does a software engineer do? They write code! What does a writer do? They write words! What does a hairdresser do? They cut hair! Yet that’s not actually the case. As I’ll get into later, a software engineer does far more than just code, and when they write code they’re not just saying “what would solve this problem?” with a big smile on their face — they’re taking into account their years of experience, what code does, what code could do, all the things that might break as a result, and all of the things that you can’t really tell from just looking at code, like whether there’s a reason things are made in a particular way. A good coder doesn’t just hammer at the keyboard with the aim of doing a particular task. They factor in questions like: How does this functionality fit into the code that’s already here? Or, if someone has to update this code in the future, how do I make it easy for them to understand what I’ve written and to make changes without breaking a bunch of other stuff? A writer doesn’t just “write words.” They jostle ideas and ideals and emotions and thoughts and facts and feelings into a condensed piece of text, explaining both what’s happening and why it’s happening from their perspective, finding nuanced ways to convey large topics, none of which is the result of a single (or many) prompts but the ever-shifting sand of a writer’s brain. Good writing is a fight between a bunch of different factors: structure, style, intent, audience, and prioritizing the things that you (or your client) care about in the text. It’s often emotive — or at the very least, driven or inspired by a given emotion — which is something that an AI simply can’t replicate in a way that’s authentic and believable. And a hairdresser doesn’t just cut hair, but cuts your hair, which may be wiry, dry, oily, long, short, healthy, unhealthy, on a scalp with particular issues, at a time of year when perhaps you want to change length, at a time that fits you, in “the way you like” which may be impossible to actually write down but they get it just right. And they make conversation, making you feel at ease while they snip and clip away at your tresses, with you having to trust that they’ll get it right. This is the true nature of labor that executives fail to comprehend at scale: that the things we do are not units of work, but extrapolations of experience, emotion, and context that cannot be condensed in written meaning. Business Idiots see our labor as the result of a smart manager saying “do this,” rather than human ingenuity interpreting both a request and the shit the manager didn’t say. What does a CEO do? Uhhh, um, well, a Harvard study says they spend 25% of their time on “people and relationships,” 25% on “functional and business unit reviews,” 16% on “organization and culture,” and 21% on “strategy,” with a few percent here and there for things like “professional development.” That’s who runs the vast majority of companies: people that describe their work predominantly as “looking at stuff,” “talking to people” and “thinking about what we do next.” The most highly-paid jobs in the world are impossible to describe, their labor described in a mish-mash of LinkedInspiraton, yet everybody else’s labor is an output that can be automated. As a result, Large Language Models seem like magic. When you see everything as an outcome — an outcome you may or may not understand, and definitely don’t understand the process behind, let alone care about — you kind of already see your workers as LLMs. You create a stratification of the workforce that goes beyond the normal organizational chart, with senior executives — those closer to the class level of CEO — acting as those who have risen above the doldrums of doing things to the level of “decisionmaking,” a fuzzy term that can mean everything from “making nuanced decisions with input from multiple different subject-matter experts” to, as ServiceNow Bill McDermott did in 2022, “[make] it clear to everybody [in a boardroom of other executives], everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.” The same extends to some members of the business and tech media that have, for the most part, gotten by without having to think too hard about the actual things the companies are saying. I realize this sounds a little mean, and I must be clear it doesn’t mean that these people know nothing, just that it’s been possible to scoot through the world without thinking too hard about whether or not something is true. When Salesforce said back in 2024 that its “Einstein Trust Layer” and AI would be “transformational for jobs,” the media dutifully wrote it down and published it without a second thought. It fully trusted Marc Benioff when he said that Agentforce agents would replace human workers, and then again when he said that AI agents are doing “30% to 50% of all the work in Salesforce itself,” even though that’s an unproven and nakedly ridiculous statement. Salesforce’s CFO said earlier this year that AI wouldn’t boost sales growth in 2025. One would think this would change how they’re covered, or how seriously one takes Marc Benioff. It hasn’t, because nobody is paying attention. In fact, nobody seems to be doing their job. This is how the core myths of generative AI were built: by executives saying stuff and the media publishing it without thinking too hard. AI is replacing workers! AI is writing entire computer programs! AI is getting exponentially more-powerful! What does “powerful” mean? That the models are getting better on benchmarks that are rigged in their favor, but because nobody fucking explains it, regular people are regularly told that AI is “powerful.” The only thing “powerful” about generative AI is its mythology. The world’s executives, entirely disconnected from labor and actual production, are doing the only thing they know how to — spend a bunch of money and say vague stuff about “AI being the future.” There are people — journalists, investors, and analysts — that have built entire careers on filling in the gaps for the powerful as they splurge billions of dollars and repeat with increasing desperation that “the future is here” as absolutely nothing happens. You’ve likely seen a few ridiculous headlines recently. One of the most recent, and most absurd, is that that OpenAI will pay Oracle $300 billion over four years, closely followed with the claim that NVIDIA will “invest” “$100 billion” in OpenAI to build 10GW of AI data centers, though the deal is structured in a way that means that OpenAI is paid “progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” and OpenAI will be leasing the chips (rather than buying them outright). I must be clear that these deals are intentionally made to continue the myth of generative AI, to pump NVIDIA, and to make sure OpenAI insiders can sell $10.3 billion of shares. OpenAI cannot afford the $300 billion, NVIDIA hasn’t sent OpenAI a cent and won’t do so if it can’t build the data centers, which OpenAI most assuredly can’t afford to do. NVIDIA needs this myth to continue, because in truth, all of these data centers are being built for demand that doesn’t exist, or that — if it exists — doesn’t necessarily translate into business customers paying huge amounts for access to OpenAI’s generative AI services. NVIDIA, OpenAI, CoreWeave and other AI-related companies hope that by announcing theoretical billions of dollars (or hundreds of billions of dollars) of these strange, vague and impossible-seeming deals, they can keep pretending that demand is there, because why else would they build all of these data centers, right? That, and the entire stock market rests on NVIDIA’s back. It accounts for 7% to 8% of the value of the S&P 500, and Jensen Huang needs to keep selling GPUs. I intend to explain later on how all of this works, and how brittle it really is. The intention of these deals is simple: to make you think “this much money can’t be wrong.” It can. These people need you to believe this is inevitable, but they are being proven wrong, again and again, and today I’m going to continue doing so. Underpinning these stories about huge amounts of money and endless opportunity lies a dark secret — that none of this is working, and all of this money has been invested in a technology that doesn’t make much revenue and loves to burn millions or billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. Over half a trillion dollars has gone into an entire industry without a single profitable company developing models or products built on top of models. By my estimates, there is around $44 billion of revenue in generative AI this year (when you add in Anthropic and OpenAI’s revenues to the pot, along with the other stragglers) and most of that number has been gathered through reporting from outlets like The Information, because none of these companies share their revenues, all of them lose shit tons of money, and their actual revenues are really, really small. Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue — Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported “$13 billion in annualized revenue,” so around $1.083 billion a month. Microsoft is a sales MACHINE. It is built specifically to create or exploit software markets, suffocating competitors by using its scale to drive down prices, and to leverage the ecosystem that it’s created over the past few decades. $1 billion a month in revenue is chump change for an organization that makes over $27 billion a quarter in PROFITS. Don’t worry Satya, I’ll come back to you later. “But Ed, the early days!” Worry not — I’ve got that covered. This is nothing like any other era of tech. There has never been this kind of cash-rush, even in the fiber boom. Over a decade, Amazon spent about one-tenth of the capex that the Magnificent Seven spent in two years on generative AI building AWS — something that now powers a vast chunk of the web, and has long been Amazon’s most profitable business unit. Generative AI is nothing like Uber, with OpenAI and Anthropic’s true costs coming in at about $159 billion in the past two years, approaching five times Uber’s $30 billion all-time burn. And that’s before the bullshit with NVIDIA and Oracle. Microsoft last reported AI revenue in January. It’s October this week. Why did it stop reporting this number, you think? Is it because the numbers are so good it couldn’t possibly let people know? As a general rule, publicly traded companies — especially those where the leadership are compensated primarily in equity — tend to brag about their successes, in part because said bragging boosts the value of the thing that the leadership gets paid in. There’s no benefit to being shy. Oracle literally made a regulatory filing to boast it had a $30 billion customer, which turned out to be OpenAI, who eventually agreed (publicly) to spend $300 billion in compute over five years. Which is to say that Microsoft clearly doesn’t have any good news to share, and as I’ll reveal later, they can’t even get 3% of their 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot. If Microsoft can’t sell this shit, nobody can. Anyway, I’m nearly done, sorry, you see, I’m writing this whole thing as if you’re brand new and walking up to this relatively unprepared, so I need to introduce another company. In 2020, a splinter group jumped off of OpenAI, funded by Amazon and Google to do much the same thing as OpenAI but pretend to be nicer about it until they have to raise from the Middle East. Anthropic has always been better at coding for some reason, and people really like its Claude models. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have become the only two companies in generative AI to make any real progress, either in terms of recognition or in sheer commercial terms, accounting for the majority of the revenue in the AI industry. In a very real sense, the AI industry’s revenue is OpenAI and Anthropic. In the year where Microsoft recorded $13bn in AI revenues, $10 billion came from OpenAI’s spending on Microsoft Azure. Anthropic burned $5.3 billion last year — with the vast majority of that going towards compute. Outside of these two companies, there’s barely enough revenue to justify a single data center. Where we sit today is a time of immense tension. Mark Zuckerberg says we’re in a bubble, Sam Altman says we’re in a bubble, Alibaba Chairman and billionaire Joe Tsai says we’re in a bubble, Apollo says we’re in a bubble, nobody is making money and nobody knows why they’re actually doing this anymore, just that they must do it immediately. And they have yet to make the case that generative AI warranted any of these expenditures. That was undoubtedly the longest introduction to a newsletter I’ve ever written, and the reason why I took my time was because this post demands a level of foreshadowing and exposition, and because I want to make it make sense to anyone who reads it — whether they’ve read my newsletter for years, or whether they’re only just now investigating their suspicions that generative AI may not be all it’s cracked up to be. Today I will make the case that generative AI’s fundamental growth story is flawed, and explain why we’re in the midst of an egregious bubble. This industry is sold by keeping things vague, and knowing that most people don’t dig much deeper than a headline, a problem I simply do not have. This industry is effectively in service of two companies — OpenAI and NVIDIA — who pump headlines out through endless contracts between them and subsidiaries or investments to give the illusion of activity. OpenAI is now, at this point, on the hook for over a trillion dollars, an egregious sum for a company that already forecast billions in losses, with no clear explanation as to how it’ll afford any of this beyond “we need more money” and the vague hope that there’s another Softbank or Microsoft waiting in the wings to swoop in and save the day. I’m going to walk you through where I see this industry today, and why I see no future for it beyond a fiery apocalypse. While everybody (reasonably!) harps on about hallucinations — which, to remind you, is when a model authoritatively states something that isn’t true — but the truth is far more complex, and far worse than it seems. You cannot rely on a large language model to do what you want. Even the most highly-tuned models on the most expensive and intricate platform can’t actually be relied upon to do exactly what you want. A “hallucination” isn’t just when these models say something that isn’t true. It’s when they decide to do something wrong because it seems the most likely thing to do, or when a coding model decides to go on a wild goose chase, failing the user and burning a ton of money in the process. The advent of “reasoning” models — those engineered to ‘think’ through problems in a way reminiscent of a human — and the expansion of what people are (trying) to use LLMs for demands that the definition of an AI hallucination be widened, not merely referring to factual errors, but fundamental errors in understanding the user’s request or intent, or what constitutes a task, in part because these models cannot think and do not know anything. However successful a model might be in generating something good *once*, it will also often generate something bad, or it’ll generate the right thing but in an inefficient and over-verbose fashion. You do not know what you’re going to get each time, and hallucinations multiply with the complexity of the thing you’re asking for, or whether a task contains multiple steps (which is a fatal blow to the idea of “agents.” You can add as many levels of intrigue and “reasoning” as you want, but Large Language Models cannot be trusted to do something correctly, or even consistently, every time. Model companies have successfully convinced everybody that the issue is that users are prompting the models wrong, and that people need to be “trained to use AI,” but what they’re doing is training people to explain away the inconsistencies of Large Language Models, and to assume individual responsibility for what is an innate flaw in how large language models work. Large Language Models are also uniquely expensive. Many mistakenly try and claim this is like the dot com boom or Uber, but the basic unit economics of generative AI are insane. Providers must purchase tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs each costing $50,000 a piece, and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of infrastructure for large clusters. And that’s without mentioning things like staffing, construction, power, or water. Then you turn them on and start losing money. Despite hundreds of billions of GPUs sold, nobody seems to make any money, other than NVIDIA, the company that makes them, and resellers like Dell and Supermicro who buy the GPUs, put them in servers, and sell them to other people. This arrangement works out great for Jensen Huang, and terribly for everybody else. I am going to explain the insanity of the situation we find ourselves in, and why I continue to do this work undeterred. The bubble has entered its most pornographic, aggressive and destructive stage, where the more obvious it becomes that they’re cooked, the more ridiculous the generative AI industry will act — a dark juxtaposition against every new study that says “generative AI does not work” or new story about ChatGPT’s uncanny ability to activate mental illness in people. So, let’s start simple: NVIDIA is a hardware company that sells GPUs, including the consumer GPUs that you’d see in a modern gaming PC, but when you read someone say “GPU” within the context of AI, they mean enterprise-focused GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and more modern GPUs like the Blackwell-series B200 and GB200 (which combines two GPUs with an NVIDIA CPU). These GPUs cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 (or as high as $70,000 for the newer Blackwell GPUs), and require tens of thousands of dollars more of infrastructure — networking to “cluster” server racks of GPUs together to provide compute, and massive cooling systems to deal with the massive amounts of heat they produce, as well as the servers themselves that they run on, which typically use top-of-the-line data center CPUs, and contain vast quantities of high-speed memory and storage. While the GPU itself is likely the most expensive single item within an AI server, the other costs — and I’m not even factoring in the actual physical building that the server lives in, or the water or electricity that it uses — add up. I’ve mentioned NVIDIA because it has a virtual monopoly in this space. Generative AI effectively requires NVIDIA GPUs, in part because it’s the only company really making the kinds of high-powered cards that generative AI demands, and because NVIDIA created something called CUDA — a collection of software tools that lets programmers write software that runs on GPUs, which were traditionally used primarily for rendering graphics in games. While there are open-source alternatives, as well as alternatives from Intel (with its ARC GPUs) and AMD (Nvidia’s main rival in the consumer space), these aren’t nearly as mature or feature-rich. Due to the complexities of AI models, one cannot just stand up a few of these things either — you need clusters of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of them for it to be worthwhile, making any investment in GPUs in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, especially considering they require completely different data center architecture to make them run. A common request — like asking a generative AI model to parse through thousands of lines of code and make a change or an addition — may use multiple of these $50,000 GPUs at the same time, and so if you aspire to serve thousands, or millions of concurrent users, you need to spend big. Really big. It’s these factors — the vendor lock-in, the ecosystem, and the fact that generative AI only works when you’re buying GPUs at scale — that underpin the rise of Nvidia. But beyond the economic and technical factors, there are human ones, too. To understand the AI bubble is to understand why CEOs do the things they do. Because an executive’s job is so vague, they can telegraph the value of their “labor” by spending money on initiatives and making partnerships. AI gave hyperscalers the excuse to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and buy a bunch of GPUs to go in them, because that, to the markets, looks like they’re doing something. By virtue of spending a lot of money in a frighteningly short amount of time, Satya Nadella received multiple glossy profiles, all without having to prove that AI can really do anything, be it a job or make Microsoft money. Nevertheless, AI allowed CEOs to look busy, and once the markets and journalists had agreed on the consensus opinion that “AI would be big,” all that these executives had to do was buy GPUs and “do AI.” We are in the midst of one of the darkest forms of software in history, described by many as an unwanted guest invading their products, their social media feeds, their bosses’ empty minds, and resting in the hands of monsters. Every story of its success feels bereft of any real triumph, with every literal description of its abilities involving multiple caveats about the mistakes it makes or the incredible costs of running it. Generative AI exists for two reasons: to cost money, and to make executives look busy. It was meant to be the new enterprise software and the new iPhone and the new Netflix all at once, a panacea where software guys pay one hardware guy for GPUs to unlock the incredible value creation of the future. Generative AI was always set up to fail, because it was meant to be everything, was talked about like it was everything, is still sold like it’s everything, yet for all the fucking hype, it all comes down to two companies: OpenAI, and, of course, NVIDIA. NVIDIA was, for a while, living high on the hog. All CEO Jensen Huang had to do every three months was saying “check out these numbers” and the markets and business journalists would squeal with glee, even as he said stuff like “the more you buy the more you save,” in part tipping his head to the (very real and sensible) idea of accelerated computing, but framed within the context of the cash inferno that’s generative AI, seems ludicrous. Huang’s showmanship worked really well for NVIDIA for a while, because for a while the growth was easy. Everybody was buying GPUs. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (and to a lesser extent Apple and Tesla) make up 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue, creating, at least for the first four, a degree of shared mania where everybody justified buying tens of billions of dollars of GPUs a year by saying “the other guy is doing it!” This is one of the major reasons the AI bubble is happening, because people conflated NVIDIA’s incredible sales with “interest in AI,” rather than everybody buying GPUs. Don’t worry, I’ll explain the revenue side a little bit later. We’re here for the long haul. Anyway, NVIDIA is facing a problem — that the only thing that grows forever is cancer. On September 9 2025, the Wall Street Journal said that NVIDIA’s “wow” factor was fading, going from beating analyst estimates in by nearly 21% in its Fiscal Year Q2 2024 earnings to scraping by with a mere 1.52% beat in its most-recent earnings — something that for any other company, would be a good thing, but framed against the delusional expectations that generative AI has inspired, is a figure that looks nothing short of ominous. Per the Wall Street Journal: In any other scenario, 56% year-over-year growth would lead to an abundance of Dom Perignon and Huang signing hundreds of boobs, but this is NVIDIA, and that’s just not good enough. Back in February 2024, NVIDIA was booking 265% year-over-year growth, but in its February 2025 earnings, NVIDIA only grew by a measly 78% year-over-year. It isn’t so much that NVIDIA isn’t growing, but that to grow year-over-year at the rates that people expect is insane. Life was a lot easier when NVIDIA went from $6.05 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2023 to $22 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2024, but for it to grow even 55% year-over-year from Q2 FY2026 ($46.7 billion) to Q2 2027 would require it to make $72.385 billion in revenue in the space of three months, mostly from selling GPUs (which make up around 88% of its revenue). This would put Nvidia in the ballpark of Microsoft ($76 billion in the last quarter) and within the neighborhood of Apple ($94 billion in the last quarter), predominantly making money in an industry that a year-and-a-half ago barely made the company $6 billion in a quarter. And the market needs NVIDIA to perform, as the company makes up 8% of the value of the S&P 500. It’s not enough for it to be wildly profitable, or have a monopsony on selling GPUs, or for it to have effectively 10x’d their stock in a few years. It must continue to grow at the fastest rate of anything ever, making more and more money selling these GPUs to a small group of companies that immediately start losing money once they plug them in. While a few members of the Magnificent Seven could be depended on to funnel tens of billions of dollars into a furnace each quarter, there were limits, even for companies like Microsoft, which had bought over 485,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. To take a step back, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make their money by either selling access to Large Language Models that people incorporate into their products, or by renting out servers full of GPUs to run inference (as said previously, the process to generate an output by a model or series of models) or train AI models for companies that develop and market models themselves, namely Anthropic and OpenAI. The latter revenue stream of which is where Jensen Huang found a solution to that eternal growth problem: the neocloud, namely CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius. These businesses are fairly straightforward. They own (or lease) data centers that they then fill full of servers that are full of NVIDIA GPUs, which they then rent on an hourly basis to customers, either on a per-GPU basis or in large batches for larger customers, who guarantee they'll use a certain amount of compute and sign up to long-term (i.e. more than an hour at a time) commitments. A neocloud is a specialist cloud compute company that exists only to provide access to GPUs for AI, unlike Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which have healthy businesses selling other kinds of compute, with AI (as I’ll get into later) failing to provide much of a return on investment. It’s not just the fact that these companies are more specialized than, say, Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft Azure. As you’ve gathered from the name, these are new, young, and in almost all cases, incredibly precarious businesses — each with financial circumstances that would make a Greek finance minister blush. That’s because setting up a neocloud is expensive. Even if the company in question already has data centers — as CoreWeave did with its cryptocurrency mining operation — AI requires completely new data center infrastructure to house and cool the GPUs, and those GPUs also need paying for, and then there’s the other stuff I mentioned earlier, like power, water, and the other bits of the computer (the CPU, the motherboard, the memory and storage, and the housing). As a result, these neoclouds are forced to raise billions of dollars in debt, which they collateralize using the GPUs they already have, along with contracts from customers, which they use to buy more GPUs. CoreWeave, for example, has $25 billion in debt on estimated revenues of $5.35 billion, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. You know who also invests in these neoclouds? NVIDIA! NVIDIA is also one of CoreWeave’s largest customers (accounting for 15% of its revenue in 2024), and just signed a deal to buy $6.3 billion of any capacity that CoreWeave can’t otherwise sell to someone else through 2032, an extension of a $1.3 billion 2023 deal reported by the Information. It was the anchor investor ($250 million) in CoreWeave’s IPO, too. NVIDIA is currently doing the same thing with Lambda, another neocloud that NVIDIA invested in, which also plans to go public next year. NVIDIA is also one of Lambda’s largest customers, signing a deal with it this summer to rent 10,000 GPUs for $1.3 billion over four years. In the UK, NVIDIA has just invested $700 million in Nscale, a former crypto miner that has never built an AI data center, and that has, despite having no experience, committed $1 billion (and/or 100,000 GPUs) to an OpenAI data center in Norway. On Thursday, September 25, Nscale announced it had closed another funding round, with NVIDIA listed as a main backer — although it’s unclear how much money it put in. It would be safe to assume it’s another few hundred million. NVIDIA also invested in Nebius, an outgrowth of Russian conglomerate Yandex, and Nebius provides, through a partnership with NVIDIA, tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of compute credits to companies in NVIDIA’s Inception startup program. NVIDIA’s plan is simple: fund these neoclouds, let these neoclouds load themselves up with debt, at which point they buy GPUs from NVIDIA, which can then be used as collateral for loans, along with contracts from customers, allowing the neoclouds to buy even more GPUs. It’s like that Robinhood infinite money glitch… …except, that is, for one small problem. There don’t appear to be that many customers. As I went into recently on my premium newsletter, NVIDIA funds and sustains Neoclouds as a way of funnelling revenue to itself, as well as partners like Supermicro and Dell, resellers that take NVIDIA GPUs and put them in servers to sell pre-built to customers. These two companies made up 39% of NVIDIA’s revenues last quarter. Yet when you remove hyperscaler revenue — Microsoft, Amazon, Google, OpenAI and NVIDIA — from the revenues of these neoclouds, there’s barely $1 billion in revenue combined, across CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda. CoreWeave’s $5.35 billion revenue is predominantly made up of its contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft (offering compute for OpenAI), Google (hiring CoreWeave to offer compute for OpenAI), and OpenAI itself, which has promised CoreWeave $22.4 billion in business over the next few years. This is all a lot of stuff, so I’ll make it really simple: there is no real money in offering AI compute, but that isn’t Jensen Huang’s problem, so he will simply force NVIDIA to hand money to these companies so that they have contracts to point to when they raise debt to buy more NVIDIA GPUs. Neoclouds are effectively giant private equity vehicles that exist to raise money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, or for hyperscalers to move money around so that they don’t increase their capital expenditures and can, as Microsoft did earlier in the year, simply walk away from deals they don’t like. Nebius’ “$17.4 billion deal” with Microsoft even included a clause in its 6-K filing that Microsoft can terminate the deal in the event the capacity isn’t built by the delivery dates, and Nebius has already used the contract to raise $3 billion to… build the data center to provide compute for the contract. Here, let me break down the numbers: From my analysis, it appears that CoreWeave, despite expectations to make that $5.35 billion this year, has only around $500 million of non-Magnificent Seven or OpenAI AI revenue in 2025, with Lambda estimated to have around $100 million in AI revenue, and Nebius around $250 million without Microsoft’s share, and that’s being generous. In simpler terms, the Magnificent Seven is the AI bubble, and the AI bubble exists to buy more GPUs, because (as I’ll show) there’s no real money or growth coming out of this, other than in the amount that private credit is investing — “$50 billion a quarter, for the low end, for the past three quarters.” I dunno man, let’s start simple: $50 billion a quarter of data center funding is going into an industry that has less revenue than Genshin Impact. That feels pretty bad. Who’s gonna use these data centers? How are they going to even make money on them? Private equity firms don’t typically hold onto assets, they sell them or take them public. Doesn’t seem great to me! Anyway, if AI was truly the next big growth vehicle, neoclouds would be swimming in diverse global revenue streams. Instead, they’re heavily-centralized around the same few names, one of which (NVIDIA) directly benefits from their existence not as a company doing business, but as an entity that can accrue debt and spend money on GPUs. These Neoclouds are entirely dependent on a continual flow of private credit from firms like Goldman Sachs (Nebius, CoreWeave, Lambda for its IPO), JPMorgan (Lambda, Crusoe, CoreWeave), and Blackstone (Lambda, CoreWeave), who have in a very real sense created an entire debt-based infrastructure to feed billions of dollars directly to NVIDIA, all in the name of an AI revolution that's yet to arrive. The fact that the rest of the neocloud revenue stream is effectively either a hyperscaler or OpenAI is also concerning. Hyperscalers are, at this point, the majority of data center capital expenditures, and have yet to prove any kind of success from building out this capacity, outside, of course, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which has succeeded in generating revenue while burning billions of dollars. Hyperscaler revenue is also capricious, but even if it isn’t, why are there no other major customers? Why, across all of these companies, does there not seem to be one major customer who isn’t OpenAI? The answer is obvious: nobody that wants it can afford it, and those who can afford it don’t need it. It’s also unclear what exactly hyperscalers are doing with this compute, because it sure isn’t “making money.” While Microsoft makes $10 billion in revenue from renting compute to OpenAI via Microsoft Azure, it does so at-cost, and was charging OpenAI $1.30-per-hour for each A100GPU it rents, a loss of $2.2 an hour per GPU, meaning that it is likely losing money on this compute, especially as SemiAnalysis has the total cost per hour per GPU at around $1.46 with the cost of capital and debt associated for a hyperscaler, though it’s unclear if that’s for an H100 or A100 GPU. In any case, how do these neoclouds pay for their debt if the hyperscalers give up, or NVIDIA doesn’t send them money, or, more likely, private credit begins to notice that there’s no real revenue growth outside of circular compute deals with neoclouds’ largest supplier, investor and customer? They don’t! In fact, I have serious concerns that they can’t even build the capacity necessary to fulfil these deals, but nobody seems to worry about that. No, really! It appears to be taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of compute capacity. How exactly are any of these neoclouds (or Oracle itself) able to expand to actually capture this revenue? Who knows! But I assume somebody is going to say “OpenAI!” Here’s an insane statistic for you: OpenAI will account for — in both its own revenue (projected $13 billion) and in its own compute costs ($16 billion, according to The Information, although that figure is likely out of date, and seemingly only includes the compute it’ll use, and not that it has committed to build, and thus has spent money on) — about 50% of all AI revenues in 2025. That figure takes into account the $400m ARR for ServiceNow, Adobe, and Salesforce; the $35bn in revenue for the Magnificent Seven from AI (not profit, and based on figures from the previous year); revenue from neoclouds like CoreWeave, Nebius, and Lambda; and the estimated revenue from the entire generative AI industry (including Anthropic and other smaller players, like Perplexity and Anysphere) for a total of $55bn.OpenAI is the generative AI industry — and it’s a dog of a company. As a reminder, OpenAI has leaked that it’ll burn $115 billion in the next four years, and based on my estimates, it needs to raise more than $290 billion in the next four years based on its $300 billion deal with Oracle alone. That alone is a very, very bad sign, especially as we’re three years and $500 billion or more into this hype cycle with few signs of life outside of, well, OpenAI promising people money. Credit to Anthony Restaino for this horrifying graphic: This is not what a healthy, stable industry looks like. Alright, well, things can’t be that bad on the software side. Right? Right? As I covered on my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, everybody is losing money on generative AI, in part because the cost of running AI models is increasing, and in part because the software itself doesn’t do enough to warrant the costs associated with running them, which are already subsidized and unprofitable for the model providers. Outside of OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Anthropic), nobody seems to be making much revenue, with the most “successful” company being Anysphere, makers of AI coding tool Cursor, which hit $500 million ‘annualized” (so $41.6 million in one month) a few months ago, just before Anthropic and OpenAI jacked up the prices for “priority processing” on enterprise queries, raising its operating costs as a result. In any case, that’s some piss-poor revenue for an industry that’s meant to be the future of software. Smartwatches are projected to make $32 billion this year, and as mentioned, the Magnificent Seven expects to make $35 billion or so in revenue from AI this year. Even Anthropic and OpenAI seem a little lethargic, both burning billions of dollars while making, by my estimates, no more than $2 billion and $6.26 billion in 2025 so far, despite projections of $5 billion and $13 billion respectively. Outside of these two, AI startups are floundering, struggling to stay alive and raising money in several-hundred million dollar bursts as their negative-gross-margin businesses flounder. As I dug into a few months ago, I could find only 12 AI-powered companies making more than $8.3 million a month, with two of them slightly improving their revenues, specifically AI search company Perplexity (which has now hit $150 million ARR, or $12.5 million in a month) and AI coding startup Replit (which also hit $150 million ARR in September). Both of these companies burn ridiculous amounts of money. Perplexity burned 164% of its revenue on Amazon Web Services, OpenAI and Anthropic last year, and while Replit hasn’t leaked its costs, The Information reports its gross margins in July were 23%, which doesn’t include the costs of its free users, which you simply have to do with LLMs as free users are capable of costing you a hell of a lot of money. Problematically, your paid users can also cost you more than they bring in as well. In fact, every user loses you money in generative AI, because it’s impossible to do cost control in a consistent manner. A few months ago, I did a piece about Anthropic losing money on every single Claude Code subscriber, and I’ll walk you through it in a very simplified fashion: Anthropic is, to be clear, the second-largest model developer, and has some of the best AI talent in the industry. It has a better handle on its infrastructure than anyone outside of big tech and OpenAI. It still cannot seem to fix this problem, even with weekly rate limits. While one could assume that Anthropic is simply letting people run wild, my theory is far simpler: even the model developers have no real way of limiting user activity, likely due to the architecture of generative AI. I know it sounds insane, but at the most advanced level, model providers are still prompting their models, and whatever rate limits may be in place appear to, at times, get completely ignored, and there doesn’t seem to be anything they can do to stop it. No, really. Anthropic counts amongst its capitalist apex predators one lone Chinese man who spent $50,000 of their compute in the space of a month fucking around with Claude Code. Even if Anthropic was profitable — it isn’t, and will burn billions this year — a customer paying $200-a-month running up $50,000 in costs immediately devours the margin of any user running the service that day, if not that week or month. Even if Anthropic’s costs are half the published rates, one guy amounted to 125 users’ monthly revenue. That’s not a real business! That’s a bad business with out-of-control costs, and it doesn’t appear anybody has these costs under control. A few weeks ago, Replit — an unprofitable AI coding company — released a product called “Agent 3.” which promised to be “10x more autonomous” and offer “infinitely more possibilities,” “[testing] and [fixing] its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop.” In reality, this means you’d go and tell the model to build something and it would “go do it,” and you’ll be shocked to hear that these models can’t be relied upon to “go and do” anything. Please note that this was launched a few months after Replit raised its prices, shifting to obfuscated “effort-based” pricing that would charge “the full scope of the agent’s work.” Agent 3 has been a disaster. Users found tasks that previously cost a few dollars were spiralling into the hundreds of dollars, with The Register reporting one customer found themselves with a $1000 bill after a week: Another user complained that “costs skyrocketed, without any concrete results”: As I previously reported, in late May/early June, both OpenAI and Anthropic cranked up the pricing on their enterprise customers, leading to Replit and Cursor both shifting their prices. This abuse has now trickled down to their customers. Replit has now released an update that lets you choose how autonomous you want Agent 3 to be, which is a tacit admission that you can’t trust coding LLMs to build software. Replit’s users are still pissed off, complaining that Replit is charging them for activity when the agent doesn’t do anything, a consistent problem across its Reddit. While Reddit is not the full summation of all users across every company, it’s a fairly good barometer of user sentiment, and man, are users pissy. Traditionally, Silicon Valley startups have relied upon the same model of “grow really fast and burn a bunch of money, then “turn the profit lever.” AI does not have a “profit lever,” because the raw costs of providing access to AI models are so high (and they’re only increasing) that the basic economics of how the tech industry sells software don’t make sense. I’ll reiterate something I wrote a few weeks ago: In simpler terms, it is very, very difficult to imagine what one user — free or otherwise — might cost, and thus it’s hard to charge them on a monthly basis, or tell them what a service might cost them on average. This is a huge problem with AI coding environments. According to The Information, Claude Code was driving “nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from a few weeks ago” on July 31 2025. That annualized revenue works out to about $33 million a month in revenue for a company that predicts it will make at least $416 million a month by the end of the year, and for a product that has become the most-popular coding environment in the world, from the second-largest and best-funded AI company in the world. …is that it? Is that all that’s happening here? $33 million dollars, all of it unprofitable, after it felt, at least based on social media chatter and discussing with multiple different software engineers, that Claude Code had become ubiquitous with anything to do with LLMs. To be clear, Anthropic’s Sonnet and Opus models are consistently some of the most popular for programming on Openrouter, an aggregator of LLM usage, and Anthropic has been consistently-named as “the best at coding.” Some bright spark out there is going to say that Microsoft’s Github Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and guess what, that’s true, and in fact, I reported it! Here’s another fun fact: the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft loses “on average more than $20-a-month-per-user,” with “...some users [costing] the company as much as $80.” And that’s for the most-popular product! If you believe the New York Times or other outlets that simply copy and paste whatever Dario Amodei says, you’d think that the reason that software engineers are having trouble finding work is because their jobs are being replaced by AI. This grotesque, abusive, manipulative and offensive lie has been propagated throughout the entire business and tech media without anybody sitting down and asking whether it’s true, or even getting a good understanding of what it is that LLMs can actually do with code. Members of the media, I am begging you, stop doing this. I get it, every asshole is willing to give a quote saying that “coding is dead,” and that every executive is willing to burp out some nonsense about replacing all of their engineers, but I am fucking begging you to either use these things yourself, or speak to people that do. I am not a coder. I cannot write or read code. Nevertheless, I am capable of learning, and have spoken to numerous software engineers in the last few months, and basically reached a consensus of “this is kind of useful, sometimes.” However, one very silly man once said that I don’t speak to people who use these tools, so I went and spoke to three notable, experienced software engineers, and asked them to give me the straight truth about what coding LLMs can do. In simple terms, LLMs are capable of writing code, but can’t do software engineering, because software engineering is the process of understanding, maintaining and executing code to produce functional software, and LLMs do not “learn,” cannot “adapt,” and (to paraphrase Brown), break down the more of your code and variables you ask them to look at at once. It’s very easy to believe that software engineering is just writing code, but the reality is that software engineers maintain software, which includes writing and analyzing code among a vast array of different personalities and programs and problems. Good software engineering harkens back to Brian Merchant’s interviews with translators — while some may believe that translators simply tell you what words mean, true translation is communicating the meaning of a sentence, which is cultural, contextual, regional, and personal, and often requires the exercise of creativity and novel thinking. My editor, Matthew Hughes, gave an example of this in his newsletter: Similarly, coding is not just “a series of text that programs a computer,” but a series of interconnected characters that refers to other software in other places that must also function now and explain, on some level, to someone who has never, ever seen the code before, why it was done this way. This is, by the way, why we are still yet to get any tangible proof that AI is replacing software engineers…because it can’t. Of all the fields supposedly at risk from “AI disruption,” coding feels (or felt) the most tangible, if only because the answer to “can you write code with LLMs” wasn’t an immediate, unilateral no. The media has also been quick to say that AI “writes software,” which is true in the same way that ChatGPT “writes novels”. In reality, LLMs can generate code, and do some software engineering-adjacent tasks, but, like all Large Language Models, break down and go totally insane, hallucinating more as the tasks get more complex. And, as I pointed out earlier, software engineering is not just coding. It involves thinking about problems, finding solutions to novel challenges, designing stuff in a way that can be read and maintained by others, and that’s (ideally) scalable and secure. The whole fucking point of an “AI” is that you hand shit off to it! That’s what they’ve been selling it as! That’s why Jensen Huang told kids to stop learning to code, as with AI, there’s no point. And it was all a lie. Generative AI can’t do the job of a software engineer, and it fails while also costing abominable amounts of money. Coding LLMs seem like magic at first, because they (to quote a conversation with Carl Brown) make the easy things easier, but they also make the harder things harder. They don’t even speed up engineers — they actually make them slower! Yet coding is basically the only obvious use case for LLMs. I’m sure you’re gonna say “but I bet the enterprise is doing well!” and you are so very, very wrong. Before I go any further, let’s establish some facts: All of this is to say that Microsoft has one of the largest commercial software empires in history, thousands (if not tens of thousands) of salespeople, and thousands of companies that literally sell Microsoft services for a living. And it can’t sell AI. A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers. This would amount to, if each of these users paid annually at the full rate of $30-a-month, to about $2.88 billion in annual revenue for a product category that makes $33 billion a fucking quarter. And I must be clear, I am 100% sure these users aren’t all paying $30 a month. The Information reported a few weeks ago that Microsoft has been “reducing the software’s price with more generous discounts on the AI features, according to customers and salespeople,” heavily suggesting discounts had already been happening. Enterprise software is traditionally sold at a discount anyway — or, put a different way, with bulk pricing for those who sign up a bunch of users at once. In fact, I’ve found evidence that it’s been doing this a while, with a 15% discount on annual Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions for orders of 10-to-300 seats mentioned by an IT consultant back in late 2024, and another that’s currently running through September 30, 2025 through Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider program, with up to 2400 licenses discounted if you pay upfront for the year. Microsoft seems to do this a lot, as I found another example of an offer that ran from January 1 2025 through March 31 2025. An “active” user is someone who has taken one action on Copilot in any Microsoft 365 app in the space of 28 days. Now, I know. That word, active. Maybe you’re thinking “Ed, this is like the gym model! There are unpaid licenses that Microsoft is getting paid for!” Fine! Let’s assume that Microsoft also has, based on research that suggests this is the case for all software companies, another 50% — four million — of paid Copilot licenses that aren’t being used. That still makes this 12 million users, which is still a putrid 2.72% conversion rate. So, why aren’t people paying for Copilot? Let’s hear from someone who talked to The Information: Microsoft 365 Copilot has been such a disaster that Microsoft will now integrate Anthropic’s models in an attempt and make them better. Oh, one other thing: sources also confirm GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%. I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August. So, The Information reported a few months ago that Microsoft’s projected AI revenues would be $13 billion, with $10 billion of that from OpenAI, leaving about $3 billion of total revenue across Microsoft 365 Copilot and any other foreseeable feature that Microsoft sells with “AI” on it. This heavily suggests that Microsoft is making somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on Azure or Microsoft 365 Copilot, though I suppose there are other places it could be making AI revenue too. Right? I guess. In any case, Microsoft’s net income (read: profit) in its last quarterly earnings was $27.2 billion. Pathetic. One of the comfortable lies that people tell themselves is that the AI bubble is similar to the fiber boom, or the dot com bubble, or Uber, or that we’re in the “growth stage,” or that “this is what software companies do, they spend a bunch of money then “pull the profit lever.” This is nothing like anything you’ve seen before, because this is the dumbest shit that the tech industry has ever done. AI data centers are nothing like fiber, because there are very few actual use cases for these GPUs outside of AI, and none of them are remotely hyperscale revenue drivers. As I discussed a month or so ago, data center development accounted for more of America’s GDP growth than all consumer spending combined, and there really isn’t any demand for AI in general, let alone at the scale that these hundreds of billions of dollars are being sunk into. The conservative estimate of capital expenditures related to data centers is around $400 billion, but given the $50 billion a quarter in private credit, I’m going to guess it breaks $500 billion, all to build capacity for an industry yet to prove itself. And this NVIDIA-OpenAI “$100 billion funding” news should only fill you full of dread, but also it isn’t fucking finalized, stop reporting it as if it’s done, I swear to god- Anyway, according to CNBC, “the initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized,” with “successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company’s then-current valuation as new capacity comes online.” At no point is anyone asking how, exactly, OpenAI builds data centers to fill full of these GPUs. In fact, I am genuinely shocked (and a little disgusted!) by how poorly this story has been told. Let’s go point by point: To be clear, when I say OpenAI needs at least $300 billion over the next four years, that’s if you believe its projections, which you shouldn’t. Let’s walk through its (alleged) numbers, while plagiarizing myself: According to The Information, here's the breakdown (these are projections): OpenAI's current reported burn is $116 billion through 2030, which means there is no way that these projections include $300 billion in compute costs, even when you factor in revenue. There is simply no space in these projections to absorb that $300 billion, and from what I can tell, by 2029, OpenAI will have actually burned more than $290 billion, assuming that it survives that long, which I do not believe it will. Don’t worry, though. OpenAI is about to make some crazy money. Here are the projections that CFO Sarah Friar signed off on: Just so we are clear, OpenAI intends to 10x its revenue in the space of four years, selling software and access to models in an industry with about $60 billion of revenue in 2025. How will it do this? It doesn’t say. I don’t know OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, but I do know that signing off on these numbers is, at the very least, ethically questionable. Putting aside the ridiculousness of OpenAI’s deals, or its funding requirements, Friar has willfully allowed Sam Altman and OpenAI to state goals that defy reality or good sense, all to take advantage of investors and public markets that have completely lost the plot. I need to be blunter: OpenAI has signed multiple different deals and contracts for amounts it cannot afford to pay, that it cannot hope to raise the money to pay for, that defy the amounts of venture capital and private credit available, all to sustain a company that will burn $300 billion and has no path to profitability of any kind. So, as I said above, CNBC reported on September 23, 2025 that the NVIDIA deal will be delivered in $10 billion tranches, the first of which is “expected to close within a month,” and the rest delivered “as new capacity comes online.” This is, apparently, all part of a plan to build 10GW of data center capacity with NVIDIA. A few key points: So, let’s start simple: data centers take forever to build. As I said previously, based on current reports, it’s taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of data center capacity, and nowhere in these reports does one reporter take a second to say “hey, what data centers are you talking about?” or “hey, didn’t Sam Altman say back in July that he was building 10GW of data center capacity with Oracle?” But wait, now Oracle and OpenAI have done another announcement that says they’re only doing 7GW, but they’re “ahead of schedule” on 10GW? Wait, is NVIDIA’s 10GW the same 10GW as Oracle and OpenAI are working on? Is it different? Nobody seems to know or care! Anyway, I cannot be clear enough how unlikely it is that (as NVIDIA has said) “the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026,” and that’s if it has bought the land and got the permits and ordered the construction, none of which has happened yet. But let’s get really specific on costs! Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI is a $15 billion joint venture, which means a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion. Abilene’s eight buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs. Though this math is a little funky due to NVIDIA promising to install its new Rubin GPUs in these theoretical data centers, that means these data centers will require a little under $200 billion worth of GPUs. By my maths that’s $325 billion. I’m so tired of this. A number of you have sent me the following image with some sort of comment about how “this is how it’ll work,” and you are wrong, because this is neither how it works nor how it will work nor accurate on any level. In the current relationship, NVIDIA Is Not Sending OpenAI $100 Billion, nor will it send it that much money, because 90% of OpenAI’s funding is gated behind building 9 or 10 gigawatts of data center capacity. In the current relationship, OpenAI does not have the money to pay Oracle. Also, can Oracle even afford to give that much money to NVIDIA? It had negative free cash flow last quarter, already has $104 billion in debt, and its biggest new customer cannot afford a single fucking thing it’s promised. The only company in this diagram that actually can afford to do any of this shit is NVIDIA, and even then it only has $56 billion cash on hand. In any case, as I went over on Friday, OpenAI has promised about a trillion dollars between compute contracts across Oracle, Microsoft, Google and CoreWeave, 17 Gigawatts of promised data centers in America between NVIDIA and “Stargate,” several more gigawatts of international data centers, custom chips from Broadcom, and their own company operations. How exactly does this get paid for? Nobody seems to ask these questions! Why am I the asshole doing this? Don’t we have tech analysts that are meant to analyse shit? AHhhhh- Every time I sit down to write about this subject the newsletters seem to get longer, because people are so painfully attached to the norms and tropes of the past. This post is, already, 17,500 words — a record for this newsletter — and I’ve still not finished editing and expanding it. What we’re witnessing is one of the most egregious wastes of capital in history, sold by career charlatans with their reputations laundered by a tech and business media afraid to criticize the powerful and analysts that don’t seem to want to tell their investors the truth. There are no historic comparisons here — even Britain’s abominable 1800s railway bubble, which absorbed half of the country’s national income, created valuable infrastructure for trains, a vehicle that can move people to and from places. GPUs are not trains, nor are they cars, or even CPUs. They are not adaptable to many other kinds of work, nor are they “the infrastructure of the future of tech,” because they’re already quite old and with everybody focused on buying them, you’d absolutely see one other use case by now that actually mattered. GPUs are expensive, power-hungry, environmentally destructive and require their own kinds of cooling and server infrastructure, making every GPU data center and environmental and fiscal bubble unto themselves. And, whereas the Victorian train infrastructure still exists in the UK — though it has been upgraded over the years — a GPU has a limited useful lifespan. These are cards that can — and will — break after a period of extended usage, whether that period is five years or later, and they’ll inevitably be superseded by something better and more powerful, meaning that the resale value of that GPU will only go down, with a price depreciation that’s akin to a new car. I am telling you, as I have been telling you for years, again and again and again, that the demand is not there for generative AI, and the demand is never, ever arriving. The only reason anyone humours any of this crap is the endless hoarding of GPUs to build capacity for a revolution that will never arrive. Well, that and OpenAI, a company built and sold on lies about ChatGPT’s capabilities. ChatGPT’s popularity — and OpenAI’s hunger for endless amounts of compute — have created the illusion of demand due to the sheer amount of capacity required to keep their services operational, all so they can burn $8 billion or more in 2025 and, if my estimates are right, nearly a trillion dollars by 2030. This NVIDIA deal is a farce — an obvious attempt by the largest company on the American stock market to prop up the one significant revenue-generator in the entire industry, knowing that time is running out for it to create new avenues for eternal growth. I’d argue that NVIDIA’s deal also shows the complete contempt that these companies have for the media. There are no details about how this deal works beyond the initial $10 billion, there’s no land purchased, no data center construction started, and yet the media slurps it down without a second thought. I am but one man, and I am fucking peculiar. I did not learn financial analysis in school, but I appear to be one of the few people doing even the most basic analysis of these deals, and while I’m having a great time doing so, I am also exceedingly frustrated at how little effort is being put into prying apart these deals. I realize how ridiculous all of this sounds. I get it. There’s so much money being promised to so many people, market rallies built off the back of massive deals, and I get that the assumption is that this much money can’t be wrong, that this many people wouldn’t just say stuff without intending to follow through, or without considering whether their company could afford it. I know it’s hard to conceive that hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested in something for no apparent reason, but it’s happening, right god damn now, in front of your eyes, and I am going to be merciless on anyone who attempts to write a “how could we see this coming?” Generative AI has never been reliable, has always been unprofitable, and has always been unsustainable, and I’ve been saying so since February 2024. The economics have never made sense, something I’ve said repeatedly since April 2024, and when I wrote “How Does OpenAI Survive?” in July 2024, I had multiple people suggest I was being alarmist. Here’s some alarmism for you: the longer it takes for OpenAI to die, the more damage it will cause to the tech industry. On Friday, when I put out my piece on OpenAI needing a trillion dollars, I asked analyst Gil Luria if the capital was there to build the 17 Gigawatts that OpenAI had allegedly planned to build. He said the following: That doesn’t sound good! Anyway, as I discussed earlier, venture capital could run out in six quarters, with investor and researcher Jon Sakoda estimating that there will only be around $164 billion of dry powder (available capital) in US VC firms by the end of 2025. In July, The French Tech Journal reported (using Pitchbook data) that global venture capital deal activity reached its lowest first-half total since 2018, with $139.4 billion in deal value in the first half of 2025, down from $183.4 billion in the first half of 2024, meaning that any further expansion or demands for venture capital from OpenAI will likely sap the dwindling funds available from other startups. Things get worse when you narrow things to US venture capital. In a piece from April, EY reported that VC-backed investment in US companies hit $80 billion in Q1 2025, but “one $40 billion deal” accounted for half of the investment — OpenAI’s $40 billion deal of which only $10 billion has actually closed, and that didn’t happen until fucking June. Without the imaginary money from OpenAI, US venture would have declined by 36%. The longer that OpenAI survives, the longer it will sap the remaining billions from the tech ecosystem, and I expect it to extend its tendrils to private credit too. The $325 billion it needs just to fulfil its NVIDIA contract, albeit over 4 years, is an egregious sum that I believe exceeds the available private capital in the world. Let’s get specific, and check out the top 10 private equity firms’ available capital! Assuming that all of this capital is currently available, the top 10 private equity firms in the world have around $477 billion of available capital. We can, of course, include investment banks — Goldman Sachs had around $520 billion cash in hand available at the end of its last quarter, and JPMorgan over $1.7 trillion, but JP Morgan has only dedicated $50 billion in direct lending commitments as of February 2025, and while Goldman Sachs expanded its direct private credit lending by $15 billion back in June, that appears to be an extension of its “more than $20 billion” direct lending close from mid-2024. Include both of those, and that brings us up to — if we assume that all of these funds are available — $562 billion in capital and about $164 billion in US venture available to spend, and that’s meant to go to more places than just OpenAI. Sure, sure, there’s more than just the top 10 private equity firms and there’s venture money outside of the US, but what could it be? Like, another $150 billion? You see, OpenAI needs to buy those GPUs, and it needs to build those data centers, and it needs to pay its thousands of staff and marketing and sales costs too. While OpenAI likely wouldn’t be the ones raising the money for the data centers — and honestly, I’m not sure who would do it at this point? — somebody is going to need to build TWENTY GIGAWATTS OF DATA CENTERS if we’re to believe both Oracle and NVIDIA You may argue that venture funds and private credit can raise more, and you’re right! But at this point, there have been few meaningful acquisitions of AI companies, and zero exits from the billions of dollars put into data centers. Even OpenAI admits in its own announcement about new Stargate sites that this will be a “$400 billion investment over 3 years.” Where the fuck is that money coming from? Is OpenAI really going to absorb massive chunks of all available private credit and venture capital for the next few years? And no, god, stop saying the US government will bail this out. It will have to bail out hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no scenario where it’s anything less than that, and I’ve already been over this. While the US government has spent equivalent sums in the past to support private business (the total $440 billion dispersed during the Great Recession’s TARP program, where the Treasury bought toxic assets from investment banks to stop them from imploding a la Lehman, springs to mind), it’s hard to imagine any case where OpenAI is seen as vital to the global financial system — and the economic health of the US — as the banking system. Sure, we spent around $1tn — if we’re being specific, $953bn — on the Paycheck Protection Program during the Covid era, but that was to keep people employed at a time when the economy outside of Zoom and Walmart had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist. There was an urgency that doesn’t apply here. If OpenAI goes tits up, Softbank loses some money — nothing new there — and Satya Nadella has to explain why he spent tens of billions of dollars on a bunch of data centers filled with $50,000 GPUs that are, at this point, ornamental. And while there will be — and have been — disastrous economic consequences, they won’t be as systemically catastrophic as that of the pandemic, or the global financial crisis. To be clear, it’ll be bad, but not as bad. And there’s also the problem of moral hazard — if the government steps in, what’s to stop big tech chasing its next fruitless rainbow? — and optics. If people resented bailing out the banks after they acted like profligate gamblers and lost, how will they feel bailing out fucking Sam Altman and Jensen Huang? I do apologize for the length of this piece, but the significance of this bubble requires depth. There is little demand, little real money, and little reason to continue, and the sheer lack of responsibility and willingness to kneel before the powerful fills me full of angry bile. I understand many journalists are not in a position where they can just write “this shit sounds stupid,” but we have entered a deeply stupid era, and by continuing to perpetuate the myth of AI, the media guarantees that retail investors and regular people’s 401Ks will suffer. It is now inevitable that this bubble bursts. Deutsche Bank has said the AI boom is unsustainable outside of tech spending “remaining parabolic,” which it says “is highly unlikely,” and Bain Capital has said that $2 trillion in new revenue is needed to fund AI’s scaling, and even that math is completely fucked as it talks about “AI-related savings”: Even when stared in the face by a ridiculous idea — $2 trillion of new revenue in a global software market that’s expected to be around $817 billion in 2025 — Bain still oinks out some nonsense about the “savings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support and R&D,” yet another myth perpetuated I assume to placate the fucking morons sinking billions into this. Every single “vibe coding is the future,” “the power of AI,” and “AI job loss” story written perpetuates a myth that will only lead to more regular people getting hurt when the bubble bursts. Every article written about OpenAI or NVIDIA or Oracle that doesn’t explicitly state that the money doesn’t exist, that the revenues are impossible, that one of the companies involved burns billions of dollars and has no path to profitability, is an act of irresponsible make believe and mythos. I am nobody. I am not a financier. I am not anybody special. I just write a lot, and read a lot, and can do the most basic maths in the world. I am not trying to be anything other than myself, nor do I have an agenda, other than the fact that I like doing this and I hate how this story is being told. I never planned for this newsletter to get this big, and now that it has, I’m going to keep doing the same thing every week. I also believe that the way to stop this happening again is to have a thorough and well-sourced explanation of everything as it happens, ripping down the narratives as they’re spun and making it clear who benefits from them and how and why they’re choosing to do so. When things collapse, we need to be clear about how many times people chose to look the other way, or to find good faith ways to interpret bad faith announcements and leak.

Soundtrack: Queens of the Stone Age - First It Giveth Before we go any further: This is, for the third time this year, the longest newsletter I've ever written, weighing in somewhere around 18,500 words. I've written it specifically to be read at your leisure — dip in and out where you'd like — but also in one go. This is my comprehensive case that yes, we’re in a bubble, one that will inevitably (and violently) collapse in the near future. I'll also be cutting this into a four-part episode starting tomorrow on my podcast Better Offline. I deeply appreciate your time. If you like this newsletter, please think about subscribing to the premium, which I write weekly. Thanks for reading. Alright, let’s do this one last time. In 2022, a (kind-of) company called OpenAI surprised the world with a website called ChatGPT that could generate text that sort-of sounded like a person using a technology called Large Language Models (LLMs), which can also be used to generate images, video and computer code. Large Language Models require entire clusters of servers connected with high-speed networking, all containing this thing called a GPU — graphics processing units. These are different to the GPUs in your Xbox, or laptop, or gaming PC. They cost much, much more, and they’re good at doing the processes of inference (the creation of the output of any LLM) and training (feeding masses of training data to models, or feeding them information about what a good output might look like, so they can later identify a thing or replicate it). These models showed some immediate promise in their ability to articulate concepts or generate video, visuals, audio, text and code. They also immediately had one glaring, obvious problem: because they’re probabilistic, these models can’t actually be relied upon to do the same thing every single time. So, if you generated a picture of a person that you wanted to, for example, use in a story book, every time you created a new page, using the same prompt to describe the protagonist, that person would look different — and that difference could be minor (something that a reader should shrug off), or it could make that character look like a completely different person. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of generative AI meant that whenever you asked it a question, it would guess as to the answer, not because it knew the answer, but rather because it was guessing on the right word to add in a sentence based on previous training data. As a result, these models would frequently make mistakes — something which we later referred to as “hallucinations.” And that’s not even mentioning the cost of training these models, the cost of running them, the vast amounts of computational power they required, the fact that the legality of using material scraped from books and the web without the owner’s permission was (and remains) legally dubious, or the fact that nobody seemed to know how to use these models to actually create profitable businesses. These problems were overshadowed by something flashy, and new, and something that investors — and the tech media — believed would eventually automate the single thing that’s proven most resistant to automation: namely, knowledge work and the creative economy. This newness and hype and these expectations sent the market into a frenzy, with every hyperscaler immediately creating the most aggressive market for one supplier I’ve ever seen. NVIDIA has sold over $200 billion of GPUs since the beginning of 2023, becoming the largest company on the stock market and trading at over $170 as of writing this sentence only a few years after being worth $19.52 a share. While I’ve talked about some of the propelling factors behind the AI wave — automation and novelty — that’s not a complete picture. A huge reason why everybody decided to “do AI” was because the software industry’s growth was slowing, with SaaS (Software As A Service) company valuations stalling or dropping, resulting in the terrifying prospect of companies having to “under promise and over deliver” and “be efficient.” Things that normal companies — those whose valuations aren’t contingent on ever-increasing, ever-constant growth — don’t have to worry about, because they’re normal companies. Suddenly, there was the promise of a new technology — Large Language Models — that were getting exponentially more powerful, which was mostly a lie but hard to disprove because “powerful” can mean basically anything, and the definition of “powerful” depended entirely on whoever you asked at any given time, and what that person’s motivations were. The media also immediately started tripping on its own feet, mistakenly claiming OpenAI’s GPT-4 model tricked a Taskrabbit into solving a CAPTCHA (it didn’t — this never happened), or saying that “people who don’t know how to code already [used] bots to produce full-fledged games,” and if you’re wondering what “full-fledged” means, it means “pong” and a cobbled-together rolling demo of SkyRoads, a game from 1993. The media (and investors) helped peddle the narrative that AI was always getting better, could do basically anything, and that any problems you saw today would be inevitably solved in a few short months, or years, or, well, at some point I guess. LLMs were touted as a digital panacea, and the companies building them offered traditional software companies the chance to plug these models into their software using an API, thus allowing them to ride the same generative AI wave that every other company was riding. The model companies similarly started going after individual and business customers, offering software and subscriptions that promised the world, though this mostly boiled down to chatbots that could generate stuff, and then doubled down with the promise of “agents” — a marketing term that’s meant to make you think “autonomous digital worker” but really means “broken digital product.” Throughout this era, investors and the media spoke with a sense of inevitability that they never really backed up with data. It was an era based on confidently-asserted “vibes.” Everything was always getting better and more powerful, even though there was never much proof that this was truly disruptive technology, other than in its ability to disrupt apps you were using with AI — making them worse by, for example, suggesting questions on every Facebook post that you could ask Meta AI, but which Meta AI couldn’t answer. “AI” was omnipresent, and it eventually grew to mean everything and nothing. OpenAI would see its every move lorded over like a gifted child, its CEO Sam Altman called the “Oppenheimer of Our Age,” even if it wasn’t really obvious why everyone was impressed. GPT-4 felt like something a bit different, but was it actually meaningful? The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is built and sold on not just faith, but a series of myths that the AI boosters expect us to believe with the same certainty that we treat things like gravity, or the boiling point of water. Can large language models actually replace coders? Not really, no, and I’ll get into why later in the piece. Can Sora — OpenAI’s video creation tool — replace actors or animators? No, not at all, but it still fills the air full of tension because you can immediately see who is pre-registered to replace everyone that works for them. AI is apparently replacing workers, but nobody appears to be able to prove it! But every few weeks a story runs where everybody tries to pretend that AI is replacing workers with some poorly-sourced and incomprehensible study, never actually saying “someone’s job got replaced by AI” because it isn’t happening at scale, and because if you provide real-world examples, people can actually check. To be clear, some people have lost jobs to AI, just not the white collar workers, software engineers, or really any of the career paths that the mainstream media and AI investors would have you believe. Brian Merchant has done excellent work covering how LLMs have devoured the work of translators, using cheap, “almost good” automation to lower already-stagnant wages in a field that was already hurting before the advent of generative AI, with some having to abandon the field, and others pushed into bankruptcy. I’ve heard the same for art directors, SEO experts, and copy editors, and Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal covered these last year. These are all fields with something in common: shitty bosses with little regard for their customers who have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to slash contract labor. To quote Merchant, “the drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of ‘powerful AI’ encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have.” Across the board, the people being “replaced” by AI are the victims of lazy, incompetent cost-cutters who don’t care if they ship poorly-translated text. To quote Merchant again, “[AI hype] has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting “good enough” automation output for video games and media products.” Yet the jobs crisis facing translators speaks to the larger flaws of the Large Language Model era, and why other careers aren’t seeing this kind of disruption. Generative AI creates outputs, and by extension defines all labor as some kind of output created from a request. In the case of translation, it’s possible for a company to get by with a shitty version, because many customers see translation as “what do these words say,” even though (as one worker told Merchant) translation is about conveying meaning. Nevertheless, “translation” work had already started to condense to a world where humans would at times clean up machine-generated text, and the same worker warned that the same might come for other industries. Yet the problem is that translation is a heavily output-driven industry, one where (idiot) bosses can say “oh yeah that’s fine” because they ran an output back through Google Translate and it seemed fine in their native tongue. The problems of a poor translation are obvious, but the customers of translation are, it seems, often capable of getting by with a shitty product. The problem is that most jobs are not output-driven at all, and what we’re buying from a human being is a person’s ability to think. Every CEO talking about AI replacing workers is an example of the real problem: that most companies are run by people who don’t understand or experience the problems they’re solving, don’t do any real work, don’t face any real problems, and thus can never be trusted to solve them. The Era of the Business Idiot is the result of letting management consultants and neoliberal “free market” sociopaths take over everything, leaving us with companies run by people who don’t know how the companies make money, just that they must always make more. When you’re a big, stupid asshole, every job that you see is condensed to its outputs, and not the stuff that leads up to the output, or the small nuances and conscious decisions that make an output good as opposed to simply acceptable, or even bad. What does a software engineer do? They write code! What does a writer do? They write words! What does a hairdresser do? They cut hair! Yet that’s not actually the case. As I’ll get into later, a software engineer does far more than just code, and when they write code they’re not just saying “what would solve this problem?” with a big smile on their face — they’re taking into account their years of experience, what code does, what code could do, all the things that might break as a result, and all of the things that you can’t really tell from just looking at code, like whether there’s a reason things are made in a particular way. A good coder doesn’t just hammer at the keyboard with the aim of doing a particular task. They factor in questions like: How does this functionality fit into the code that’s already here? Or, if someone has to update this code in the future, how do I make it easy for them to understand what I’ve written and to make changes without breaking a bunch of other stuff? A writer doesn’t just “write words.” They jostle ideas and ideals and emotions and thoughts and facts and feelings into a condensed piece of text, explaining both what’s happening and why it’s happening from their perspective, finding nuanced ways to convey large topics, none of which is the result of a single (or many) prompts but the ever-shifting sand of a writer’s brain. Good writing is a fight between a bunch of different factors: structure, style, intent, audience, and prioritizing the things that you (or your client) care about in the text. It’s often emotive — or at the very least, driven or inspired by a given emotion — which is something that an AI simply can’t replicate in a way that’s authentic and believable. And a hairdresser doesn’t just cut hair, but cuts your hair, which may be wiry, dry, oily, long, short, healthy, unhealthy, on a scalp with particular issues, at a time of year when perhaps you want to change length, at a time that fits you, in “the way you like” which may be impossible to actually write down but they get it just right. And they make conversation, making you feel at ease while they snip and clip away at your tresses, with you having to trust that they’ll get it right. This is the true nature of labor that executives fail to comprehend at scale: that the things we do are not units of work, but extrapolations of experience, emotion, and context that cannot be condensed in written meaning. Business Idiots see our labor as the result of a smart manager saying “do this,” rather than human ingenuity interpreting both a request and the shit the manager didn’t say. What does a CEO do? Uhhh, um, well, a Harvard study says they spend 25% of their time on “people and relationships,” 25% on “functional and business unit reviews,” 16% on “organization and culture,” and 21% on “strategy,” with a few percent here and there for things like “professional development.” That’s who runs the vast majority of companies: people that describe their work predominantly as “looking at stuff,” “talking to people” and “thinking about what we do next.” The most highly-paid jobs in the world are impossible to describe, their labor described in a mish-mash of LinkedInspiraton, yet everybody else’s labor is an output that can be automated. As a result, Large Language Models seem like magic. When you see everything as an outcome — an outcome you may or may not understand, and definitely don’t understand the process behind, let alone care about — you kind of already see your workers as LLMs. You create a stratification of the workforce that goes beyond the normal organizational chart, with senior executives — those closer to the class level of CEO — acting as those who have risen above the doldrums of doing things to the level of “decisionmaking,” a fuzzy term that can mean everything from “making nuanced decisions with input from multiple different subject-matter experts” to, as ServiceNow Bill McDermott did in 2022, “[make] it clear to everybody [in a boardroom of other executives], everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.” The same extends to some members of the business and tech media that have, for the most part, gotten by without having to think too hard about the actual things the companies are saying. I realize this sounds a little mean, and I must be clear it doesn’t mean that these people know nothing, just that it’s been possible to scoot through the world without thinking too hard about whether or not something is true. When Salesforce said back in 2024 that its “Einstein Trust Layer” and AI would be “transformational for jobs,” the media dutifully wrote it down and published it without a second thought. It fully trusted Marc Benioff when he said that Agentforce agents would replace human workers, and then again when he said that AI agents are doing “30% to 50% of all the work in Salesforce itself,” even though that’s an unproven and nakedly ridiculous statement. Salesforce’s CFO said earlier this year that AI wouldn’t boost sales growth in 2025. One would think this would change how they’re covered, or how seriously one takes Marc Benioff. It hasn’t, because nobody is paying attention. In fact, nobody seems to be doing their job. This is how the core myths of generative AI were built: by executives saying stuff and the media publishing it without thinking too hard. AI is replacing workers! AI is writing entire computer programs! AI is getting exponentially more-powerful! What does “powerful” mean? That the models are getting better on benchmarks that are rigged in their favor, but because nobody fucking explains it, regular people are regularly told that AI is “powerful.” The only thing “powerful” about generative AI is its mythology. The world’s executives, entirely disconnected from labor and actual production, are doing the only thing they know how to — spend a bunch of money and say vague stuff about “AI being the future.” There are people — journalists, investors, and analysts — that have built entire careers on filling in the gaps for the powerful as they splurge billions of dollars and repeat with increasing desperation that “the future is here” as absolutely nothing happens. You’ve likely seen a few ridiculous headlines recently. One of the most recent, and most absurd, is that that OpenAI will pay Oracle $300 billion over four years, closely followed with the claim that NVIDIA will “invest” “$100 billion” in OpenAI to build 10GW of AI data centers, though the deal is structured in a way that means that OpenAI is paid “progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” and OpenAI will be leasing the chips (rather than buying them outright). I must be clear that these deals are intentionally made to continue the myth of generative AI, to pump NVIDIA, and to make sure OpenAI insiders can sell $10.3 billion of shares. OpenAI cannot afford the $300 billion, NVIDIA hasn’t sent OpenAI a cent and won’t do so if it can’t build the data centers, which OpenAI most assuredly can’t afford to do. NVIDIA needs this myth to continue, because in truth, all of these data centers are being built for demand that doesn’t exist, or that — if it exists — doesn’t necessarily translate into business customers paying huge amounts for access to OpenAI’s generative AI services. NVIDIA, OpenAI, CoreWeave and other AI-related companies hope that by announcing theoretical billions of dollars (or hundreds of billions of dollars) of these strange, vague and impossible-seeming deals, they can keep pretending that demand is there, because why else would they build all of these data centers, right? That, and the entire stock market rests on NVIDIA’s back. It accounts for 7% to 8% of the value of the S&P 500, and Jensen Huang needs to keep selling GPUs. I intend to explain later on how all of this works, and how brittle it really is. The intention of these deals is simple: to make you think “this much money can’t be wrong.” It can. These people need you to believe this is inevitable, but they are being proven wrong, again and again, and today I’m going to continue doing so. Underpinning these stories about huge amounts of money and endless opportunity lies a dark secret — that none of this is working, and all of this money has been invested in a technology that doesn’t make much revenue and loves to burn millions or billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. Over half a trillion dollars has gone into an entire industry without a single profitable company developing models or products built on top of models. By my estimates, there is around $44 billion of revenue in generative AI this year (when you add in Anthropic and OpenAI’s revenues to the pot, along with the other stragglers) and most of that number has been gathered through reporting from outlets like The Information, because none of these companies share their revenues, all of them lose shit tons of money, and their actual revenues are really, really small. Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue — Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported “$13 billion in annualized revenue,” so around $1.083 billion a month. Microsoft is a sales MACHINE. It is built specifically to create or exploit software markets, suffocating competitors by using its scale to drive down prices, and to leverage the ecosystem that it’s created over the past few decades. $1 billion a month in revenue is chump change for an organization that makes over $27 billion a quarter in PROFITS. Don’t worry Satya, I’ll come back to you later. “But Ed, the early days!” Worry not — I’ve got that covered. This is nothing like any other era of tech. There has never been this kind of cash-rush, even in the fiber boom. Over a decade, Amazon spent about one-tenth of the capex that the Magnificent Seven spent in two years on generative AI building AWS — something that now powers a vast chunk of the web, and has long been Amazon’s most profitable business unit. Generative AI is nothing like Uber, with OpenAI and Anthropic’s true costs coming in at about $159 billion in the past two years, approaching five times Uber’s $30 billion all-time burn. And that’s before the bullshit with NVIDIA and Oracle. Microsoft last reported AI revenue in January. It’s October this week. Why did it stop reporting this number, you think? Is it because the numbers are so good it couldn’t possibly let people know? As a general rule, publicly traded companies — especially those where the leadership are compensated primarily in equity — tend to brag about their successes, in part because said bragging boosts the value of the thing that the leadership gets paid in. There’s no benefit to being shy. Oracle literally made a regulatory filing to boast it had a $30 billion customer, which turned out to be OpenAI, who eventually agreed (publicly) to spend $300 billion in compute over five years. Which is to say that Microsoft clearly doesn’t have any good news to share, and as I’ll reveal later, they can’t even get 3% of their 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot. If Microsoft can’t sell this shit, nobody can. Anyway, I’m nearly done, sorry, you see, I’m writing this whole thing as if you’re brand new and walking up to this relatively unprepared, so I need to introduce another company. In 2020, a splinter group jumped off of OpenAI, funded by Amazon and Google to do much the same thing as OpenAI but pretend to be nicer about it until they have to raise from the Middle East. Anthropic has always been better at coding for some reason, and people really like its Claude models. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have become the only two companies in generative AI to make any real progress, either in terms of recognition or in sheer commercial terms, accounting for the majority of the revenue in the AI industry. In a very real sense, the AI industry’s revenue is OpenAI and Anthropic. In the year where Microsoft recorded $13bn in AI revenues, $10 billion came from OpenAI’s spending on Microsoft Azure. Anthropic burned $5.3 billion last year — with the vast majority of that going towards compute. Outside of these two companies, there’s barely enough revenue to justify a single data center. Where we sit today is a time of immense tension. Mark Zuckerberg says we’re in a bubble, Sam Altman says we’re in a bubble, Alibaba Chairman and billionaire Joe Tsai says we’re in a bubble, Apollo says we’re in a bubble, nobody is making money and nobody knows why they’re actually doing this anymore, just that they must do it immediately. And they have yet to make the case that generative AI warranted any of these expenditures. That was undoubtedly the longest introduction to a newsletter I’ve ever written, and the reason why I took my time was because this post demands a level of foreshadowing and exposition, and because I want to make it make sense to anyone who reads it — whether they’ve read my newsletter for years, or whether they’re only just now investigating their suspicions that generative AI may not be all it’s cracked up to be. Today I will make the case that generative AI’s fundamental growth story is flawed, and explain why we’re in the midst of an egregious bubble. This industry is sold by keeping things vague, and knowing that most people don’t dig much deeper than a headline, a problem I simply do not have. This industry is effectively in service of two companies — OpenAI and NVIDIA — who pump headlines out through endless contracts between them and subsidiaries or investments to give the illusion of activity. OpenAI is now, at this point, on the hook for over a trillion dollars, an egregious sum for a company that already forecast billions in losses, with no clear explanation as to how it’ll afford any of this beyond “we need more money” and the vague hope that there’s another Softbank or Microsoft waiting in the wings to swoop in and save the day. I’m going to walk you through where I see this industry today, and why I see no future for it beyond a fiery apocalypse. While everybody (reasonably!) harps on about hallucinations — which, to remind you, is when a model authoritatively states something that isn’t true — but the truth is far more complex, and far worse than it seems. You cannot rely on a large language model to do what you want. Even the most highly-tuned models on the most expensive and intricate platform can’t actually be relied upon to do exactly what you want. A “hallucination” isn’t just when these models say something that isn’t true. It’s when they decide to do something wrong because it seems the most likely thing to do, or when a coding model decides to go on a wild goose chase, failing the user and burning a ton of money in the process. The advent of “reasoning” models — those engineered to ‘think’ through problems in a way reminiscent of a human — and the expansion of what people are (trying) to use LLMs for demands that the definition of an AI hallucination be widened, not merely referring to factual errors, but fundamental errors in understanding the user’s request or intent, or what constitutes a task, in part because these models cannot think and do not know anything. However successful a model might be in generating something good *once*, it will also often generate something bad, or it’ll generate the right thing but in an inefficient and over-verbose fashion. You do not know what you’re going to get each time, and hallucinations multiply with the complexity of the thing you’re asking for, or whether a task contains multiple steps (which is a fatal blow to the idea of “agents.” You can add as many levels of intrigue and “reasoning” as you want, but Large Language Models cannot be trusted to do something correctly, or even consistently, every time. Model companies have successfully convinced everybody that the issue is that users are prompting the models wrong, and that people need to be “trained to use AI,” but what they’re doing is training people to explain away the inconsistencies of Large Language Models, and to assume individual responsibility for what is an innate flaw in how large language models work. Large Language Models are also uniquely expensive. Many mistakenly try and claim this is like the dot com boom or Uber, but the basic unit economics of generative AI are insane. Providers must purchase tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs each costing $50,000 a piece, and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of infrastructure for large clusters. And that’s without mentioning things like staffing, construction, power, or water. Then you turn them on and start losing money. Despite hundreds of billions of GPUs sold, nobody seems to make any money, other than NVIDIA, the company that makes them, and resellers like Dell and Supermicro who buy the GPUs, put them in servers, and sell them to other people. This arrangement works out great for Jensen Huang, and terribly for everybody else. I am going to explain the insanity of the situation we find ourselves in, and why I continue to do this work undeterred. The bubble has entered its most pornographic, aggressive and destructive stage, where the more obvious it becomes that they’re cooked, the more ridiculous the generative AI industry will act — a dark juxtaposition against every new study that says “generative AI does not work” or new story about ChatGPT’s uncanny ability to activate mental illness in people. So, let’s start simple: NVIDIA is a hardware company that sells GPUs, including the consumer GPUs that you’d see in a modern gaming PC, but when you read someone say “GPU” within the context of AI, they mean enterprise-focused GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and more modern GPUs like the Blackwell-series B200 and GB200 (which combines two GPUs with an NVIDIA CPU). These GPUs cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 (or as high as $70,000 for the newer Blackwell GPUs), and require tens of thousands of dollars more of infrastructure — networking to “cluster” server racks of GPUs together to provide compute, and massive cooling systems to deal with the massive amounts of heat they produce, as well as the servers themselves that they run on, which typically use top-of-the-line data center CPUs, and contain vast quantities of high-speed memory and storage. While the GPU itself is likely the most expensive single item within an AI server, the other costs — and I’m not even factoring in the actual physical building that the server lives in, or the water or electricity that it uses — add up. I’ve mentioned NVIDIA because it has a virtual monopoly in this space. Generative AI effectively requires NVIDIA GPUs, in part because it’s the only company really making the kinds of high-powered cards that generative AI demands, and because NVIDIA created something called CUDA — a collection of software tools that lets programmers write software that runs on GPUs, which were traditionally used primarily for rendering graphics in games. While there are open-source alternatives, as well as alternatives from Intel (with its ARC GPUs) and AMD (Nvidia’s main rival in the consumer space), these aren’t nearly as mature or feature-rich. Due to the complexities of AI models, one cannot just stand up a few of these things either — you need clusters of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of them for it to be worthwhile, making any investment in GPUs in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, especially considering they require completely different data center architecture to make them run. A common request — like asking a generative AI model to parse through thousands of lines of code and make a change or an addition — may use multiple of these $50,000 GPUs at the same time, and so if you aspire to serve thousands, or millions of concurrent users, you need to spend big. Really big. It’s these factors — the vendor lock-in, the ecosystem, and the fact that generative AI only works when you’re buying GPUs at scale — that underpin the rise of Nvidia. But beyond the economic and technical factors, there are human ones, too. To understand the AI bubble is to understand why CEOs do the things they do. Because an executive’s job is so vague, they can telegraph the value of their “labor” by spending money on initiatives and making partnerships. AI gave hyperscalers the excuse to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and buy a bunch of GPUs to go in them, because that, to the markets, looks like they’re doing something. By virtue of spending a lot of money in a frighteningly short amount of time, Satya Nadella received multiple glossy profiles, all without having to prove that AI can really do anything, be it a job or make Microsoft money. Nevertheless, AI allowed CEOs to look busy, and once the markets and journalists had agreed on the consensus opinion that “AI would be big,” all that these executives had to do was buy GPUs and “do AI.” We are in the midst of one of the darkest forms of software in history, described by many as an unwanted guest invading their products, their social media feeds, their bosses’ empty minds, and resting in the hands of monsters. Every story of its success feels bereft of any real triumph, with every literal description of its abilities involving multiple caveats about the mistakes it makes or the incredible costs of running it. Generative AI exists for two reasons: to cost money, and to make executives look busy. It was meant to be the new enterprise software and the new iPhone and the new Netflix all at once, a panacea where software guys pay one hardware guy for GPUs to unlock the incredible value creation of the future. Generative AI was always set up to fail, because it was meant to be everything, was talked about like it was everything, is still sold like it’s everything, yet for all the fucking hype, it all comes down to two companies: OpenAI, and, of course, NVIDIA. NVIDIA was, for a while, living high on the hog. All CEO Jensen Huang had to do every three months was saying “check out these numbers” and the markets and business journalists would squeal with glee, even as he said stuff like “the more you buy the more you save,” in part tipping his head to the (very real and sensible) idea of accelerated computing, but framed within the context of the cash inferno that’s generative AI, seems ludicrous. Huang’s showmanship worked really well for NVIDIA for a while, because for a while the growth was easy. Everybody was buying GPUs. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (and to a lesser extent Apple and Tesla) make up 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue, creating, at least for the first four, a degree of shared mania where everybody justified buying tens of billions of dollars of GPUs a year by saying “the other guy is doing it!” This is one of the major reasons the AI bubble is happening, because people conflated NVIDIA’s incredible sales with “interest in AI,” rather than everybody buying GPUs. Don’t worry, I’ll explain the revenue side a little bit later. We’re here for the long haul. Anyway, NVIDIA is facing a problem — that the only thing that grows forever is cancer. On September 9 2025, the Wall Street Journal said that NVIDIA’s “wow” factor was fading, going from beating analyst estimates in by nearly 21% in its Fiscal Year Q2 2024 earnings to scraping by with a mere 1.52% beat in its most-recent earnings — something that for any other company, would be a good thing, but framed against the delusional expectations that generative AI has inspired, is a figure that looks nothing short of ominous. Per the Wall Street Journal: In any other scenario, 56% year-over-year growth would lead to an abundance of Dom Perignon and Huang signing hundreds of boobs, but this is NVIDIA, and that’s just not good enough. Back in February 2024, NVIDIA was booking 265% year-over-year growth, but in its February 2025 earnings, NVIDIA only grew by a measly 78% year-over-year. It isn’t so much that NVIDIA isn’t growing, but that to grow year-over-year at the rates that people expect is insane. Life was a lot easier when NVIDIA went from $6.05 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2023 to $22 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2024, but for it to grow even 55% year-over-year from Q2 FY2026 ($46.7 billion) to Q2 2027 would require it to make $72.385 billion in revenue in the space of three months, mostly from selling GPUs (which make up around 88% of its revenue). This would put Nvidia in the ballpark of Microsoft ($76 billion in the last quarter) and within the neighborhood of Apple ($94 billion in the last quarter), predominantly making money in an industry that a year-and-a-half ago barely made the company $6 billion in a quarter. And the market needs NVIDIA to perform, as the company makes up 8% of the value of the S&P 500. It’s not enough for it to be wildly profitable, or have a monopsony on selling GPUs, or for it to have effectively 10x’d their stock in a few years. It must continue to grow at the fastest rate of anything ever, making more and more money selling these GPUs to a small group of companies that immediately start losing money once they plug them in. While a few members of the Magnificent Seven could be depended on to funnel tens of billions of dollars into a furnace each quarter, there were limits, even for companies like Microsoft, which had bought over 485,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. To take a step back, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make their money by either selling access to Large Language Models that people incorporate into their products, or by renting out servers full of GPUs to run inference (as said previously, the process to generate an output by a model or series of models) or train AI models for companies that develop and market models themselves, namely Anthropic and OpenAI. The latter revenue stream of which is where Jensen Huang found a solution to that eternal growth problem: the neocloud, namely CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius. These businesses are fairly straightforward. They own (or lease) data centers that they then fill full of servers that are full of NVIDIA GPUs, which they then rent on an hourly basis to customers, either on a per-GPU basis or in large batches for larger customers, who guarantee they'll use a certain amount of compute and sign up to long-term (i.e. more than an hour at a time) commitments. A neocloud is a specialist cloud compute company that exists only to provide access to GPUs for AI, unlike Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which have healthy businesses selling other kinds of compute, with AI (as I’ll get into later) failing to provide much of a return on investment. It’s not just the fact that these companies are more specialized than, say, Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft Azure. As you’ve gathered from the name, these are new, young, and in almost all cases, incredibly precarious businesses — each with financial circumstances that would make a Greek finance minister blush. That’s because setting up a neocloud is expensive. Even if the company in question already has data centers — as CoreWeave did with its cryptocurrency mining operation — AI requires completely new data center infrastructure to house and cool the GPUs, and those GPUs also need paying for, and then there’s the other stuff I mentioned earlier, like power, water, and the other bits of the computer (the CPU, the motherboard, the memory and storage, and the housing). As a result, these neoclouds are forced to raise billions of dollars in debt, which they collateralize using the GPUs they already have, along with contracts from customers, which they use to buy more GPUs. CoreWeave, for example, has $25 billion in debt on estimated revenues of $5.35 billion, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. You know who also invests in these neoclouds? NVIDIA! NVIDIA is also one of CoreWeave’s largest customers (accounting for 15% of its revenue in 2024), and just signed a deal to buy $6.3 billion of any capacity that CoreWeave can’t otherwise sell to someone else through 2032, an extension of a $1.3 billion 2023 deal reported by the Information. It was the anchor investor ($250 million) in CoreWeave’s IPO, too. NVIDIA is currently doing the same thing with Lambda, another neocloud that NVIDIA invested in, which also plans to go public next year. NVIDIA is also one of Lambda’s largest customers, signing a deal with it this summer to rent 10,000 GPUs for $1.3 billion over four years. In the UK, NVIDIA has just invested $700 million in Nscale, a former crypto miner that has never built an AI data center, and that has, despite having no experience, committed $1 billion (and/or 100,000 GPUs) to an OpenAI data center in Norway. On Thursday, September 25, Nscale announced it had closed another funding round, with NVIDIA listed as a main backer — although it’s unclear how much money it put in. It would be safe to assume it’s another few hundred million. NVIDIA also invested in Nebius, an outgrowth of Russian conglomerate Yandex, and Nebius provides, through a partnership with NVIDIA, tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of compute credits to companies in NVIDIA’s Inception startup program. NVIDIA’s plan is simple: fund these neoclouds, let these neoclouds load themselves up with debt, at which point they buy GPUs from NVIDIA, which can then be used as collateral for loans, along with contracts from customers, allowing the neoclouds to buy even more GPUs. It’s like that Robinhood infinite money glitch… …except, that is, for one small problem. There don’t appear to be that many customers. As I went into recently on my premium newsletter, NVIDIA funds and sustains Neoclouds as a way of funnelling revenue to itself, as well as partners like Supermicro and Dell, resellers that take NVIDIA GPUs and put them in servers to sell pre-built to customers. These two companies made up 39% of NVIDIA’s revenues last quarter. Yet when you remove hyperscaler revenue — Microsoft, Amazon, Google, OpenAI and NVIDIA — from the revenues of these neoclouds, there’s barely $1 billion in revenue combined, across CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda. CoreWeave’s $5.35 billion revenue is predominantly made up of its contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft (offering compute for OpenAI), Google (hiring CoreWeave to offer compute for OpenAI), and OpenAI itself, which has promised CoreWeave $22.4 billion in business over the next few years. This is all a lot of stuff, so I’ll make it really simple: there is no real money in offering AI compute, but that isn’t Jensen Huang’s problem, so he will simply force NVIDIA to hand money to these companies so that they have contracts to point to when they raise debt to buy more NVIDIA GPUs. Neoclouds are effectively giant private equity vehicles that exist to raise money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, or for hyperscalers to move money around so that they don’t increase their capital expenditures and can, as Microsoft did earlier in the year, simply walk away from deals they don’t like. Nebius’ “$17.4 billion deal” with Microsoft even included a clause in its 6-K filing that Microsoft can terminate the deal in the event the capacity isn’t built by the delivery dates, and Nebius has already used the contract to raise $3 billion to… build the data center to provide compute for the contract. Here, let me break down the numbers: From my analysis, it appears that CoreWeave, despite expectations to make that $5.35 billion this year, has only around $500 million of non-Magnificent Seven or OpenAI AI revenue in 2025, with Lambda estimated to have around $100 million in AI revenue, and Nebius around $250 million without Microsoft’s share, and that’s being generous. In simpler terms, the Magnificent Seven is the AI bubble, and the AI bubble exists to buy more GPUs, because (as I’ll show) there’s no real money or growth coming out of this, other than in the amount that private credit is investing — “$50 billion a quarter, for the low end, for the past three quarters.” I dunno man, let’s start simple: $50 billion a quarter of data center funding is going into an industry that has less revenue than Genshin Impact. That feels pretty bad. Who’s gonna use these data centers? How are they going to even make money on them? Private equity firms don’t typically hold onto assets, they sell them or take them public. Doesn’t seem great to me! Anyway, if AI was truly the next big growth vehicle, neoclouds would be swimming in diverse global revenue streams. Instead, they’re heavily-centralized around the same few names, one of which (NVIDIA) directly benefits from their existence not as a company doing business, but as an entity that can accrue debt and spend money on GPUs. These Neoclouds are entirely dependent on a continual flow of private credit from firms like Goldman Sachs (Nebius, CoreWeave, Lambda for its IPO), JPMorgan (Lambda, Crusoe, CoreWeave), and Blackstone (Lambda, CoreWeave), who have in a very real sense created an entire debt-based infrastructure to feed billions of dollars directly to NVIDIA, all in the name of an AI revolution that's yet to arrive. The fact that the rest of the neocloud revenue stream is effectively either a hyperscaler or OpenAI is also concerning. Hyperscalers are, at this point, the majority of data center capital expenditures, and have yet to prove any kind of success from building out this capacity, outside, of course, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which has succeeded in generating revenue while burning billions of dollars. Hyperscaler revenue is also capricious, but even if it isn’t, why are there no other major customers? Why, across all of these companies, does there not seem to be one major customer who isn’t OpenAI? The answer is obvious: nobody that wants it can afford it, and those who can afford it don’t need it. It’s also unclear what exactly hyperscalers are doing with this compute, because it sure isn’t “making money.” While Microsoft makes $10 billion in revenue from renting compute to OpenAI via Microsoft Azure, it does so at-cost, and was charging OpenAI $1.30-per-hour for each A100GPU it rents, a loss of $2.2 an hour per GPU, meaning that it is likely losing money on this compute, especially as SemiAnalysis has the total cost per hour per GPU at around $1.46 with the cost of capital and debt associated for a hyperscaler, though it’s unclear if that’s for an H100 or A100 GPU. In any case, how do these neoclouds pay for their debt if the hyperscalers give up, or NVIDIA doesn’t send them money, or, more likely, private credit begins to notice that there’s no real revenue growth outside of circular compute deals with neoclouds’ largest supplier, investor and customer? They don’t! In fact, I have serious concerns that they can’t even build the capacity necessary to fulfil these deals, but nobody seems to worry about that. No, really! It appears to be taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of compute capacity. How exactly are any of these neoclouds (or Oracle itself) able to expand to actually capture this revenue? Who knows! But I assume somebody is going to say “OpenAI!” Here’s an insane statistic for you: OpenAI will account for — in both its own revenue (projected $13 billion) and in its own compute costs ($16 billion, according to The Information, although that figure is likely out of date, and seemingly only includes the compute it’ll use, and not that it has committed to build, and thus has spent money on) — about 50% of all AI revenues in 2025. That figure takes into account the $400m ARR for ServiceNow, Adobe, and Salesforce; the $35bn in revenue for the Magnificent Seven from AI (not profit, and based on figures from the previous year); revenue from neoclouds like CoreWeave, Nebius, and Lambda; and the estimated revenue from the entire generative AI industry (including Anthropic and other smaller players, like Perplexity and Anysphere) for a total of $55bn.OpenAI is the generative AI industry — and it’s a dog of a company. As a reminder, OpenAI has leaked that it’ll burn $115 billion in the next four years, and based on my estimates, it needs to raise more than $290 billion in the next four years based on its $300 billion deal with Oracle alone. That alone is a very, very bad sign, especially as we’re three years and $500 billion or more into this hype cycle with few signs of life outside of, well, OpenAI promising people money. Credit to Anthony Restaino for this horrifying graphic: This is not what a healthy, stable industry looks like. Alright, well, things can’t be that bad on the software side. Right? Right? As I covered on my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, everybody is losing money on generative AI, in part because the cost of running AI models is increasing, and in part because the software itself doesn’t do enough to warrant the costs associated with running them, which are already subsidized and unprofitable for the model providers. Outside of OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Anthropic), nobody seems to be making much revenue, with the most “successful” company being Anysphere, makers of AI coding tool Cursor, which hit $500 million ‘annualized” (so $41.6 million in one month) a few months ago, just before Anthropic and OpenAI jacked up the prices for “priority processing” on enterprise queries, raising its operating costs as a result. In any case, that’s some piss-poor revenue for an industry that’s meant to be the future of software. Smartwatches are projected to make $32 billion this year, and as mentioned, the Magnificent Seven expects to make $35 billion or so in revenue from AI this year. Even Anthropic and OpenAI seem a little lethargic, both burning billions of dollars while making, by my estimates, no more than $2 billion and $6.26 billion in 2025 so far, despite projections of $5 billion and $13 billion respectively. Outside of these two, AI startups are floundering, struggling to stay alive and raising money in several-hundred million dollar bursts as their negative-gross-margin businesses flounder. As I dug into a few months ago, I could find only 12 AI-powered companies making more than $8.3 million a month, with two of them slightly improving their revenues, specifically AI search company Perplexity (which has now hit $150 million ARR, or $12.5 million in a month) and AI coding startup Replit (which also hit $150 million ARR in September). Both of these companies burn ridiculous amounts of money. Perplexity burned 164% of its revenue on Amazon Web Services, OpenAI and Anthropic last year, and while Replit hasn’t leaked its costs, The Information reports its gross margins in July were 23%, which doesn’t include the costs of its free users, which you simply have to do with LLMs as free users are capable of costing you a hell of a lot of money. Problematically, your paid users can also cost you more than they bring in as well. In fact, every user loses you money in generative AI, because it’s impossible to do cost control in a consistent manner. A few months ago, I did a piece about Anthropic losing money on every single Claude Code subscriber, and I’ll walk you through it in a very simplified fashion: Anthropic is, to be clear, the second-largest model developer, and has some of the best AI talent in the industry. It has a better handle on its infrastructure than anyone outside of big tech and OpenAI. It still cannot seem to fix this problem, even with weekly rate limits. While one could assume that Anthropic is simply letting people run wild, my theory is far simpler: even the model developers have no real way of limiting user activity, likely due to the architecture of generative AI. I know it sounds insane, but at the most advanced level, model providers are still prompting their models, and whatever rate limits may be in place appear to, at times, get completely ignored, and there doesn’t seem to be anything they can do to stop it. No, really. Anthropic counts amongst its capitalist apex predators one lone Chinese man who spent $50,000 of their compute in the space of a month fucking around with Claude Code. Even if Anthropic was profitable — it isn’t, and will burn billions this year — a customer paying $200-a-month running up $50,000 in costs immediately devours the margin of any user running the service that day, if not that week or month. Even if Anthropic’s costs are half the published rates, one guy amounted to 125 users’ monthly revenue. That’s not a real business! That’s a bad business with out-of-control costs, and it doesn’t appear anybody has these costs under control. A few weeks ago, Replit — an unprofitable AI coding company — released a product called “Agent 3.” which promised to be “10x more autonomous” and offer “infinitely more possibilities,” “[testing] and [fixing] its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop.” In reality, this means you’d go and tell the model to build something and it would “go do it,” and you’ll be shocked to hear that these models can’t be relied upon to “go and do” anything. Please note that this was launched a few months after Replit raised its prices, shifting to obfuscated “effort-based” pricing that would charge “the full scope of the agent’s work.” Agent 3 has been a disaster. Users found tasks that previously cost a few dollars were spiralling into the hundreds of dollars, with The Register reporting one customer found themselves with a $1000 bill after a week: Another user complained that “costs skyrocketed, without any concrete results”: As I previously reported, in late May/early June, both OpenAI and Anthropic cranked up the pricing on their enterprise customers, leading to Replit and Cursor both shifting their prices. This abuse has now trickled down to their customers. Replit has now released an update that lets you choose how autonomous you want Agent 3 to be, which is a tacit admission that you can’t trust coding LLMs to build software. Replit’s users are still pissed off, complaining that Replit is charging them for activity when the agent doesn’t do anything, a consistent problem across its Reddit. While Reddit is not the full summation of all users across every company, it’s a fairly good barometer of user sentiment, and man, are users pissy. Traditionally, Silicon Valley startups have relied upon the same model of “grow really fast and burn a bunch of money, then “turn the profit lever.” AI does not have a “profit lever,” because the raw costs of providing access to AI models are so high (and they’re only increasing) that the basic economics of how the tech industry sells software don’t make sense. I’ll reiterate something I wrote a few weeks ago: In simpler terms, it is very, very difficult to imagine what one user — free or otherwise — might cost, and thus it’s hard to charge them on a monthly basis, or tell them what a service might cost them on average. This is a huge problem with AI coding environments. According to The Information, Claude Code was driving “nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from a few weeks ago” on July 31 2025. That annualized revenue works out to about $33 million a month in revenue for a company that predicts it will make at least $416 million a month by the end of the year, and for a product that has become the most-popular coding environment in the world, from the second-largest and best-funded AI company in the world. …is that it? Is that all that’s happening here? $33 million dollars, all of it unprofitable, after it felt, at least based on social media chatter and discussing with multiple different software engineers, that Claude Code had become ubiquitous with anything to do with LLMs. To be clear, Anthropic’s Sonnet and Opus models are consistently some of the most popular for programming on Openrouter, an aggregator of LLM usage, and Anthropic has been consistently-named as “the best at coding.” Some bright spark out there is going to say that Microsoft’s Github Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and guess what, that’s true, and in fact, I reported it! Here’s another fun fact: the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft loses “on average more than $20-a-month-per-user,” with “...some users [costing] the company as much as $80.” And that’s for the most-popular product! If you believe the New York Times or other outlets that simply copy and paste whatever Dario Amodei says, you’d think that the reason that software engineers are having trouble finding work is because their jobs are being replaced by AI. This grotesque, abusive, manipulative and offensive lie has been propagated throughout the entire business and tech media without anybody sitting down and asking whether it’s true, or even getting a good understanding of what it is that LLMs can actually do with code. Members of the media, I am begging you, stop doing this. I get it, every asshole is willing to give a quote saying that “coding is dead,” and that every executive is willing to burp out some nonsense about replacing all of their engineers, but I am fucking begging you to either use these things yourself, or speak to people that do. I am not a coder. I cannot write or read code. Nevertheless, I am capable of learning, and have spoken to numerous software engineers in the last few months, and basically reached a consensus of “this is kind of useful, sometimes.” However, one very silly man once said that I don’t speak to people who use these tools, so I went and spoke to three notable, experienced software engineers, and asked them to give me the straight truth about what coding LLMs can do. In simple terms, LLMs are capable of writing code, but can’t do software engineering, because software engineering is the process of understanding, maintaining and executing code to produce functional software, and LLMs do not “learn,” cannot “adapt,” and (to paraphrase Brown), break down the more of your code and variables you ask them to look at at once. It’s very easy to believe that software engineering is just writing code, but the reality is that software engineers maintain software, which includes writing and analyzing code among a vast array of different personalities and programs and problems. Good software engineering harkens back to Brian Merchant’s interviews with translators — while some may believe that translators simply tell you what words mean, true translation is communicating the meaning of a sentence, which is cultural, contextual, regional, and personal, and often requires the exercise of creativity and novel thinking. My editor, Matthew Hughes, gave an example of this in his newsletter: Similarly, coding is not just “a series of text that programs a computer,” but a series of interconnected characters that refers to other software in other places that must also function now and explain, on some level, to someone who has never, ever seen the code before, why it was done this way. This is, by the way, why we are still yet to get any tangible proof that AI is replacing software engineers…because it can’t. Of all the fields supposedly at risk from “AI disruption,” coding feels (or felt) the most tangible, if only because the answer to “can you write code with LLMs” wasn’t an immediate, unilateral no. The media has also been quick to say that AI “writes software,” which is true in the same way that ChatGPT “writes novels”. In reality, LLMs can generate code, and do some software engineering-adjacent tasks, but, like all Large Language Models, break down and go totally insane, hallucinating more as the tasks get more complex. And, as I pointed out earlier, software engineering is not just coding. It involves thinking about problems, finding solutions to novel challenges, designing stuff in a way that can be read and maintained by others, and that’s (ideally) scalable and secure. The whole fucking point of an “AI” is that you hand shit off to it! That’s what they’ve been selling it as! That’s why Jensen Huang told kids to stop learning to code, as with AI, there’s no point. And it was all a lie. Generative AI can’t do the job of a software engineer, and it fails while also costing abominable amounts of money. Coding LLMs seem like magic at first, because they (to quote a conversation with Carl Brown) make the easy things easier, but they also make the harder things harder. They don’t even speed up engineers — they actually make them slower! Yet coding is basically the only obvious use case for LLMs. I’m sure you’re gonna say “but I bet the enterprise is doing well!” and you are so very, very wrong. Before I go any further, let’s establish some facts: All of this is to say that Microsoft has one of the largest commercial software empires in history, thousands (if not tens of thousands) of salespeople, and thousands of companies that literally sell Microsoft services for a living. And it can’t sell AI. A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers. This would amount to, if each of these users paid annually at the full rate of $30-a-month, to about $2.88 billion in annual revenue for a product category that makes $33 billion a fucking quarter. And I must be clear, I am 100% sure these users aren’t all paying $30 a month. The Information reported a few weeks ago that Microsoft has been “reducing the software’s price with more generous discounts on the AI features, according to customers and salespeople,” heavily suggesting discounts had already been happening. Enterprise software is traditionally sold at a discount anyway — or, put a different way, with bulk pricing for those who sign up a bunch of users at once. In fact, I’ve found evidence that it’s been doing this a while, with a 15% discount on annual Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions for orders of 10-to-300 seats mentioned by an IT consultant back in late 2024, and another that’s currently running through September 30, 2025 through Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider program, with up to 2400 licenses discounted if you pay upfront for the year. Microsoft seems to do this a lot, as I found another example of an offer that ran from January 1 2025 through March 31 2025. An “active” user is someone who has taken one action on Copilot in any Microsoft 365 app in the space of 28 days. Now, I know. That word, active. Maybe you’re thinking “Ed, this is like the gym model! There are unpaid licenses that Microsoft is getting paid for!” Fine! Let’s assume that Microsoft also has, based on research that suggests this is the case for all software companies, another 50% — four million — of paid Copilot licenses that aren’t being used. That still makes this 12 million users, which is still a putrid 2.72% conversion rate. So, why aren’t people paying for Copilot? Let’s hear from someone who talked to The Information: Microsoft 365 Copilot has been such a disaster that Microsoft will now integrate Anthropic’s models in an attempt and make them better. Oh, one other thing: sources also confirm GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%. I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August. So, The Information reported a few months ago that Microsoft’s projected AI revenues would be $13 billion, with $10 billion of that from OpenAI, leaving about $3 billion of total revenue across Microsoft 365 Copilot and any other foreseeable feature that Microsoft sells with “AI” on it. This heavily suggests that Microsoft is making somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on Azure or Microsoft 365 Copilot, though I suppose there are other places it could be making AI revenue too. Right? I guess. In any case, Microsoft’s net income (read: profit) in its last quarterly earnings was $27.2 billion. Pathetic. One of the comfortable lies that people tell themselves is that the AI bubble is similar to the fiber boom, or the dot com bubble, or Uber, or that we’re in the “growth stage,” or that “this is what software companies do, they spend a bunch of money then “pull the profit lever.” This is nothing like anything you’ve seen before, because this is the dumbest shit that the tech industry has ever done. AI data centers are nothing like fiber, because there are very few actual use cases for these GPUs outside of AI, and none of them are remotely hyperscale revenue drivers. As I discussed a month or so ago, data center development accounted for more of America’s GDP growth than all consumer spending combined, and there really isn’t any demand for AI in general, let alone at the scale that these hundreds of billions of dollars are being sunk into. The conservative estimate of capital expenditures related to data centers is around $400 billion, but given the $50 billion a quarter in private credit, I’m going to guess it breaks $500 billion, all to build capacity for an industry yet to prove itself. And this NVIDIA-OpenAI “$100 billion funding” news should only fill you full of dread, but also it isn’t fucking finalized, stop reporting it as if it’s done, I swear to god- Anyway, according to CNBC, “the initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized,” with “successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company’s then-current valuation as new capacity comes online.” At no point is anyone asking how, exactly, OpenAI builds data centers to fill full of these GPUs. In fact, I am genuinely shocked (and a little disgusted!) by how poorly this story has been told. Let’s go point by point: To be clear, when I say OpenAI needs at least $300 billion over the next four years, that’s if you believe its projections, which you shouldn’t. Let’s walk through its (alleged) numbers, while plagiarizing myself: According to The Information, here's the breakdown (these are projections): OpenAI's current reported burn is $116 billion through 2030, which means there is no way that these projections include $300 billion in compute costs, even when you factor in revenue. There is simply no space in these projections to absorb that $300 billion, and from what I can tell, by 2029, OpenAI will have actually burned more than $290 billion, assuming that it survives that long, which I do not believe it will. Don’t worry, though. OpenAI is about to make some crazy money. Here are the projections that CFO Sarah Friar signed off on: Just so we are clear, OpenAI intends to 10x its revenue in the space of four years, selling software and access to models in an industry with about $60 billion of revenue in 2025. How will it do this? It doesn’t say. I don’t know OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, but I do know that signing off on these numbers is, at the very least, ethically questionable. Putting aside the ridiculousness of OpenAI’s deals, or its funding requirements, Friar has willfully allowed Sam Altman and OpenAI to state goals that defy reality or good sense, all to take advantage of investors and public markets that have completely lost the plot. I need to be blunter: OpenAI has signed multiple different deals and contracts for amounts it cannot afford to pay, that it cannot hope to raise the money to pay for, that defy the amounts of venture capital and private credit available, all to sustain a company that will burn $300 billion and has no path to profitability of any kind. So, as I said above, CNBC reported on September 23, 2025 that the NVIDIA deal will be delivered in $10 billion tranches, the first of which is “expected to close within a month,” and the rest delivered “as new capacity comes online.” This is, apparently, all part of a plan to build 10GW of data center capacity with NVIDIA. A few key points: So, let’s start simple: data centers take forever to build. As I said previously, based on current reports, it’s taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of data center capacity, and nowhere in these reports does one reporter take a second to say “hey, what data centers are you talking about?” or “hey, didn’t Sam Altman say back in July that he was building 10GW of data center capacity with Oracle?” But wait, now Oracle and OpenAI have done another announcement that says they’re only doing 7GW, but they’re “ahead of schedule” on 10GW? Wait, is NVIDIA’s 10GW the same 10GW as Oracle and OpenAI are working on? Is it different? Nobody seems to know or care! Anyway, I cannot be clear enough how unlikely it is that (as NVIDIA has said) “the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026,” and that’s if it has bought the land and got the permits and ordered the construction, none of which has happened yet. But let’s get really specific on costs! Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI is a $15 billion joint venture, which means a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion. Abilene’s eight buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs. Though this math is a little funky due to NVIDIA promising to install its new Rubin GPUs in these theoretical data centers, that means these data centers will require a little under $200 billion worth of GPUs. By my maths that’s $325 billion. I’m so tired of this. A number of you have sent me the following image with some sort of comment about how “this is how it’ll work,” and you are wrong, because this is neither how it works nor how it will work nor accurate on any level. In the current relationship, NVIDIA Is Not Sending OpenAI $100 Billion, nor will it send it that much money, because 90% of OpenAI’s funding is gated behind building 9 or 10 gigawatts of data center capacity. In the current relationship, OpenAI does not have the money to pay Oracle. Also, can Oracle even afford to give that much money to NVIDIA? It had negative free cash flow last quarter, already has $104 billion in debt, and its biggest new customer cannot afford a single fucking thing it’s promised. The only company in this diagram that actually can afford to do any of this shit is NVIDIA, and even then it only has $56 billion cash on hand. In any case, as I went over on Friday, OpenAI has promised about a trillion dollars between compute contracts across Oracle, Microsoft, Google and CoreWeave, 17 Gigawatts of promised data centers in America between NVIDIA and “Stargate,” several more gigawatts of international data centers, custom chips from Broadcom, and their own company operations. How exactly does this get paid for? Nobody seems to ask these questions! Why am I the asshole doing this? Don’t we have tech analysts that are meant to analyse shit? AHhhhh- Every time I sit down to write about this subject the newsletters seem to get longer, because people are so painfully attached to the norms and tropes of the past. This post is, already, 17,500 words — a record for this newsletter — and I’ve still not finished editing and expanding it. What we’re witnessing is one of the most egregious wastes of capital in history, sold by career charlatans with their reputations laundered by a tech and business media afraid to criticize the powerful and analysts that don’t seem to want to tell their investors the truth. There are no historic comparisons here — even Britain’s abominable 1800s railway bubble, which absorbed half of the country’s national income, created valuable infrastructure for trains, a vehicle that can move people to and from places. GPUs are not trains, nor are they cars, or even CPUs. They are not adaptable to many other kinds of work, nor are they “the infrastructure of the future of tech,” because they’re already quite old and with everybody focused on buying them, you’d absolutely see one other use case by now that actually mattered. GPUs are expensive, power-hungry, environmentally destructive and require their own kinds of cooling and server infrastructure, making every GPU data center and environmental and fiscal bubble unto themselves. And, whereas the Victorian train infrastructure still exists in the UK — though it has been upgraded over the years — a GPU has a limited useful lifespan. These are cards that can — and will — break after a period of extended usage, whether that period is five years or later, and they’ll inevitably be superseded by something better and more powerful, meaning that the resale value of that GPU will only go down, with a price depreciation that’s akin to a new car. I am telling you, as I have been telling you for years, again and again and again, that the demand is not there for generative AI, and the demand is never, ever arriving. The only reason anyone humours any of this crap is the endless hoarding of GPUs to build capacity for a revolution that will never arrive. Well, that and OpenAI, a company built and sold on lies about ChatGPT’s capabilities. ChatGPT’s popularity — and OpenAI’s hunger for endless amounts of compute — have created the illusion of demand due to the sheer amount of capacity required to keep their services operational, all so they can burn $8 billion or more in 2025 and, if my estimates are right, nearly a trillion dollars by 2030. This NVIDIA deal is a farce — an obvious attempt by the largest company on the American stock market to prop up the one significant revenue-generator in the entire industry, knowing that time is running out for it to create new avenues for eternal growth. I’d argue that NVIDIA’s deal also shows the complete contempt that these companies have for the media. There are no details about how this deal works beyond the initial $10 billion, there’s no land purchased, no data center construction started, and yet the media slurps it down without a second thought. I am but one man, and I am fucking peculiar. I did not learn financial analysis in school, but I appear to be one of the few people doing even the most basic analysis of these deals, and while I’m having a great time doing so, I am also exceedingly frustrated at how little effort is being put into prying apart these deals. I realize how ridiculous all of this sounds. I get it. There’s so much money being promised to so many people, market rallies built off the back of massive deals, and I get that the assumption is that this much money can’t be wrong, that this many people wouldn’t just say stuff without intending to follow through, or without considering whether their company could afford it. I know it’s hard to conceive that hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested in something for no apparent reason, but it’s happening, right god damn now, in front of your eyes, and I am going to be merciless on anyone who attempts to write a “how could we see this coming?” Generative AI has never been reliable, has always been unprofitable, and has always been unsustainable, and I’ve been saying so since February 2024. The economics have never made sense, something I’ve said repeatedly since April 2024, and when I wrote “How Does OpenAI Survive?” in July 2024, I had multiple people suggest I was being alarmist. Here’s some alarmism for you: the longer it takes for OpenAI to die, the more damage it will cause to the tech industry. On Friday, when I put out my piece on OpenAI needing a trillion dollars, I asked analyst Gil Luria if the capital was there to build the 17 Gigawatts that OpenAI had allegedly planned to build. He said the following: That doesn’t sound good! Anyway, as I discussed earlier, venture capital could run out in six quarters, with investor and researcher Jon Sakoda estimating that there will only be around $164 billion of dry powder (available capital) in US VC firms by the end of 2025. In July, The French Tech Journal reported (using Pitchbook data) that global venture capital deal activity reached its lowest first-half total since 2018, with $139.4 billion in deal value in the first half of 2025, down from $183.4 billion in the first half of 2024, meaning that any further expansion or demands for venture capital from OpenAI will likely sap the dwindling funds available from other startups. Things get worse when you narrow things to US venture capital. In a piece from April, EY reported that VC-backed investment in US companies hit $80 billion in Q1 2025, but “one $40 billion deal” accounted for half of the investment — OpenAI’s $40 billion deal of which only $10 billion has actually closed, and that didn’t happen until fucking June. Without the imaginary money from OpenAI, US venture would have declined by 36%. The longer that OpenAI survives, the longer it will sap the remaining billions from the tech ecosystem, and I expect it to extend its tendrils to private credit too. The $325 billion it needs just to fulfil its NVIDIA contract, albeit over 4 years, is an egregious sum that I believe exceeds the available private capital in the world. Let’s get specific, and check out the top 10 private equity firms’ available capital! Assuming that all of this capital is currently available, the top 10 private equity firms in the world have around $477 billion of available capital. We can, of course, include investment banks — Goldman Sachs had around $520 billion cash in hand available at the end of its last quarter, and JPMorgan over $1.7 trillion, but JP Morgan has only dedicated $50 billion in direct lending commitments as of February 2025, and while Goldman Sachs expanded its direct private credit lending by $15 billion back in June, that appears to be an extension of its “more than $20 billion” direct lending close from mid-2024. Include both of those, and that brings us up to — if we assume that all of these funds are available — $562 billion in capital and about $164 billion in US venture available to spend, and that’s meant to go to more places than just OpenAI. Sure, sure, there’s more than just the top 10 private equity firms and there’s venture money outside of the US, but what could it be? Like, another $150 billion? You see, OpenAI needs to buy those GPUs, and it needs to build those data centers, and it needs to pay its thousands of staff and marketing and sales costs too. While OpenAI likely wouldn’t be the ones raising the money for the data centers — and honestly, I’m not sure who would do it at this point? — somebody is going to need to build TWENTY GIGAWATTS OF DATA CENTERS if we’re to believe both Oracle and NVIDIA You may argue that venture funds and private credit can raise more, and you’re right! But at this point, there have been few meaningful acquisitions of AI companies, and zero exits from the billions of dollars put into data centers. Even OpenAI admits in its own announcement about new Stargate sites that this will be a “$400 billion investment over 3 years.” Where the fuck is that money coming from? Is OpenAI really going to absorb massive chunks of all available private credit and venture capital for the next few years? And no, god, stop saying the US government will bail this out. It will have to bail out hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no scenario where it’s anything less than that, and I’ve already been over this. While the US government has spent equivalent sums in the past to support private business (the total $440 billion dispersed during the Great Recession’s TARP program, where the Treasury bought toxic assets from investment banks to stop them from imploding a la Lehman, springs to mind), it’s hard to imagine any case where OpenAI is seen as vital to the global financial system — and the economic health of the US — as the banking system. Sure, we spent around $1tn — if we’re being specific, $953bn — on the Paycheck Protection Program during the Covid era, but that was to keep people employed at a time when the economy outside of Zoom and Walmart had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist. There was an urgency that doesn’t apply here. If OpenAI goes tits up, Softbank loses some money — nothing new there — and Satya Nadella has to explain why he spent tens of billions of dollars on a bunch of data centers filled with $50,000 GPUs that are, at this point, ornamental. And while there will be — and have been — disastrous economic consequences, they won’t be as systemically catastrophic as that of the pandemic, or the global financial crisis. To be clear, it’ll be bad, but not as bad. And there’s also the problem of moral hazard — if the government steps in, what’s to stop big tech chasing its next fruitless rainbow? — and optics. If people resented bailing out the banks after they acted like profligate gamblers and lost, how will they feel bailing out fucking Sam Altman and Jensen Huang? I do apologize for the length of this piece, but the significance of this bubble requires depth. There is little demand, little real money, and little reason to continue, and the sheer lack of responsibility and willingness to kneel before the powerful fills me full of angry bile. I understand many journalists are not in a position where they can just write “this shit sounds stupid,” but we have entered a deeply stupid era, and by continuing to perpetuate the myth of AI, the media guarantees that retail investors and regular people’s 401Ks will suffer. It is now inevitable that this bubble bursts. Deutsche Bank has said the AI boom is unsustainable outside of tech spending “remaining parabolic,” which it says “is highly unlikely,” and Bain Capital has said that $2 trillion in new revenue is needed to fund AI’s scaling, and even that math is completely fucked as it talks about “AI-related savings”: Even when stared in the face by a ridiculous idea — $2 trillion of new revenue in a global software market that’s expected to be around $817 billion in 2025 — Bain still oinks out some nonsense about the “savings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support and R&D,” yet another myth perpetuated I assume to placate the fucking morons sinking billions into this. Every single “vibe coding is the future,” “the power of AI,” and “AI job loss” story written perpetuates a myth that will only lead to more regular people getting hurt when the bubble bursts. Every article written about OpenAI or NVIDIA or Oracle that doesn’t explicitly state that the money doesn’t exist, that the revenues are impossible, that one of the companies involved burns billions of dollars and has no path to profitability, is an act of irresponsible make believe and mythos. I am nobody. I am not a financier. I am not anybody special. I just write a lot, and read a lot, and can do the most basic maths in the world. I am not trying to be anything other than myself, nor do I have an agenda, other than the fact that I like doing this and I hate how this story is being told. I never planned for this newsletter to get this big, and now that it has, I’m going to keep doing the same thing every week. I also believe that the way to stop this happening again is to have a thorough and well-sourced explanation of everything as it happens, ripping down the narratives as they’re spun and making it clear who benefits from them and how and why they’re choosing to do so. When things collapse, we need to be clear about how many times people chose to look the other way, or to find good faith ways to interpret bad faith announcements and leak.

Title: Trump’s visa fee hike is not the only worry. Hostility mounts for Indian IT in US

Even as US President Donald Trump’s steep hike in H-1B visa fee threatens to hit Indian software services providers, US lawmakers and agencies have separately intensified the scrutiny of the offshoring sector. Homegrown Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the country’s largest information technology (IT) services company, and India-heritage Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. were among the companies targeted by two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley and Democrat Richard J. Durbin, over hiring practices. A third senator, Tom Cotton, is considering bills to reform of H-1B programme, while his Republican peer Bernie Moreno has proposed an HIRE Act to increase taxes on companies offshoring work. Growing scrutiny makes the $283-billion local outsourcing industry even more vulnerable after Trump signed an executive order to increase the one-time fee for H-1B Visas from the current $1,000 to $100,000 starting next year. The target is the alleged misuse of H-1B visas, which enable highly skilled non-immigrants to work in the US temporarily. These permits are issued for three years with an option to renew for up to six years. Indian IT companies accounted for 70% of such visas issued in 2024. "The question is, how impactful are the letters by Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin? In my opinion, very. There could be potential Senate investigations into the issue of H-1B visas, and leaders of all the companies could be called to give sworn testimonies before the Senate," said Russell A. Stamets, a partner at Circle of Counsels, a New Delhi-based law firm. "Indian companies desperately need knowledgeable American voices to help them navigate this, not simply people who have lived in the US for some time. Cultural nuance is critical in these discussions," said Stamets. Last Wednesday, judiciary committee chairman Grassley and Durbin wrote to TCS CEO K Krithivasan and his Cognizant counterpart S Ravi Kumar over their hiring practices. “TCS recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 people worldwide, including American staff. For example, TCS laid off nearly five dozen employees in its Jacksonville office alone last month," read the 24 September letter to Krithivasan. TCS sponsored 5,505 H-1B employees in FY25, the second-largest beneficiary, behind Amazon.com Inc. The senators accused the company of firing Americans and substituting them with H-1B employees. “TCS is already under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American workers in favor of newly hired South-Asian H-1B employees. TCS is doing itself no favors by replacing Americans with H-1Bs while this investigation is ongoing," said the letter. Accused of discriminationThey accused Cognizant of discriminating against white Americans. “Last year, a federal jury concluded that Cognizant intentionally engaged in race-based discrimination by favoring South-Asian H-1B workers over American employees. The jury also found that Cognizant’s conduct warranted punitive damages. Cognizant is doing itself no favors by continuing to replace Americans with H-1B workers on the heels of this verdict," read the 24 September letter to Kumar. Last fiscal, Cognizant received approvals to hire 2,493 H-1B employees, making it the seventh-largest user of these visas. TCS, which follows an April-March financial calendar, ended FY25 with $30.18 billion in revenue, while Cognizant, which follows a January-December financial calendar, generated $19.74 billion in revenue. Also Read | Did Trump just slam the door on Indian doctors and nurses? The senators asked nine questions to both Krithivasan and Kumar, including the reasons behind hiring H-1B employees while laying off their American staff, and whether TCS and Cognizant deliberately hid their H-1B recruitment ads by listing them separately from general hiring ads. The senators also sought answers on whether both companies paid the same salaries and allowed similar benefits to H-1B workers and their American counterparts. TCS and Cognizant have until 10 October to respond to the letter from US lawmakers. Queries emailed to TCS, Cognizant, and senators Grassley and Durbin went unanswered. To be sure, both Grassley and Durbin have been working to introduce more stringent laws that address the H-1B visa issue since 2007. Both also wrote to the remaining eight large beneficiaries of H-1B visas, including Amazon, Apple Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. H-1B reform agendaCotton, meanwhile, said he might introduce two bills that suggest changes to the H-1B program. “President Trump and @SecretaryLCD (Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer) are absolutely right that the H-1B program needs reforms," said Cotton in a 26 September social media post on X. “Next week I’m introducing two bills that will bring badly needed changes to this program and put American workers first." Earlier this month, Moreno, a senator from Ohio, proposed the HIRE legislation, which aims to make outsourcing costlier and reduce reliance on cheap foreign labour. Indian IT firms earn nearly three-fifths of their revenue from the US as large American companies outsource their back-end tech work to homegrown IT services companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro. Offshoring a targetHowever, the HIRE Act may not become law, and even if it did, its impact would be higher on American firms than on homegrown IT service providers, as the tech service providers are expected to pass on the costs to their clients, Mint reported on 10 September, citing conversations with sector experts and analysts. Still, the changing regulatory landscape, coupled with AI, could be a double whammy for Indian tech firms.

Title: Ethereum spot ETFs see record $795 mln outflows: What’s going on?

Are investors turning cautious, or is a bigger trend unfolding in crypto markets? The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) experienced the largest outflows at over $362 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA fund, with more than $200 million exiting. Ethereum traded at $3,990.17, down 0.58% on the day and 10.78% over the past week, reflecting short-term market volatility. Ethereum [ETH] has been making headlines recently, not just for its price movements, but also due to heightened network activity that has drawn investor attention. Yet, despite the buzz, spot Ethereum ETFs faced a historic drain last week, recording their largest weekly outflows on record. Data from Farside Investors shows that for the week ending the 26th of September, these ETFs saw $795.6 million in outflows amid a trading volume surpassing $10 billion. The ETFs just edged out the previous notable week of the 5th of September, which saw $787.7 million exit the funds. BlackRock’s industry-leading ETHA fund saw more than $200 million exit, even though the fund still manages over $15.2 billion in assets. Meanwhile, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), the third-largest Ethereum ETF by assets under management, experienced the largest outflows among its peers, with over $362 million pulled during the same period. Grayscale’s ETHE also reported notable withdrawals, highlighting a broader trend of investor caution in the Ethereum market. The outflows coincided with Ethereum’s price slipping below the $4,000 mark, trading at $3,990.17, down 0.58% on the day and 10.78% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. The retreat in ETF flows mirrors the wider market sentiment, as investors appeared to pull back amid short-term volatility. Weekly outflows across available Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs totaled $902.5 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the pack in withdrawals. Bitcoin itself traded at $109,352.01, reflecting a modest daily decline of 0.02% and a 5.53% drop over the week, according to CoinMarketCap. This coincided with the SEC has postponing decisions on multiple crypto ETF and staking applications, pushing review deadlines into late October and mid-November. Major issuers, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Grayscale, are among those affected. Yet, despite these delays, market optimism remains, with Ripple [XRP] Futures reaching record highs and new filings emerging, such as VanEck’s proposed Spot Hyperliquid ETF and the first U.S.-based Dogecoin [DOGE] ETF.

A MAN WHO has spent forty years tending to the graves of the only two victims of the Air India disaster who were left unclaimed has been honoured by an Indian cultural group in Cork. All 329 passengers and crew on board Air India flight 182 were killed on June 23rd, 1985 when a bomb exploded on board the aircraft as it cruised some 190km off the south west coast of Ireland on route from Montreal to Delhi. The flight was brought down off the coast of Cork. It remains the worst aviation disaster in Irish and Canadian history. Most of the dead were of Indian descent. Annu Alexandra, who was originally from Kerala in India, and her daughter Rena were among the victims. The bodies of her husband and son were never recovered. Finbarr Archer, who is the official driver to the Lord Mayor of Cork city, was working for an undertaker at the time of the terrorist attack. He was tasked with documenting details of the 132 bodies which were recovered. He realised there was nobody left to claim the bodies of Annu and Rena. Mother and daughter were subsequently buried together in a single grave in St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock in Cork city. Advertisement Along with tending to their grave Mr Archer organises an annual commemorative ceremony at the cemetery to coincide with the anniversary of the Air India disaster. Cork Sarbojonin Durgotsab (CSD) yesterday presented its first-ever Shamrock Lotus Award, to Mr Archer citing his “extraordinary compassion, humanity, and service to society.” “This award recognises his decades-long devotion in caring for the grave of an Indian mother and daughter lost in the Air India Flight 182 tragedy, reflecting unwavering dedication, compassion, and humanity that inspire our entire Indian community. “His actions embody the spirit of selfless service, community bonding and the profound impact one individual can have in honouring others. “May this award, uniting the shamrock of Ireland and the lotus of India, forever remind us that kindness knows no borders and remembrance has no end.” Meanwhile, on 23 June some sixty relatives of the victims were among those who attended a ceremony in Ahakista in West Cork to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Air India crash. A remembrance ceremony takes places annually in the village of Ahakista which is the nearest point on land to the crash site. Following the ceremony, family members laid wreaths at a monument which bears the names of all those who died. The plane crash led to the biggest search and recovery operation ever mounted by the State.

A Cork man has been honoured by the Indian community for tending to the graves, for 40 years, of the only two victims of the Air India disaster to be buried in Ireland following the terrorist attack which claimed the lives of 329 people off the Irish coast in 1985. Finbarr Archer was described as “a light of kindness in Ireland” at a presentation by the Cork Sarbojonin Durgotsab (CSD) for his work tending the graves of Annu and Rena Alexandra who died in the tragedy. Mr Archer, who now works as the official driver to the Lord Mayor of Cork, was working with O’Sullivans Undertakers in Cork in 1985 and was tasked with documenting the details of the 132 bodies that were recovered from the sea off the southwest coast. When he discovered that there was no one to claim the bodies of Annu Alexandra and her young daughter, Rena, as her husband and son also perished in the bomb attack, Mr Archer arranged for their bodies to be buried together in a single grave at St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock, Cork. Since the burial, for the past 40 years, Mr Archer has tended the grave and organised commemorations each June 23rd to mark the anniversary of the Air India atrocity. This weekend, he was honoured for his work by the Indian community in Cork as part of their Hindu Durga Puja celebrations. The CSD, a group that celebrates members of the Indian community in Cork, held a special ceremony on Saturday in which they presented Mr Archer with its first ever Shamrock Lotus Award. Speaking at the presentation, Nivedita Basu, of CSD, said: “Today we salute and are honoured to recognise Finbarr Archer, whose gentle care and remembrance for the family of Annu Alexander, lost in the Air India Flight 182 tragedy for four decades, have been a light of kindness in Ireland. [ Cathy Dillon: A reporter remembers the Air India Disaster of June 23rd, 1985Opens in new window ] “This award recognises Finbarr’s decades-long devotion in caring for the grave of an Indian mother and daughter lost in the Air India Flight 182 tragedy, reflecting unwavering dedication, compassion, and humanity that inspire our entire Indian community. “With no family here to take Annu and her little daughter, Rena, Finbarr stepped forward and gave them a resting place in Blackrock and for 40 years he has cared for the grave, holding memorials and keeping their memory alive so even though far from home, they are never forgotten. “His actions embody the spirit of selfless service, community bonding and the profound impact one individual can have in honouring others. May this award, uniting the shamrock of Ireland and the lotus of India, forever remind us that kindness knows no borders and remembrance has no end.” Accepting the award from Cllr Dan Boyle, deputising for Lord Mayor of Cork, Cllr Fergal Dennehy, Mr Archer said he was deeply humbled by the honour but all he was endeavouring to do was ensure that Annu and Rena and their other family members lost in Air India would not be forgotten. [ Victims of Air India bombing remembered at dignified 40th anniversary ceremony in CorkOpens in new window ] “It’s deeply humbling and a great honour to be here and to remember Rena and her mother, Alexander – it’s something that I’ve done since they were buried in Blackrock – every year the emergency services involved in Air India gather to remember them so they will never be forgotten. “They may rest now far from India, but they are not far from home, they are with us, and they are with the people of Cork and with the Indian community - I would like to thank too all the emergency service personnel who come every year for the memorial to remember Annu and Rena.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! The autonomous vehicle industry is years — maybe decades — from maturing. And so there’s still a Wild West quality to the sector, in spite of the steady stream of announcements that do show marked progress. Two such news items from this week illustrate my point of progress, possibility, and even a bit of peril (at least to the ups and downs a public market can provide). First up is Gatik, an AV and logistics startup that is applying its tech to middle-mile trucks. The startup, which I first wrote about in 2019, announced a multi-year and expanded commercial partnership with Canada’s largest retailer, Loblaw. Under the deal, Gatik will deploy 20 autonomous trucks by the end of 2025 to provide driverless delivery to Loblaw’s network of stores in the greater Toronto area. Co-founder and CEO Gautam Narang told me the company will add another 30 autonomous trucks to the fleet by the end of 2026. The deal is notable, and not just because of the fleet size. As Narang explained to me, the trucks will be handling the full regional network for Loblaw. This means these third-generation AV trucks will operate autonomously to pick up products from two distribution centers and make deliveries to over 300 retail stores. “These are multiple brands within the Loblaw umbrella,” he said. In other words, this is not some fixed-route pilot program. It’s commercial, and it’s complex. Next up is Kodiak Robotics, another startup I have reported on since its founding. The company, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, began trading on Nasdaq this week under the tickers KDK and KDKRW. The company, which is now called Kodiak AI, went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II, an affiliate of Ares Management. The deal valued the startup at about $2.5 billion. Kodiak raised $275 million in financing. More than $212.5 million came from certain institutional investors, including $145 million in PIPE funding and about $62.9 million in trust cash from Ares. It should be noted that the trust cash is smaller (it was $562 million), as some SPAC investors redeemed their shares. I spoke to founder and CEO Don Burnette the day before Kodiak’s big debut about why he took the company public — let alone via a SPAC. It was a big moment for Burnette, whose family was on hand to watch him ring the bell and mark the milestone. The stock was trading at about $7.70 Friday, down about 10% from its market open. “As you can imagine, building and scaling a transformative autonomous driving company is very capital intensive, and we were looking to access the public markets as a path forward for the company. And when choosing between, you know, traditional IPO or a SPAC, we considered all the options,” he said. “We felt like, from a timing perspective, it was the right decision for the company (to take the SPAC route).” It should be noted that Burnette is also quite bullish on defense. Here’s why: “I think autonomy is the future of ground transportation broadly,” he said, before noting the benefits within defense for logistics and reconnaissance operations for ground vehicles. “One of the key things is defense requires unstructured autonomy, and this is one of the areas where we become specialists.” A few weeks ago, we wrote about some trouble at Hyundai‘s electric air taxi startup Supernal, including that the company had stopped work on its air taxi program and that its CEO and CTO were out. This week, a little bird told us that a wider reorg of Supernal’s C-suite was afoot — something Hyundai Motor Group has now confirmed to us. Chief strategy officer Jaeyong Song and chief safety officer Tracy Lamb are part of a “transition to new leadership,” according to the Korean conglomerate. Song’s departure is particularly notable, as he was once the VP of Hyundai’s Advanced Air Mobility division, which Supernal was spun out of in 2021. Also gone is Lina Yang, who most recently served as chief of staff to the startup’s now-former CEO, but who also served as Supernal’s “Head of Intelligent Systems” before that. Got a tip for us?

Remember Moxion Power, the portable battery startup that raised $110 million before going bankrupt? The founders are back with a new startup called Anode Technology Company, which has designed a mobile battery and inverter that can be used for EV charging and supplying remote power to construction sites and live events. The startup just raised $9 million in seed funding in a round led by Eclipse Ventures; its partner, Jiten Behl, who spearheaded the deal, was previously Rivian’s chief growth officer. Apparently, Behl’s interest was sparked by his experience at Rivian. Side note: Palo Alto-based venture capital firm Eclipse sure has been busy this year. The VC firm led the $105 million round of Also, the micromobility startup that spun out of Rivian, and recently hired longtime T. Rowe Price Group investor Joe Fath as partner and head of growth. The firm doesn’t explicitly focus on transportation, but some of its portfolio companies in this sector include Arc, Bedrock Robotics, Reliable Robotics, Skyryse, and Wayve. Other deals that got my attention … Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India that competes with Uber, doubled its valuation to $2.3 billion following a secondary share sale by food delivery giant Swiggy. The share sale comes just weeks after Rapido began piloting food deliveries, edging into Swiggy’s core territory. Telo, the tiny electric truck developer, raised $20 million in a Series A funding round co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo’s board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and early-stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo. TheTrump administration is seeking up to a 10% stake in Lithium Americas in exchange for renegotiating the repayment period of a $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan. GM is a major investor in the Canadian company, which is developing a lithium mine in Nevada that is expected to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Hackers have had quite an active week in the transportation sector. Stellantis confirmed a data breach involving customers’ personal information. The breach is linked to a hack of its Salesforce database. Meanwhile, a hack that began last Friday and targeted check-in systems provided by Collins Aerospace caused delays at Brussels, Berlin, and Dublin airports, as well as London’s Heathrow. The U.K.’s National Crime Agency has arrested a man in connection to the ransomware attack. And finally, Jaguar Land Rover said it will not resume production at its factories for yet another week as it continues to grapple with fallout from a cyberattack. Battery materials startup Sila started operations at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, a milestone that could pave the way for longer-range, faster-charging EVs. The factory is the first large-scale silicon anode factory in the West and will initially be capable of making enough battery materials for 20,000 to 50,000 EVs. Future expansion could fulfill demand for as many as 2.5 million vehicles. Automakers continue to pull back on EVs and electrified vehicles. Honda is ending U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle that was being built by General Motors in Tennessee, CNBC reported. And Stellantis has canceled plans to produce a 4xe plug-in hybrid Jeep Gladiator in North America by the end of 2025. Which EV is next on the chopping block? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Rivian over issues with the seat belts in its electric delivery vans that could introduce additional risk in the event of a crash, Bloomberg reported. Tesla asked the Environmental Protection Agency not to roll back current vehicle emissions standards, breaking from other major automakers that want to see the rules eased. TuneIn, an audio streaming service, is collaborating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deliver emergency alerts directly to drivers. Volvo Cars is pledging a commitment to U.S. production. The company said it will continue to invest in its U.S. car plant near Charleston, South Carolina, and announced plans to expand the factory to produce a hybrid vehicle by the end of the decade. Waymo launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. Zoox has asked federal regulators for an exemption that would allow the Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle company to commercially deploy its custom-built robotaxis, which lack traditional controls like pedals and a steering wheel. Finally, proof of life from Luminar founder Austin Russell. You may remember that Russell was mysteriously and suddenly replaced in May as CEO of the lidar company he created. The company has never truly explained his departure, only that it was the result of a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” initiated by the board. Russell has been silent; while he remains on Luminar’s board, he hasn’t signed any of the filings the company has submitted with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since he was replaced. This week, he reappeared as the co-founder of a new company called Russell AI Labs. It’s billed as a “platform that backs and builds transformative AI and frontier technology companies.” It doesn’t seem like his troubles at Luminar have affected his ability to attract high-profile support or make eyebrow-raising deals. Russell’s co-founders are Markus Schäfer, CTO and board member at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Murtaza Ahmed, who served as a managing director at Goldman Sachs before joining SoftBank and was a partner in the $100 billion Vision Fund and managing partner of its $5 billion Latin America Fund. As part of Russell AI Lab’s debut, the startup announced it has taken a $300 million stake in agentic AI company Emergence AI.

Title: 5 ‘Fed-Friendly’ REITs Paying Up To 13%
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/28/5-fed-friendly-reits-paying-up-to-13/
Time Published: 2025-09-28T12:46:00Z

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Fed has finally cut rates, and if the “dot plot” is any indication, it won’t be the last. This is fuel for real estate investment trusts (REITs)—they thrive when borrowing costs fall and their fat dividends shine next to shrinking bond yields. Today we can lock in payouts between 6% and 13% from landlords set to surge as Powell’s long-awaited pivot plays out. Why do REITs rally as rates fall? These stocks act as “bond proxies” that move alongside bonds and opposite rates. Here is a major REIT ETF plotted against the 10-year Treasury yield. As you can see, when the important rate zigs, the REIT benchmark zags: Rate cuts don’t always hit the 10-year overnight. But the direction is now clear—and history shows that REITs rally once the bond market adjusts. So, let’s look at a lineup of landlords yielding up to 13.3% that are ready to ride Powell’s pivot higher. We’ll start with Healthpeak Properties (DOC, 6.5% dividend yield). Healthpeak owns 702 properties across outpatient medical, labs and senior housing. This blend has weighed on 2025 results because labs have been weak. However this “property patient” has perked up since August, when a sad jobs report foreshadowed the September rate cut. In other words, the Fed is driving this rebound: Broadstone Net Lease (BNL, 6.3% dividend yield) specializes in single-tenant commercial properties. Currently, its portfolio is made up of 766 properties in 44 states and four Canadian provinces, leased out to a whopping 205 tenants representing more than 50 industries. Its blend looks a lot different than it did even a year or two ago—Broadstone has been actively shedding healthcare properties, which made up roughly 20% of annualized based rent back in 2024 but now accounts for less than 4% of ABR. Today, industrial makes up roughly 60% of ABR, retail accounts for more than 30%, and office buildings drive most of the remainder. Broadstone deals in “net leases,” where tenants cover taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. BNL just collects rent. Those long-term leases, with built-in 2% rent escalators, deliver the steady cash flows we want from a landlord. I said more than a year ago that although its transformation might weigh on earnings in the short term, “the renewed portfolio focus is a benefit to BNL.” At the time, insiders thought so too. All of us were right. Broadstone’s doing a lot that we can like. It looks like it’s handling the bankruptcies of tenants At Home and Claire’s in stride. Management expects that its burgeoning build-to-suit pipeline will reach its $500 million end-of-year goal. But it’d be nice to see BNL share the wealth. The company recently updated its full-year guidance for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), expecting $1.48 to $1.50 per share. It’s on track to pay $1.16. BNL could easily boost its dividend. Management just hasn’t shared the wealth yet. Global Net Lease (GNL, 9.4% dividend yield) is another commercial net-lease operator, and it has a significant international bent. GNL’s 911-property portfolio spans 10 countries. North American operations (U.S. and Canada) account for 70% of straight-line rents; eight European companies account for the remaining 30%. The average remaining lease term isn’t as long as Broadstone’s, at just over six years, but it does utilize rent escalators, which are on 88% of leases. Global Net Lease has also been busy trying to improve its operations. It recently completed the $1.8 billion sale of its multitenant retail portfolio, which improved overall occupancy and improved its annualized net operating income (NOI) margin. It has been buying back stock. And it has been rapidly deleveraging—GNL has shed $2 billion in net debt in roughly a year. During the company’s most recent earnings call, CEO Michael Weil noted that “S&P Global upgraded our corporate credit rating to BB+ from BB and raised our issuer level rating on our unsecured notes to investment-grade BBB- from BB+.” The stock has been doing exactly what we’d expect in the midst of that kind of turnaround, beating the pants off the real estate sector year-to-date. GNL’s past payout cuts weren’t by choice—they were survival. Dividend coverage looks fine today, but only if cash flow keeps climbing. A couple “hybrid” REITs—Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH, 7.7% dividend yield) and Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN, 13.3% dividend yield) are benefiting from a one-two punch: declining rates and return-to-office mandates. But both cut payouts this year and their balance sheets leave no margin for error: Armada Hoffler kicked off 2025 with weak guidance and a quick dividend cut. It’s still on pace for a significant drop in FFO, and its guidance hasn’t changed, but the most recent quarter saw at least a few green shoots, including a slight improvement in same-store cash NOI growth. Brandywine, while a hybrid REIT, is much heavier in office influence. BDN owns 63 properties representing ~11.8 million rentable square feet, and office space accounts for just less than 90% of each (56 properties representing ~10.4 million rentable square feet). Joint ventures have been Brandywine’s Achilles’ heel of late; some of its development deals force BDN to recognize numerous costs until the projects become profitable, and that has resulted in significant downward revisions to FFO estimates. Relief could be on the way, though, as several JVs could be recapitalized in coming quarters. Brandywine also secured a massive deal with Nvidia (NVDA), which will occupy nearly 100,000 square feet in BDN’s One Uptown development in Austin. But let’s keep a really close eye on the dividend. The payout was 107% of FFO through the first half of 2025, and full-year FFO are expected to just barely pay for the dividend. If Brandywine runs into liquidity issues, that 13%-plus yield could be a rug-pull just waiting to happen. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself? The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “ Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history. The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds. The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies. But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy. Perhaps the most instructive parallel for today’s AI boom lies in the massive infrastructure overinvestment that preceded the dot-com crash. Telecommunications companies laid more than 80 million miles of fiber optic cables across the U.S., driven by WorldCom’s wildly inflated claim that internet traffic was doubling every 100 days—far beyond the actual annual doubling rate. Companies like Global Crossing, Level 3, and Qwest raced to build massive networks to capture anticipated demand that never materialized. The result was catastrophic overcapacity. Even four years after the bubble burst, 85% to 95% of the fiber laid in the 1990s remained unused, earning the nickname “dark fiber.” Corning, the world’s largest optical-fiber producer, saw its stock crash from nearly $100 in 2000 to about $1 by 2002. Ciena’s revenue fell from $1.6 billion to $300 million almost overnight, with its stock plunging 98% from its peak. The parallels to today’s AI infrastructure buildout are unmistakable. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans this year for an AI data center “so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan”. The Stargate Project, backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, aims to develop a $500 billion nationwide network of AI data centers. Yet, crucial differences exist. Unlike many dot-com companies that had no revenue, major AI players are generating substantial income. Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, heavily focused on AI, grew 39% year-over-year to an $86 billion run rate. OpenAI projects $20 billion in annualized revenue by the end of the year, according to The Information, up from around $6 billion at the start of the year. The dot-com crash ultimately came down to a harsh reality: Most internet companies couldn’t justify their valuations with actual business results. Companies were valued based on website traffic and growth metrics rather than traditional measures like cash flow and profitability. Today’s AI companies face a similar test. While AI investment has reached historic levels, the revenue gap remains substantial. According to tech writer Ed Zitron, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google will have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years, but have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue combined. A recent MIT study found that 95% of AI pilot projects fail to yield meaningful results, despite more than $40 billion in generative AI investment. This disconnect between investment and returns echoes the fundamental problem that ultimately doomed the dot-com bubble. The question facing investors today isn’t whether AI will transform the economy—most experts agree it will. The question is whether current valuations and infrastructure investments can be justified by near-term returns, or whether, like the fiber-optic cables of the 1990s, much of today’s AI infrastructure will sit unused while the market awaits demand to catch up with supply. As history shows, even transformative technologies can’t escape the gravitational pull of economics—so while the internet did change the world, it didn’t happen as quickly as some of its early champions promised, and several of those people who got ahead of themselves were humbled in the process.

Title: Amazon’s fall hardware event: 5 Echo devices overdue for an upgrade

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. After skipping last year, Amazon is back with a big fall hardware event slated for next week, and we’re expecting plenty of new Echo smart speakers and displays that make the most of Alexa+, Amazon’s AI revamp of the Alexa voice assistant. Plenty of other hardware will also be unwrapped during Amazon’s September 30 event in New York City; for example, we’re sure to see new Kindle tablets, as well as Fire TV models and perhaps even some Ring cameras. For now, though, we’re concentrating on new Echo devices, and there are a few popular Echo speakers and displays that are ripe for an upgrade. We’re most interested in how the latest Echo hardware will take full advantage of Alexa+, the generative AI-enhanced Alexa that can carry on flowing conversations, take actions on your behalf, and control smart home devices based on natural-language commands. (It’s worth noting that most existing Echo speakers and displays already are compatible with Alexa+, so there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you don’t want to.) There haven’t been many leaks or rumors about specific new Echo devices we might see next week. That said, we do have a bead on some older but nonetheless popular Echo speakers and displays that are in dire need of a refresh. What is it: Amazon’s flagship Echo speaker that doubles as a smart home hub Latest release: 2020 (fourth generation) List price: $99.99 Don’t miss our hands-on impressions of the all-new Echo and Echo Show lineup. Michael Brown/Foundry It’s been nearly five years since Amazon released a new version of its top-of-the-line Echo, making it the oldest speaker in Amazon’s current Echo lineup. It’s high time for a new one. A larger version of the popular and inexpensive Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo shares many of the Dot’s features, including motion detection, a temperature sensor, and the ability to extend the range of Amazon’s line of Eero mesh Wi-Fi routers. The Echo also houses stereo tweeters and a three-inch woofer, making for a nice upgrade to the Echo Dot’s so-so audio performance. But the Echo has an ace up its sleeve: a full-on Zigbee home hub, capable of directly controlling Zigbee lights, sensors, switches, and other Zigbee-enabled devices. The Echo also packs a Thread radio, allowing it to act as a Thread border router. Plunk an Echo in your living room, and you have everything you need to launch your smart home—well, aside from a Z-Wave radio, which would be a cool feature for an updated Echo. (We’re not holding on breath on that one, as Z-Wave is not embraced by the Matter standard.) An all-new Echo would seem like a no-brainer for Amazon’s hardware event next week, complete with beefier hardware for smoother Alexa+ performance and perhaps even a physical makeover. What it is: Amazon’s budget-priced Echo workhorse Latest release: 2022 (fifth generation) List price: $49.99 Ben Patterson/Foundry If the Echo is Amazon’s flagship smart speaker, the Echo Dot is its smaller sibling, shedding the Zigbee smart hub but keeping the motion and temperature sensors as well as the Eero mesh extender functionality. Priced at $50 but often on sale for much less, the Echo Dot is a smart choice for putting Alexa in every room, what with its handsome design and good-enough audio performance. There are now cheaper Echos in Amazon’s lineup—see the $40 Echo Pop from 2023—but the Echo Dot hits the sweet spot in terms of price and performance. Now that it’s due to celebrate its third birthday, the Echo Dot is primed for a new Alexa+-enhanced version. I could see it sharing the same overall design as the new Echo—smaller form factor, of course—with a modest audio upgrade and even a Thread border router functionality, which would allow the Dot to act as a hub for Matter devices. What it is: A premium Echo speaker that does Dolby Atmos Latest release: 2023 (second generation) List price: $199.99 (no longer available) Amazon If you want an Amazon Echo speaker that can truly put on a sonic show, the Dolby Atmos-enabled Echo Studio is the obvious choice—if you can find one, that is. The second-generation Echo Studio has been out of stock for months now, making it a prime candidate for a makeover. Packing three two-inch mid-range speakers, a 20mm tweeter, and a 5.25-inch woofer, the Echo Studio has all the drivers its needs to belt out audiophile-quality sound. The Echo Studio isn’t just a great music speaker, though. Like the Echo, it offers a Zigbee home hub and a Matter hub. An upgraded version of the Studio with Alexa+ playing DJ could be a highlight of Amazon’s hardware event next week. What it is: An Echo display with a pivoting screen that follows you around the room Latest release: 2021 (third generation) List price: $249.99 (no longer available) Michael Brown/Foundry Hard to believe, but it’s been four years since the Echo Show 10 made its debut, and boy was it a showstopper. Yes, the Echo Show 10 boasts such smart home features as a Zigbee hub and a Thread border router (the unit’s Matter-over-Thread abilities were enabled after launch), 2.1-channel audio, a 13-megapixel camera, and an impressive 10-inch screen. But its killer feature was its swiveling display, which could follow you as you strolled around the room. That rotating display made the Echo Show 10 feel like the most aware Echo device yet, so just imagine how that would play with Alexa+ on board, looking out into your kitchen and making suggestions as you prepare a gourmet meal. Sure, Alexa+ can already work on the existing third-gen Echo Show 10, but we’re eager to see a new take on that motorized design. As with the Echo Studio, the Echo Show 10 has been unavailable via Amazon for some time, leading us to believe that a fourth generation of the display is imminent. What is it: Amazon’s Alexa-powered smart glasses Latest release: 2023 (third generation) List price: Varies depending upon style Ben Patterson/Foundry With the likes of Meta’s camera-enabled AI glasses on the scene, Amazon’s audio-only Echo Frames are looking decidedly old hat these days. First announced back in 2019, the Echo Frames came with a handsome design and mini speakers and microphones in the temples that promised to put Alexa in your head. The most recent release from 2023 offered updated looks and plenty of audio refinements, and the Frames are now compatible with Alexa+. Still, the basic conceit and limitations remain: it’s Alexa (or Alexa+) in your head, and only in your head. Meta, meanwhile, has supercharged the market for smart glasses that allow an AI companion to see the world around you, offering commentary and insights wherever you go (even if the results are a tad uneven). Will Amazon take the fight to Meta with vision-enabled Echo Frames with Alexa+? It’s a bit of a long shot, but I’m not ruling it out.

Title: Is the Big Business of AI Dominated by Too Few Big Businesses?

U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies. Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with "Customer A" representing 23% of sales and "Customer B" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales. But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies. Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers. “Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.” The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth. Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years. Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said. Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration. Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI. The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT. “These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.” Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications. Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post / Getty Images Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises. “It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back.

Title: Why is everyone buying groceries in bulk? BI's Steve Russolillo unpacks Costco's chokehold on America.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. This week, Amazon settled with the FTC for $2.5 billion following an exclusive Business Insider investigation into the e-commerce company's misleading Prime sign-up and cancellation tactics. Also, BI's new markets newsletter is coming to inboxes soon. Sign up for First Trade here! On the agenda today: But first: Where do you store all of those groceries? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. I've got a confession: I don't get what all the fuss is about Costco. Gigantic bags of potato chips, enough ketchup to last until the end of the decade, endless rolls of toilet paper (well, maybe post-COVID I get that one). But seriously, why does anyone need a 20-pound tub of margarine? A colleague (who may or may not be the lead weekday writer of this newsletter) wants to buy a second refrigerator for his garage just so he can store even more stuff from Costco. "The biggest pain point in my marriage is probably Costco," BI's Dan DeFrancesco told me. "Before every trip, my wife warns me not to get carried away. And then I proceed to get carried away and buy 18 pounds of chicken breasts." Look, I get it. Buying in bulk is very much en vogue these days. Just look at Costco's earnings report the other day. Sales and profit are up. Total paid memberships are rising. More people are finding the experience so compelling that they're upgrading their memberships. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said opening early for executive members boosted weekly sales by 1%. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai indicates the adjusted hours are helping the company accomplish several key goals, namely getting shoppers to visit more quickly and more often. Costco is also set to open new locations faster than usual, particularly in areas with popular stores. The goal is to relieve some of the traffic pressure in those locations, creating a better shopping experience. People talk about Costco the way some talk about religion. It's an experience, a pilgrimage if you will, for hot deals and free samples. You can get everything from ever-pricey gold bars to the ultimate inflation-proof offering: the vaunted $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. Maybe I'm just a city snob who doesn't get all the finer things in life that Costco has to offer. I'll stick with Trader Joe's and my corner bodega. What are your thoughts on Costco and the early hours for executive members? We'd love to hear from you. Please email me at srussolillo@insider.com. Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal. Taylor Swift and Kanye West. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Having a workplace enemy isn't always the most pleasant experience, but battling them can actually push you to grow and further your career. That's because a work nemesis is often a competitor for a boss' praise or promotion. Competition can be a driver of peak performance — as long as it stays healthy. Who's your office opp? Startup founders and their employees were thrown into a frenzy after President Donald Trump announced his new $100,000 H-1B visa fee. Some young companies have frozen hiring as they wait for more clarity. While the Big Tech companies are by far the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program, the proposed changes will have an outsized impact on smaller startups, according to 10 founders and investors BI spoke with. "Is there another shoe about to drop?" Also read: The company recently announced another round of corporate layoffs and an array of store closures across North America. It's part of CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" initiative, and takes a page out of his Chipotle turnaround strategy. At Chipotle, Niccol revitalized the chain's brand after a 2015 E. coli scandal. The coffee giant is a much bigger beast, though — and his efforts haven't paid off yet. A huge undertaking. Also read: While an exceptionally tight job market has made job seekers increasingly desperate, the rise of cheap generative AI tools has allowed scammers to get more sophisticated. Scammers are deceiving even well-educated job seekers of any age by using LinkedIn as a launchpad for their crimes. Two people who lost thousands of dollars to these scams shared their stories with BI. An #OpenToWork nightmare. This week's quote: "My friends say my homes look like serial killer homes. I like it to look like nobody lives there ever. I need you to walk into my house and be like, 'Is this a staged home?'" — Nectir cofounder Kavitta Ghai on how she likes her apartment to be set up. The Netherlands is the second-biggest agricultural exporter The country is only the size of Maryland, but its research hub, Wageningen University and Research, has created a global model for farming. Here's how the Dutch are adjusting to a swath of crises plaguing the industry. More of this week's top reads: I went from MTV star to managing fortunes at Bank of America.

Reviews ethics statement This is your complete guide to all the Alexa voice commands that make managing your smart home easier than ever. These voice commands can help you unlock Alexa's true potential. If you still think Alexa is just for setting timers and playing music, it's time to catch up. After 11 years, Amazon finally gave its voice assistant a massive brain upgrade with the new, AI-powered Alexa Plus, and it's a total game-changer. This isn't the same Alexa you're used to. The new version is smarter, more conversational, and can actually anticipate your needs. We're talking about an assistant that can manage your entire smart home, juggle your calendar, and follow you from room to room. While privacy is still a valid concern for many, a recent CNET survey found Alexa is the most trusted AI assistant out there. Your Echo device is now capable of so much more, but it's useless if you don't know what to say. Here are the essential Alexa commands you need to know to unlock what your smart speaker can actually do now. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response.

Title: Big Tech’s hunger for energy draws private equity to utilities
URL: https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/big-techs-hunger-for-energy-draws-private-equity-to-utilities-214057

Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9 percent stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share . Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. big tech, Ukraine said on Tuesday that a Russian overnight drone strike had killed a family of four in the northeastern Sumy region. Türkiye has emerged as the world’s 14th largest market for industrial robots, with adoption expanding rapidly across sectors such as automotive and defense. Türkiye's national men's basketball team returned home on Monday to a rapturous welcome at Istanbul Airport following their silver medal finish at EuroBasket 2025, where they fell just short of the title in a thrilling final against Germany.

Title: Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. Economists say that’s a bright red flag | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-09-28T09:09:54Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. But while the market’s climb may be inflating their accounts, they are more exposed than ever to a potential market slump. Direct and indirect stock holdings, including in mutual funds or retirement plans, accounted for an all-time high of 45% of households’ financial assets in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve data. The record-high stock ownership raises red flags about whether a market downturn could hit Americans’ personal finances — especially in an economy with an increasingly fragile labor market and stubborn inflation. The milestone is a product of multiple factors: stocks have hit record highs, boosting the value of holdings; more Americans are directly participating in the stock market; and retirement plans like 401(k)s that invest in the stock market have risen in popularity in recent decades. Record-high stocks are generally good — that lets more people benefit from Corporate America’s gains, especially long-term investors. But it’s not all upside. Because so many people now own and have so much of their money in stocks, the market has more influence on the economy, for good or ill, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “The impact of a stock market melt-up or a meltdown — it goes both ways — is going to be much more impactful across the economy than, say, just a decade ago,” Roach said. Notably, Americans’ stock ownership has surpassed that of the late 1990s, just before dot-com bubble burst, said John Higgins, chief markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins said in a note to clients. “Indeed, our forecast is that the S&P 500 will make further gains this year and next,” Higgins added. “But the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.” The S&P 500 has rallied 33% since hitting a low point on April 8. The benchmark index is up 13% since January 1 and has notched 28 record highs this year. The AI boom has fueled the market rally this year. Big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have surged, lifting major indexes like the S&P 500, which are weighted by companies’ market value. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks — including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500’s gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Investors are benefiting, but as the S&P 500 becomes increasingly concentrated — the Mag Seven account for 34% of the S&P’s market value — they remain exposed to the fate of a few enormous companies. AI and tech stocks slide as summer rally peters out It’s not just American households that are holding record levels of stocks. Foreign investors’ share of US stocks also hit a record high in the second quarter, according to Fed data. History shows that when levels of stock ownership are at record highs, the risk of a downturn and the potential for below-average returns increases, according to Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research. “Investors shouldn’t expect the same magnitude of returns that we’ve seen during the last decade to repeat,” Anderson said. “Going forward, over the next 10 years, there’s probably going to be a downshift in returns.” While the S&P 500 floats near record highs, concerns are also mounting about the emergence of a “K-shaped economy,” in which the richest Americans get even richer while the poorest Americans continue to struggle or get even poorer. That’s in part because the job market, where most Americans make the bulk of their money, is stagnating, while the stock market, which is how wealthy people tend to make their money, is surging. “Those who have a high degree of wealth in the stock market feel like they’re doing extraordinarily well,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. “Those who don’t, who are largely tied to employment as their primary asset, feel much more constrained in today’s society.” That is creating distortions in economic data, too, helping to paint a rosier overall picture than the one many Americans are feeling in their lives. The buoyant stock market is propping up the net worth of the wealthy, fueling their own spending, which in turn has helped propel economic growth, Roach at LPL Financial said. The data reflect that dichotomy: The top 10% of earners (earning more than $353,000 annually) accounted for more than 49% of consumer spending in the second quarter, the highest share on record going back to 1989, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. But underneath the hood, the economy is on shakier grounds: Lower-income Americans are increasingly strained, and if there is a market slump, it could spook the wealthy Americans who have been propping up the economy with their spending. The Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans “The stock market becomes a bigger economic driver when you’ve got that much exposure,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Gordon said while the market’s gains can spur consumer spending, the opposite can be true when the market tumbles. “There is a bigger risk that to the extent you get a protracted downturn in the market, that starts to weigh on household spending, and starts to weigh on the psychology in particular of people up the wealth spectrum,” Gordon said.

Title: Get used to an America with fewer jobs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-trump-immigration-policies-affecting-job-market-h1b-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-28T08:09:02Z
Full Content:
We're learning what America looks like with fewer immigrants and fewer jobs. The Trump administration has been cracking down on immigration over the past few months, ramping up deportations and travel bans. It recently announced a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa program applicants, which could affect some major companies, like Amazon, that leverage the program. Immigration policies could be exacerbating the defining feature of the frozen 2025 labor market: Workers haven't faced mass layoffs, but hiring has slowed to a crawl. A more slowly-growing labor force with lower levels of immigration will likely see a much lower level of job growth, but weak labor demand with weak supply means that unemployment may not spike. And even native-born workers have not yet seen a major boon to employment in that continuing slow market. Dante DeAntonio, labor economist at Moody's Analytics, said there's "no doubt" immigration policy changes are affecting the job market. "There was a clear downshift in labor force growth starting in the second half of 2024, and the labor force has flatlined so far in 2025," DeAntonio said. "The most immediate impact of this change is a likely shortage of available labor, particularly in industries that are more heavily reliant on foreign-born labor, such as agriculture, construction, and leisure/hospitality." Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said President Donald Trump aims to grow the US economy and add job opportunities for Americans. "There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws," Jackson said. "The Trump Administration is focused on protecting the American workforce, ending instances of labor exploitation or trafficking, and working with American employers to ensure they have the legal workforce they need to be successful." Below are some of the ways immigration has affected the job market. Declining immigration means a more slowly growing workforce, which could make this summer's disappointingly low job growth a new normal. One measure used to assess the labor market's performance is the breakeven rate, or how much job growth is needed to keep unemployment steady as the labor force adds more new entrants from immigration and young people aging into their working years. A more slowly-growing workforce from lower levels of immigration would make that breakeven rate drop, and that could lead to lower job growth in the long run. We won't know the full extent of how the likely decline in immigration has affected population growth for a while, so estimates for how many jobs the US needs to add each month to keep unemployment stable in the long run could vary widely. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider that if net immigration is zero, it would mean a breakeven rate close to August's job growth. However, he cautioned that we don't yet know the full extent of the immigration slowdown. A blog post from Kolko showed that the breakeven rate in early 2024 was much higher. Other estimates for that breakeven rate are higher. A Morgan Stanley note in early September said that 70,000 jobs added a month by the end of the year is probably consistent with flat unemployment. That would mean recent growth is too low. On the other end of the spectrum, David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider the payroll growth needed to keep unemployment constant could be around zero. "You've got very weak growth at this stage in the economy because we've got really no increase in the number of people available to work," Kelly said. Immigration changes don't necessarily mean a better job market for non-immigrant job seekers. The native-born unemployment rate has ticked up from January's rate. "Some people expected that a slowdown in immigration would open up jobs for native-born workers," Kolko said. People are having a hard time getting a job because companies aren't so eager to hire or lay people off as they deal with economic uncertainty. "Sending immigrant workers away is not going to insulate workers from the labor market impact of tariffs or a recession," said Chris Martin, the lead researcher at company-review and job-search platform Glassdoor. Pay is one reason DeAntonio thinks immigration changes would take a while to see a positive effect on non-immigrant job seekers. He said that "non-immigrant labor is not a perfect substitute for immigrant labor because the types of jobs and occupations filled by immigrant labor are lower paying, on average, and many non-immigrants are unlikely to fill those positions unless pay rises substantially." The recent H-1B changes could mean employers look to offshore work or check out other visas. "We will likely push to get employees O-1 visas instead now," one startup founder told Business Insider. A 2023 paper from Britta Glennon, an assistant professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, found that US multinational companies that encounter H-1B visa restrictions tend to ramp up hiring in other countries, especially in China, India, and Canada. Glennon told Business Insider that multinational companies are probably going to ramp up offshore strategies unless they really need talent in the US. "If they're intensifying the offshoring, that's more jobs and investment going abroad, rather than the US," Glennon told Business Insider, adding that such a development would run counter to the intent of the policy changes to visa programs like H-1B. She added that not all employers, including startups and universities, have the resources or option to offshore. Some sectors that rely more on immigration are not growing much. Construction employment has plateaued, for instance. "Immigration policies are definitely impacting labor supply by both pushing out immigrant workers and slowing applications to work in the US," said Martin. "It's too early to know just how many, but we are likely talking hundreds of thousands fewer workers." Kolko said in a recent analysis that employment growth has been flat in construction, home healthcare, and other industries that are more reliant on unauthorized-immigrant labor, with a three-month annualized increase of just 0.06% in August. Other private sectors together had an increase of 0.34%, which is cooler than the 2.2% at the start of the year, as the job market has softened. Tim Paradis contributed to this story. Jump to

Title: ‘Regrets over delay’ – Vanguard to offer crypto ETFs to 50M investors

Client FOMO has forced Vanguard to rethink crypto ETF ban Client demand for crypto ETF access reportedly drove the shift, forcing Vanguard to adapt and open its brokerage platform to third-party products. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Balchunas, it will be positive for the sector. Vanguard, a $10 trillion asset manager, is reportedly planning to offer access to crypto ETFs after distancing itself from the industry since 2024. According to a former Fox Business reporter, Eleanor Terret, the firm is planning to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. The world’s largest mutual fund and second-biggest asset manager will enable access through its brokerage platform. Gerald Gallagher, General Counsel at Sei Labs, confirmed the Vanguard plans, citing a senior insider familiar with the issue. He added that the asset manager had “regrets” and wished they had done it “sooner.” Gallagher noted that the firm will not do original crypto ETF issuance but will offer access to third-party providers due to client demand. By contrast, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the pivot was expected. He previously predicted that the new Vanguard CEO, Salim Ramji, who spearheaded BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF, would accept crypto. He added that it was “smart of them” to end the Bitcoin ETF ban. “Smart of them imo. Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs hugely popular, and Salim (the CEO) was one of IBIT’s midwives, so he knows.” Source: X As of September, BlackRock crypto holdings were worth about $100 billion. Its Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), had over $85B worth of assets at current market prices. Overall, the world’s largest asset manager was earning about $250 million in revenue from its crypto section, surpassing its equity business line. Source: X Fidelity was the second-largest crypto ETF player, with about $25 billion in net crypto assets under management. That being said, the details on Vanguard crypto ETF plans will be known in the near future. But the impact will be positive for the market, added Balchunas. “Vanguard has 50 million investors. Obviously, many are not the bitcoin type, but that’s massive; they are the biggest fund company in the US by two times over.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Sen. Dick Durbin, Months from Retirement, Becomes First Democrat to Criticize H-1B Visa Program
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/09/27/democrats-begin-to-criticize-h-1b-program-amid-mass-firing-of-americans/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T21:47:14Z

A bipartisan pair of Senators is asking 10 major CEOs to explain why they are hiring Indian and Chinese H-1B migrants while they are also firing skilled American professionals. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions allocated by the H-1B lottery program,” said the September 25 letter signed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL). “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years… At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in the letters. Grassley chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee. Durbin is the top Democrat on the committee and one of the most pro-migration Democrats in Congress. The H-1B issue is becoming toxic for companies as federal data shows rising unemployment among young American graduates. “The Overton Window has shifted,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, which lobbies against the visa programs. He added: In any other year, we would be fighting bad legislation. Now we’re seeing good legislation being introduced… Trump has come a long way from December [when he backed the H-1B program]… On November 10, we’ll have a bunch of tech workers walking around Capitol Hill, speaking to legislative staff, telling what has happened to them… Yeah, we have a lot of momentum. One letter was sent to the CEOs of Amazon, which is the biggest user of H-1B workers. Similar letters were also sent to the CEOs of Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JP Morgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy, and Walmart, which recently faced claims that an Indian executive sold a subcontract to an Indian-run H-1B firm in exchange for kickbacks. The letter asks for responses by October. Some other Democratic-aligned leaders are speaking against the program that keeps roughly 1.2 million foreign workers in the white-collar jobs that are needed by young American couples. “I’ve worked on H-1B politics for 30 years,” said a September 21 X post from Democratic-aligned investor Reed Hastings. “Trump’s $100k per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H-1B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs.” “Once in a great while, our Dear Leader does something half-right,” wrote the far-left editor of The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner: [For example] the H-1B visa program, where Trump abruptly imposed a visa fee of $100,000 per imported worker. The program, on the whole, is a travesty. It’s a modern version of international indentured servitude. Trump’s action was impulsive, weird, and theatrically disruptive rather than reformist. He didn’t say whether it was a one-time or annual fee, and reportedly he hasn’t even figured that out yet. Nonetheless, we’ll take it. “In the case of the H-1B fee, he stumbled into a useful if impulsive action. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day,” said Kuttner’s September 26 comment. Some advocates for businesses are also giving a little ground in the hope that Congress will provide more migrants for tech companies. For example, Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, told Newsweek: Neufeld said it was widely understood that the H-1B has been used to undercut American wages, and that he was hopeful Congress could finally act — at the very least to reform the lottery selection process. “Which is, I think, widely understood to be basically insane that we are deciding who is going to be part of Team America and help drive our economic fortunes by random chance,” he told Newsweek. “We wouldn’t pick our Olympic team by random chance. Why are we picking our high school immigrants this way?” Neufeld’s group is supported by investor-funded foundations. The editorial board at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post is defending the counterproductive program, but also endorses some tinkering: Sen. Jim Banks (R-Indiana), for instance, recently introduced a bill that would similarly raise wage requirements for H-1B holders and replace the visa lottery with a bidding system. Does Trump want a quick win that disappears after he leaves office — or a more comprehensive reform that will last for years to come? Still, pro-migration groups do not want to give any significant concessions to mainstream American voters. For example, Indian immigrant Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) denounced Trump’s modest curbs on the outsourcing program. Trump’s new $100k fee for H-1B visa recipients will completely upend research taking place in WA and across this country. This is bad for our hospitals, our economy, our communities — full stop. But investor groups just want more migrants, “The simplest fix would be to simply raise the annual [H-1B] cap, as Congress did temporarily in the early 2000s,” says a January report by FWD.us, a lobby group for Silicon Valley investors, adding: Congress could exempt priority immigrants, like advanced degree graduates from U.S. schools, from the caps so they do not have to go through the lottery. (Similar exemptions are already in place for employees of nonprofit and government research institutions.) Congress should also create alternative pathways targeted specifically at recruiting and retaining graduates and STEM experts, thereby moving them out of the H-1B process. This should include a true post-graduation work visa option for international students to begin their careers in the U.S., separate from training programs like OPT, as well as a dedicated green card option on the basis of a U.S. education. Similar visa options should be established for STEM experts seeking to work in industries critical to national security and global competitiveness, and for entrepreneurs ready to launch new companies and create jobs in the U.S. Investors gain from migration because the arrival of more consumers, renters, and workers generates more business activity, regardless of damage to productivity, innovation, wage levels, crime, or Americans’ ability to form and raise families. “The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” said a September 19 proclamation by Trump establishing modest curbs on the H-1B program: The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa. … The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States.

Title: Analyst Predicts Solana Staking ETFs To Be Approved For Trading Within Two Weeks — Is $300 SOL Next Stop?

Multiple applications for Solana (SOL) staking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are poised to secure the regulatory nod from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the coming weeks. In a recent post on the X social media platform, Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth Management, pointed out that on Friday, asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale Investments, VanEck, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and Fidelity, all submitted revised S-1 registration statements for their spot SOL ETFs to the SEC to clarify details around their staking activity. Fidelity, which manages the second-largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by assets under management, will stake a portion of its SOL holdings to generate yield, according to its updated filing. According to Geraci, this flurry of SOL applications, which include a staking component, is likely to receive US approval by mid-October. “Guessing these are approved w/in next two weeks,” he stated. The ETF analyst further suggested that the inclusion of staking in the SOL filings “bodes well for spot ETH staking.” Notably, BlackRock, which is the undisputed leader of the U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has not yet submitted paperwork to list its own spot SOL fund. REX Shares and Osprey launched the first-ever Solana staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange in July after securing automatic approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SOL fund attracted $12 million worth of investments in its Wall Street debut and currently boasts assets under management of around $301 million, signaling considerable demand for Solana ETFs. Additionally, Hashdex recently added Solana, Cardano, and Ripple’s XRP to its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, alongside the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) it already held. The regulator also greenlighted a similar multi-crypto fund from Grayscale, giving investors exposure to several assets, including SOL. Solana was trading hands at around $201.61 as of press time, largely flat over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token’s price has fallen 31.2% since hitting its current all-time high of $293.31 in January, not long after the historic introduction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s SOL-based meme coin. With the US SEC approval almost certain, SOL’s path to the coveted $300 milestone heavily relies on capturing significant ETF inflows and maintaining steady accumulation from Solana treasury firms.

BTC$113,639.86 just ended what is historically the largest cryptocurrency's third-worst week of the year with a greater-than-average drop of 5%. Week 38 effectively closes out the third quarter, which is up about 1%, as well as September, which has managed to hold flat. While the figures are consistent with the period's historical reputation as one of the weakest seasons of the year, a few catalysts might have contributed to the underperformance. On Friday, more than $17 billion in options expired, with the max pain price — the strike price at which option holders lose the most money and options writers profit the most — sitting at $110,000, which acted as a gravitational center for the spot price. A key technical factor remains the short-term holder cost basis at $110,775, which reflects the average on-chain acquisition price for coins that moved in the past six months. Bitcoin tested this level in August, and in bull markets, it typically moves toward this line multiple times. This year, it broke significantly below that level only once: during the tariff tantrum in April, when it dropped to as low as $74,500. Zooming out, it is important to assess whether bitcoin remains in an uptrend characterized by higher highs and higher lows to get an idea of whether the rally is sustainable. Analyst Caleb Franzen highlights that bitcoin has slipped below its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), with the 200-day EMA sitting at $106,186. The previous significant low was around $107,252 on Sept. 1, and for the broader trend to remain intact, bitcoin will need to hold above that level., The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter, well above the 3.3% estimate and the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2023. Initial jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 218,000, coming in below expectations and marking the lowest level since mid-July. While spending data came in line with the market's expectation. The US core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation that excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in August 2025 from the prior month. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries bounced off the 4% support, and is now trading near 4.2%. The dollar index (DXY) continues to hover around long-term support at 98. Meanwhile, metals are leading the action, with silver at around $45 approaching an all-time high at levels last seen in 1980 and 2011. U.S. equities, in the meantime, are just shy of their records. Bitcoin remains the outlier at more than 10% below its peak. Bitcoin treasury companies continue to face severe multiple-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) compression. Strategy (MSTR) is barely positive year-to-date. At one point, it dipped below $300, a negative return for 2025. The ratio between Strategy and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stands at 4.8, the lowest since October 2024, which shows just how much the largest bitcoin treasury company has underperformed bitcoin over the past 12 months. Strategy’s enterprise mNAV is currently 1.44 (as of Friday). Enterprise value here accounts for all basic shares outstanding, total notional debt and total notional value of perpetual preferred stock minus the company’s cash balance. The silver lining for MSTR is that three of the four perpetual preferred stocks, STRK, STRC and STRF, are all sporting positive lifetime returns as Executive Chairman Michael Saylor looks to buy more BTC through these vehicles. A growing issue for MSTR is the lack of volatility in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's Implied volatility — a measure of the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations — has dropped below 40, the lowest in years. This matters because Saylor has often framed MSTR as a volatility play on bitcoin. For comparison, MSTR’s implied volatility is at 68. Its annualized standard deviation of daily log returns over the past year was 89%, while over the last 30 days it has fallen to 49%. For equities, higher volatility often attracts speculators, generates trading opportunities and draws investor attention, so the decline is likely acting as a headwind. Meantime, the fifth-largest bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet (3350), holds 25,555 BTC and still has roughly $500 million left to deploy from its international offering. Despite this, its share price continues to struggle at 517 yen ($3.45), more than 70% below its all-time high. Metaplanet’s mNAV has dropped to 1.12, down sharply from 8.44 in June. Its market capitalization now stands at $3.94 billion compared to a bitcoin NAV of $2.9 billion, with an average BTC acquisition cost of $106,065.

Title: Crypto’s Quiet Mainstreaming This Year

ByAlex Lazarow, Senior Contributor. For years, the crypto headlines have vacillated between hype (coin X is breaking out!) and gloom (but limited real-world adoption is nil). Quietly, the industry has migrated from speculation, into becoming the real plumbing of global finance. In this piece, I wanted to highlight three key developments that are harbingers of change to come. BlackRock already has a tokenized U.S. treasury vehicle with over $1b in assets. This makes it the largest tokenized firm of its kind. But to me, that’s not the big news. Blackrock is reportedly looking to tokenize its ETFs. This would change how ETFs are traded. It would allow them to be traded 24/7 – and represent an explosion in relevant assets. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was blunt: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing.” Robinhood is making similar moves, launching both tokenized versions of stocks and ETFs over the summer. Interestingly, it includes those of private companies like OpenAI or SpaceX. The market for tokenized assets already grew 85% last year to $15 billion (excluding stablecoins). McKinsey estimates tokenized markets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The World Economic Forum projects tokenization could represent 10% of global GDP as soon as 2027. Tokenization is moving from fringe experimentation, into a likely mainstay of some of the world’s largest asset managers. Stablecoins represent more than $250 billion in value today. More than 500 million wallets now hold stablecoins, with emerging markets driving much of that growth. While in the past crypto wallets were for speculation, many use cases today are mainstay financial services across treasury, settlements, cross-border payments. For corporates, they enable instant settlement with transparency. For banks, they radically reduce counterparty risk. For investors, they provide stability in volatile markets. And for consumers in emerging markets, stablecoins offer a way to escape currency depreciation. In countries like Argentina, Nigeria, and Turkey, inflation and currency volatility erode savings. Apps like Dollar App are building on top of stablecoins to allow users to save and spend in US dollars. Fintechs And Central Banks Are Building Their Own Rails Making headlines of course are fintech players. For example, Stripe is incubating Tempo, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed for payments. Its design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Shopify, Revolut, Nubank, DoorDash, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Stripe has also spent over a billion dollars acquiring stablecoin infrastructure — including its $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge (Fintech Futures). Circle, Visa, and others are experimenting with proprietary blockchains to reduce costs and accelerate settlement. More quietly, but likely far more transformative are central bank actions. One hundred and thirty-seven countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are now exploring central bank digital currencies. Seventy-two are in advanced development or pilot stages. In Nigeria, the eNaira doubled to 10 million active users in 2024. In India, the e-rupee in circulation grew 334% in a year, exceeding $120 million by Q1 2025. As governments adopt digital money, banks, fintechs and corporates will likely follow. Whereas much of this innovation was once the viewed as fantasy, it is increasingly becoming mainstream. The U.S. passed the Genius act. Europe passed the MiCA framework for digital assets. But it has happened slowly and now seemingly all at once.

Title: Tech billionaire defends massive H-1B labor pipeline, warns Trump’s reforms will ‘backfire’

Time Published: 2025-09-27T16:40:26Z
Full Content:
By Amanda Bartolotta September 27, 2025 Michael Moritz, the billionaire venture capitalist and longtime Silicon Valley insider, published an opinion piece in the Financial Times attacking President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions. Moritz claimed the policy would damage America’s tech industry rather than protect U.S. workers. In a dramatic flourish, he likened the White House to The Sopranos, calling the fee a “caper” and accusing the administration of failing to understand “why the U.S., especially its technology sector, has worked so well.” This debate is about more than Moritz’s claims. It reveals how language can be used to reframe the issue, obscure accountability and pressure policymakers into surrendering leverage to global capital at America’s expense. Moritz is only the latest voice using familiar arguments that have long perpetuated harm to U.S. workers. The difference is that the facts, unlike opinions, can be tested, verified and held up against the record. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The blurred line between ‘skill shortage’ and ‘labor arbitrage’ Moritz argues that big tech “hires foreign nationals because they possess particular skills” and fill “areas where the U.S. has labor shortages.” But the so-called “skilled worker” narrative surrounding the H-1B visa is a total and provable myth. The H-1B program was originally pitched as a way for U.S. companies to bring in highly skilled workers when no qualified Americans could be found. But decades of evidence show that corporations use it not to fill rare gaps, but to import cheaper labor and displace U.S. professionals. Even the program’s mechanics point away from merit. The H-1B system allocates visas by random lottery, not by skill, wage level or national need. Instead, it’s the luck of the draw, not merit that wins out. The records that employers submit to the Department of Labor through the so-called PERM process tell a much different story. PERM (Permanent Labor Certification) is the only stage wherein employers are legally required to test the U.S. labor market before sponsoring a foreign national for permanent residency. If there truly were a skilled labor shortage, corporations would embrace that safeguard. Instead, they cleverly design myriad ways to avoid finding qualified Americans. Job ads are drafted with inflated requirements that few domestic candidates will meet. Notices are intentionally placed where they are unlikely to be seen. Ads are run only in the bare-minimum formats required by regulation. And after layoffs, companies like Google and Amazon simply pause PERM filings to avoid having to offer jobs back to the Americans they just terminated, a tactic openly advised by immigration attorneys. Moritz reinforces his point by listing “warehouse workers, account managers, brand specialists and dishwashers” as the kinds of jobs Americans hold. The effect is to suggest that only foreign workers fill demanding roles such as biochemists, software engineers and other high-skill positions, while Americans are concentrated in lower-level work. This framing makes U.S. layoffs and new H-1B requests appear unrelated, as if the Americans being cut were never in the same labor pool and therefore didn’t qualify for the legal notice requirement. Evidence from ongoing litigation shows otherwise. One company email cited 209 employees whose layoffs created a legal barrier to sponsoring foreign nationals in those same roles. Despite acknowledging the requirement to notify displaced Americans, the company treated them as an obstacle to be managed, rather than candidates to be rehired. This contrast with the H-1B program is critical. Unlike PERM, H-1B petitions do not require any recruitment or labor market test. Employers can file directly for foreign workers without demonstrating that no qualified Americans are available. The way companies work around the one safeguard that does exist indicates that qualified Americans are indeed available, but employers simply choose not to hire them. Impact of Layoffs on the PERM Process ‘Every bit as well qualified as their American counterparts’? Moritz’s claims that undergraduate degrees from Eastern Europe, Turkey or India are “every bit as well qualified” as American degrees do not stand up to global data. In the “QS World University Rankings 2026,” U.S. institutions dominate the top tier, with MIT ranked #1 for the 13th consecutive year and over 40 U.S. universities in the top 200. By contrast, India’s highest-ranked school, IIT Delhi, sits at 123rd and most Indian universities fall far lower. The Times Higher Education 2025 rankings show a similar pattern: The U.S. holds 7 of the top 10 universities worldwide, while India’s best performer, IISc Bangalore, is ranked in the 201-250 band, with the majority falling 600+ or unranked. Quality concerns are reflected in employability data. Studies show that of Indian engineering graduates, approximately 94% lack the skills required for employment, with only 4.77% able to complete a basic programming task. These findings contrast sharply with Moritz’s assertion and raise questions about the pipeline that supplies roughly three out of every four H-1B visas. Opinion doesn’t conceal facts: Documented cases of replacement Moritz insists that U.S. companies do not hire H-1B workers “to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons.” But documented cases prove otherwise. In 2015, Disney made headlines when IT employees were ordered to train H-1B replacements supplied by HCL. At Southern California Edison, hundreds of American IT roles were cut and replaced with H-1B contractors. The University of California required career staff to train incoming HCL hires. AT&T, after a $3 billion tax cut, expanded its outsourcing partnerships, displacing more than 16,000 Americans and closing 44 call centers. At Bank of America, the company acknowledged requiring U.S. employees to train foreign replacements, calling it “essential for knowledge transfer.” One employee, Kevin Flanagan, took his own life after being forced to train his foreign replacement, underscoring the human toll of these practices. These are just a few of many verifiable cases, not anecdotes. They demonstrate a pattern in which American workers are displaced while visa pipelines remain open and expanding. It’s all about cheap labor, not ‘rare skills’ Supporters often frame H-1B hiring as access to rare, high-end talent. But the government’s own data shows otherwise. Employers must classify H-1B jobs under one of four prevailing wage levels: Level 1 is “entry level,” while Level 4 reflects senior, fully competent roles. Employer records reveal that 83% of H-1B registrations fall into Levels I and II, both below the U.S. median wage. In computer and mathematical jobs, the single largest category, 271,000 of 315,000 filings, were placed at these lowest levels. Even in business and finance, nearly 80% landed at Levels I and II. Across the top five job categories, as little as 14% were classified at Levels III and IV. If the program were truly about filling rare shortages, employers would be filing at higher wage levels. Instead, filings cluster overwhelmingly at the bottom. The data shows that the H-1B program functions as a pipeline for lower-cost labor on a massive scale. India’s government confirms: H-1B fuels exports, not shortages In a Bloomberg article titled “India Seeks Access for Workers in US Trade Talks After H1B Blow”, Indian officials openly acknowledge the real function of the H-1B program. India Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told U.S. negotiators that the “mobility of skilled workers” is vital to India’s services exports. In plain terms, the H-1B program is not being used to solve America’s skill shortages; it is a pipeline that converts U.S. jobs into India’s export product. And the vehicle making this possible is not trade law, but America’s own immigration system. The report also shows that India views Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee not as an obstacle to filling U.S. skill shortages, but as a direct threat to its $280-billion tech services industry. For American workers, the consequences are twofold. First, jobs are lost at home when companies bring in lower-cost visa holders. Second, those same roles are exported overseas under the banner of “services,” turning U.S. employment into an international commodity. The hard truth: The H-1B program fails to protect Americans Moritz argues that U.S. law protects citizens from being replaced by H-1Bs. In reality, the program is structured in ways that leave Americans exposed. Employers are generally not required to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1Bs. Only a narrow subset of “H-1B-dependent” employers face additional rules, and those rules contain significant loopholes. Mst companies simply attest that they will not displace U.S. workers in the exact same job classification. Nothing prevents them from laying off staff in one unit while filling nearly identical roles with H-1Bs through outsourcing vendors. The Department of Labor’s Inspector General has reported widespread fraud and abuse in the program and found oversight grossly insufficient. The result is a system where violations are frequent, consequences rare and displacement, both direct and indirect, widespread. Veiled threats: The implied ultimatum Moritz warns that “advances in technology mean that it is less important for the tech companies to bring workers to America,” implying that if the U.S. restricts visas, companies will simply take the work abroad. Such statements raise questions about corporate loyalty to their country, America. With U.S. consumers generating the majority of revenue, the suggestion that jobs can simply be shifted elsewhere overlooks the role of American workers and taxpayers in building these companies. If firms choose to move operations overseas, policymakers could require repayment of subsidies, grants and tax breaks and retention of patents developed with U.S. funding. Policy makers should also implement new policies on offshoring and safeguarding American data from being transferred abroad, where privacy protections are weak or unenforceable. Narrative capture disguised as innovation Michael Moritz argues that the Trump administration should not shrink the H-1B program but instead double or triple visa numbers and automatically grant U.S. citizenship to foreign nationals earning PhDs in STEM fields from top American universities. He frames this as essential to keeping top talent from leaving for other countries. However, proposals of this kind would expand the supply of foreign labor, lock in employer access to it and make it more difficult for policymakers to reduce numbers later. Each step strengthens corporate reliance on foreign workers rather than on the domestic labor force. When Moritz and others call for increasing visa numbers under the banner of “economic fundamentals,” the result is an expanded supply of lower-cost labor for corporations. In this framework, “innovation” becomes linked less to investing in American workers and more to enlarging the pool of foreign labor that can be brought in. \ Moritz also points to his own immigration story as evidence that visa pipelines should be widened. Even after nearly 50 years in the United States and despite clear benefits from the American economy, his framing suggests that assimilation and citizenship are optional. In this view, American loyalty and sovereignty take a back seat to profit. Being American in America appears conditional, valued only so long as it aligns with higher financial returns. If greater profits can be found elsewhere, America itself is presented as interchangeable, or even for sale. Moritz’s op-ed frames resistance as xenophobic, backward or disconnected from “global realities,” while presenting the movement of jobs abroad as the natural fallback. Yet America’s strength has historically come from deliberate design, sovereignty and investment in its own workforce. The fortunes of the investor class were built on this foundation, even as current arguments push in the exact opposite direction. Moritz portrays his stance as safeguarding talent, but the emphasis aligns consistently with safeguarding financial returns. Restoring America’s promise The debate over H-1B visas is not about talent, progress or global competitiveness. It is about whether the United States will continue to sell out its workers, its sovereignty and its future for the short-term profits of the investor class. Michael Moritz’s arguments highlight a worldview where citizenship, assimilation and American loyalty are treated as optional and where the nation’s worth is reduced to margins on a balance sheet. The United States and its citizens were never meant to be interchangeable with others. The country was built on purpose, pride and sacrifice. Its strength has always come from investing in its own people, defending its sovereignty and ensuring that opportunity belongs first to the citizens who built and sustained it. If America is to secure the next century, policymakers must stop treating the displacement of American workers as collateral damage and start addressing it as the true national emergency it is. Immigration policy must serve the interests of American citizens, not the balance sheets of multinational corporations or the export ambitions of foreign governments. The choice is to stand with American workers or surrender the nation’s future. To keep the United States free, strong and sovereign, its leaders must protect American jobs, innovation and people – because America is not for sale.

Title: Are Whales and Institutional Players Still Bullish on Bitcoin? — Here’s What Market Data Says‬

Large investors and institutional players are quietly increasing their Bitcoin exposure, even as the broader market remains stagnant. New data from the Coinbase Premium Index reveals that the measure has remained positive since April, indicating that U.S. institutions and whale accounts on Coinbase Pro continue to purchase at a faster pace than retail traders elsewhere. The index, which tracks price differences between Coinbase and exchanges such as Binance, has long been seen as a barometer for institutional demand. The momentum is closely tied to the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Coinbase acts as both a custody and pricing partner for several of the funds, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, meaning ETF inflows are now directly reflected in this institutional premium. On-chain analyst Darkfost noted the trend on X, stressing that “whales and institutions are still accumulating BTC today.” He cautioned, however, that past cycles show how quickly sentiment can turn if euphoria builds unchecked. The Federal Reserve’s latest quarter-point rate cut appears to have sparked additional activity. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin open interest on Binance increased by 4.7% in the 24 hours following the decision, rising from $12.8 billion to $13.4 billion. Given Binance’s outsized share of global derivatives trading, analysts say the increase is a reliable signal of renewed appetite among high-volume traders. Many cryptocurrencies typically gain momentum during easing cycles since lower rates encourage risk-taking. The surge in open interest suggests that institutional traders are anticipating potential upside, complementing the steady accumulation already evident on Coinbase. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin commands a 57.1% share of the total cryptocurrency market, with an overall capitalization of $4.04 trillion at the time of writing. These figures are supported by a balanced market sentiment, even as whales expand their holdings. Whether that institutional support will be enough to push Bitcoin through resistance in the weeks ahead may depend less on short-term sentiment and more on how investors digest the Fed’s policy path.

Title: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries

Time Published: 2025-09-27T14:00:00Z

About us Copy link Digital asset treasuries have become crypto’s hottest trade, with over 200 companies now holding billions in tokens on their balance sheets. But investors are calculating the same metric called mNAV in such different ways that this has created a hall of mirrors where the same stock can look like a 90% discount or a 500% premium. The problem isn’t trivial since investors are making million-dollar-bets based on data that’s off by multiples. The article below written by pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains how to make sense of this complex metric and trade it accurately. mNAV is short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple. It tells you how much equity value you’re paying for every $1 of crypto the company holds. mNAV = Fully Diluted MarketCap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) We run it three ways: Realized: shares that exist today Realistic: realized plus in-the-money dilution (options, warrants, convertibles, RSUs) Maximum: everything that could possibly printAll three are often incorrectly used interchangeably by people when discussing “fully diluted” sharecounts, marketcaps, and mNAVs. In practice, doing so inevitably leads to miscommunication, disagreement, and, most consequentially, trades executed without full knowledge of what the true values actually are. The lens you pick to perceive through will change the picture in potentially radical ways. Realized can look like a discount. Maximum often will show the extreme or “worst-case” scenario of a premium. The HYPE DAT ecosystem is one of the clearest examples of why mNAV matters and how it gets misread, miscalculated, and, even, misreported. The three main HYPE treasury plays right now are: HYPD (Hyperion DeFi), SONN (soon to merge into Hyperliquid Strategies, HSI), and LGHL (Lion Group). Galaxy Digital (GLXY) also holds HYPE however because of its broader business mix, it’s been left out deliberately as it is not a pure DAT-focused trade. Depending on which share count you use to calculate for marketcaps, these stocks can look like deep discounts or expensive premiums. One investor will say SONN is 0.06x. Another will say it’s 5.27x. Both are technically right. They’re just using different denominators.That contrast is exactly why the HYPE DATs make for a clean case study. We’ll break down each company, walk through the math, and show where people can get tripped up. Treasury: 1,535,772 HYPE × $48 = $73,717,056 Price: $10.34 Takeaway: On realized shares HYPD trades at 0.79x. That’s a discount. Once you layer in dilution it jumps to 5–8x, which is firmly premium. Treasury: 12,600,000 HYPE × $48 = $604,800,000 Price: $5.66 Takeaway: On today’s count SONN screens at 0.06x. That’s a massive discount. On the real post-merge base it’s a 5.27x premium. Same stock, two different answers. Treasury: - 194,726 HYPE × $48 = $9,346,848- 6,707 SOL × $220 = $1,475,540- Total = $10,822,388Price: $1.43 Takeaway: On realized and realistic shares LGHL trades under 0.1x. That’s a steep discount. On maximum it jumps to 4x premium. The swing is all about which share count you pick. Informed decision making becomes paramount when you consider such discrepancies. Yahoo currently shows: Three different answers from the same site. Now convert the float to ADS instead of ordinary:- 904,930,000 ÷ 2,500 = 361,972 ADS- Marketcap = $517,622- mNAV = 0.0478x Still wrong, but at least consistent. The correct counts from filings are 737,193 ADS (realized), 742,993 ADS (realistic), and 30,406,496 ADS (maximum). Those give 0.0974x, 0.0982x, and 4.0177x. Lesson: Yahoo Finance mixes units and lags filings. Always go back to the SEC. Key: <1x = Discount- 1x = Equal- >1x = Premium mNAV is the backbone of the DAT trade. It won’t replace judgment, but it grounds it. With clean numbers you know when you’re buying tokens at a discount, equal value, or paying a premium. That’s the difference between trading narratives and trading based on numbers. Prices move fast, narratives move faster, but underneath all the noise each ticker is just a wrapper around a pile of tokens. If you’re sloppy with the numbers, you’ll fool yourself. Everyone wants the shortcut. Use today’s SONN share count instead of the post-merge count and it’ll look like a steal at 0.06x. In reality, it’s a 5.27x premium. Take LGHL’s ordinary shares and multiply them by the ADS price and, suddenly, you end up with mNAVs in the hundreds or thousands of x. Rely on Yahoo’s “float” line and you may as well be pulling numbers out of thin air. The fix is simple. Stick with filings, pick your lens, and stay consistent or simply use DeFiLlama. This way you’ll actually know if you’re buying tokens at a discount, equal value, or paying a premium. mNAV won’t tell you everything. Sentiment, liquidity, and timing all still very much matter and should be factored in for. mNAV alone won’t replace judgment, but it grounds it. With clean numbers, you know when you’re buying tokens at a discount, equal value, or paying a premium. That’s how you avoid chasing what can look like free money and then getting steamrolled when the market reprices overnight. The edge in DATs is about doing the math right using the most-up-to-date data while others cut corners. All the mNAVs on DeFiLlama’s website are standardized to using tokens only, which is simpler to calculate but not the same as Enterprise Value as such you may find discrepancies when comparing mNAV values from MSTR’s website for example. Always check to see if there is an express mention of what variables are being utilized to calculate a reported mNAV when dealing with different sources.

Title: Warning: This 8% Dividend Pick Will Be Controversial

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Near the end of 2022, a reader wrote in to tell me that my bullish view of the economy at the time was off the mark. From his vantage point, people were struggling, prices were soaring, and wages weren’t keeping up. This reader wasn’t alone—it was around that time that Bloomberg wrote that the chances of a recession in the next year were 100%. So there was zero chance of avoiding one, in other words. We all know what happened next: The economy and stock market took off. That translated into real gains (and high income) for the portfolio of my CEF Insider service. In our equity bucket, for example, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a long-time holding (more than eight years) posted a total return that topped the S&P 500 from the end of 2022 to the time of this writing. Today, we see a very similar situation, with pessimism running high. The difference now is that stocks are hitting all-time highs, causing a lot of investors (maybe you among them) to ponder selling ahead of a coming downturn. We contrarians, of course, know that when the crowd fears something will happen, something else usually does. Which is why ADX remains a buy, even though (and indeed because) the closed-end fund (CEF) holds high-flying tech stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon.com (AMZN), plus strong blue chips in other sectors, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Here’s why I’m so bullish on stocks—and CEFs—like these. A Strong—Yet Hated—Economy First, we need to say upfront that large companies are seeing surging revenue, with 6.2% year-over-year gains, according to the Financial Times. These gains come from across sectors—with one exception: Energy. That’s understandable, and it’s actually good for US consumers and companies except for, well, Big Oil. Moreover, every sector but consumer discretionary is posting accelerating sales—that is, this year’s gains are bigger than last year’s. That’s the first part of the reason why I’m bullish on funds like ADX. But consider also broader retail spending, excluding cars and gas. It’s a key measure, since people buy cars in long cycles and gas is volatile, so both can skew the numbers. Here we see strong demand for goods and services—another plus for the economy. The outlook is positive, too, with the Federal Reserve’s GDPNow indicator, the most up-to-the-minute metric we have, showing growth above 3%, way above beyond Wall Street economists’ estimates. Why are economists—and indeed most investors—feeling dour, then? Let’s take a closer look at this, starting with what might seem like a pretty weird indicator at first. This chart shows wage growth for workers who are neither managers nor business owners over the past 30 years (the dotted line). It stacks that up against the increase of the cost dining out (the solid line). Like I said, a weird one! But stick with me because it shows these workers’ average earnings have risen more than the cost dining out. The takeaway: Average Americans have more money to eat out, and that’s actually a reasonably good barometer of middle-class wealth gains. But there are drawbacks to this chart, mainly that it doesn’t show things like costs for education, healthcare and other basics. All of these are becoming heavier burdens for the lower middle class. And since these people are a big part of the economy, this makes things look tougher for many Americans. Indeed, they are tougher. We can make of that what each of us will, of course, but we always endeavor to stay out of politics here at Contrarian Outlook—and focus solely on what the data is telling us. And that is this: The US economy is growing strongly, even though the lower middle class is struggling. It follows, then, that the rich are driving more corporate sales. This is bad for social welfare, sure, but from an economic perspective, it just means the kinds of things being sold are changing and the number of people buying them is shrinking. Bloomberg has some good data on this, showing that the top 10% of income earners now account for nearly 50% of total consumer spending—a record high. Now, we might worry that if the number of people driving revenue growth keeps shrinking, a pullback would result. And I agree. But wealthy Americans’ share of consumer spending also skyrocketed in the late 1990s, and I know I don’t have to tell you what stocks have done since then. So, no matter where each of us stand on the rich being a bigger part of the economy, this isn’t necessarily bad for business. In fact, in many cases, it can be good for business. But it absolutely can result in higher pessimism overall. And pessimism, as we contrarians know, provides buying opportunities. Which brings me back to ADX, which, despite the S&P 500 levitating higher, has seen its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) widen in the last three months. Today, we have a chance to buy this smartly run CEF for 9% off. That’s partly a hangover from a change ADX made to its distribution in 2024. Under its old scheme, the fund paid minuscule regular dividends and made up for those with a huge end-of-year special payout that varied depending on its NAV performance. Now, ADX targets an 8% annualized payout (based on NAV), paid four times a year. So if NAV rises, so does the payout. That’s much more investor-friendly, and it’s caused ADX’s discount to narrow slightly in the last year or so, but not as much as it should. That’s our chance to buy, as ADX is positioned to benefit from themes like the spread of AI and the resulting build-out of data centers. And we can get in at that 9% discount—thanks again to investor pessimism and misunderstanding. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Regulators weigh billion-dollar utility takeovers as bills rise for consumers

Time Published: 2025-09-27T11:43:39Z

Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. RELATED STORY | As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. About Scripps News

Title: How Ripple’s XRP Can Help Address The Global Debt Crisis, According To Black Swan Capitalist Founder

The founder of Black Swan Capitalist believes that XRP, which spent years fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court, could play a pivotal role in solving the global debt crisis by restructuring the financial system. Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah took to the X social media platform to suggest that global debt cannot be repaid under current conditions and must first be restructured. The real solution, in his opinion, involves converting trillions into tokenized liquidity running on neutral assets such as Ripple-affiliated XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins. Global debt can't be paid back. It has to be restructured.The real play is converting trillions into tokenized liquidity running on neutral assets like XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins.Cycles reward those who prepare before the narrative, not after. pic.twitter.com/pEYIswQ9jd “Trillions in debt will be tokenized,” he asserted in a different post. “But only XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside.” Aljarrah’s remarks come as large swaths of institutions increasingly experiment with the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain rails in the new era of programmable finance. Tokenization of RWAs is the process of converting ownership or rights to physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger. This strategy leverages blockchain technology to convert tangible assets such as real estate, artwork, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens that can be conveniently bought, sold, and traded on-chain. These talks of XRP unlocking debt liquidity follow a report from the International Monetary Fund revealing that global debt currently stands at around $250 trillion (or 235% of GDP). An increase in public borrowing to nearly $100 trillion last year helped offset reductions in private sector debt. These figures underscore how tokenized liquidity could prove key in easing the overwhelming debt burden. Ripple is gaining traction in the burgeoning tokenization sector. DBS, Franklin Templeton, and Ripple have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on offering trading and lending solutions that leverage tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger blockchain and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Moreover, the $740.4 million RLUSD stablecoin was recently integrated into a new smart contract on Securitize’s platform as an off-ramp option for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized money-market funds.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy After Vanguard’s Big Crypto ETF Shift

Time Published: 2025-09-27T10:27:28Z

Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund management company, has long stood firm on its old-fashioned anti-crypto stance. Back in January 2024, the company stated it would not offer cryptocurrency exposure to its clients, arguing that the assets were too volatile and incapable of generating sustainable long-term returns. This shift comes in response to strong client demand and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment around the crypto industry. Unlike BlackRock, which has launched its own crypto ETF, Vanguard has no immediate plans to roll out a fund of its own. Instead, its first step would be to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. Read on as we uncover more about Vanguard’s future plans, as well as highlight the best altcoins to buy right now. Although Vanguard has openly criticized cryptocurrencies, it also happens to be the largest shareholder in Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR). Today, Strategy is hands down the largest corporate accumulator of Bitcoin, with 639,835 tokens in its kitty. Vanguard itself owns 20M shares in MicroStrategy, representing around 8% ownership. Adding to this, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as its CEO in July 2024. With 25 years of industry experience, Ramji was instrumental in launching BlackRock’s iBIT spot Bitcoin ETF while leading the firm’s global ETF business. His appointment was widely viewed as a signal that Vanguard might eventually pivot toward a more crypto-friendly stance. However, in August, the new CEO clarified that Vanguard had no immediate plans to launch any crypto ETFs. Still, while the company has shied away from direct crypto investment vehicles, there have always been subtle hints pointing in the opposite direction. With competitors like BlackRock leading the charge, Vanguard’s rigidity risks alienating pro-crypto investors. Perhaps that’s what has sparked its recent shift in mindset. With Vanguard finally stepping onto the crypto ship, there couldn’t be a better time to start building your own crypto portfolio. But simply stacking blue-chip digital assets won’t be enough; you’ll need to spot and invest in promising low-cap coins early. Here are our top 3 suggestions. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain designed to solve issues of Web3 compatibility, speed, and scalability. While Bitcoin is the face of the crypto industry, it still lags behind when it comes to innovation and adaptability. For example, Bitcoin can still only process around 7 transactions per second with a block time of 10 minutes. By contrast, Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin Hyper addresses this gap by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aka the same technology that powers Solana’s high throughput. This integration allows developers to build dApps and execute smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. The SVM uses parallel execution, meaning it can process multiple transactions simultaneously as long as they’re not related. While these transactions occur off-chain, you won’t have to compromise Bitcoin’s renowned Layer 1 security. Supporting this is a non-custodial canonical bridge that locks up your Layer 1 Bitcoin and mints an equivalent amount of Web3-compatible Layer 2 tokens. This utility-driven approach has already helped the $HYPER presale raise $18.5M. At present, 1 $HYPER costs just $0.012985, and based on our $HYPER price prediction, the token could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025, representing a potential 2,364% return. Interested? Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn more about this new cryptocurrency project. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers a new content creation and sharing platform aiming to disrupt the $85B industry with innovation and transparency. Imagine spending hours conceptualizing, planning, shooting, and editing a piece of content, only for the platform to take 70% of your revenue in the name of platform and management fees. Infuriating, right? That’s why many content creators are shifting to SUBBD, which charges only a fraction of creators’ earnings as fees. In return, it offers a full suite of AI tools – voice generators, text, image, and video creators – to help produce engaging content. This frees up more time for creators to interact directly with fans and build loyal communities. But it’s not just creators who benefit from SUBBD. Holders of the $SUBBD token can access premium content, subscribe to their favorite creators, request personalized videos, and even send tips as tokens of appreciation. The $SUBBD presale is live and has already pulled in over $1.2M, with each token available for just $0.05652. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD. According to our $SUBBD price prediction, it could surge to $0.301 by the end of 2025, delivering a staggering 432% return on investment. For more details, check out SUBBD Token’s official website. MemeCore ($M) is an innovative Layer-1 blockchain that aims to change how investors perceive meme coins today. Even the best meme coins are often seen merely as fun, speculative assets – entertainment-driven cryptocurrencies that thrive on virality and on-chain activity with little to no utility. MemeCore challenges this by introducing a unique Proof-of-Meme (PoM) mechanism, built on the belief that every on-chain activity strengthens the network. It records and rewards all forms of participation, whether it’s creating and sharing memes, staking, or trading tokens. $M serves as the platform’s native currency, powering all on-chain transactions, gas fees, and reward distributions. On the technical front, MemeCore ($M) gave a strong breakout on September 4 when it broke past its long-term resistance at $1. After hitting an all-time high of $2.96 on September 18, the token is now trading at $2.33 with strong support at $2.12. While the broader crypto market pauses for breath, MemeCore too is consolidating nicely between $3 and $2.12. A breakout above its previous high could propel the token to a new peak of $4 in the coming weeks. Want in? Buy $M on BingX or any of the other crypto exchanges.

Title: 8 Years In Hiding—Now $3 Billion In Ether Comes Alive

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A major Ethereum holder that had been quiet for years suddenly moved roughly 200,000 ETH Friday, worth about $800 million at current prices. Based on reports from on-chain trackers, the investor controls a total of 736,316 ETH spread across eight wallets — holdings that are now valued nearly $3 billion. The activity caught attention because several of those addresses had been inactive for years, making this one of the more notable returns by an early-era holder. According to blockchain observers, the transferred coins were not sent to trading venues. Instead, the funds were directed into new addresses tied to staking services, including Ethereum’s Plasma infrastructure, where assets can earn yield while remaining locked. Two wallets that have been dormant for over 8 years just woke up and moved 200K $ETH($785M) to 2 new addresses. This Ethereum OG originally sourced their $ETH primarily from #Bitfinex, currently holds a total of 736,316 $ETH($2.89B) across 8 wallets. Wallets:… pic.twitter.com/wVFzXZcL0o — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 26, 2025 Emmett Gallic, an analyst who flagged the movement, described the action as “bullish.” The choice to stake rather than sell has been noted by market watchers as a possible signal of long-term confidence in Ethereum’s prospects. Reports have disclosed that much of the ETH came from Bitfinex and mining pools active around 2017. Some of the wallets had last moved funds about four years ago; others had been dormant for over eight years. At the time those coins were last active, their combined worth was about $30 million. That figure contrasts sharply with today’s value, which approaches $3 billion, highlighting how much the asset has changed hands in value even for those who stayed put. Ethereum’s price was under stress when the whale reappeared. Based on market data, ETH dipped to $3,829 today, a low not seen since August. Reports show institutional vehicles have been selling recently: ETFs recorded roughly $547 million in outflows over four consecutive days earlier this week. On Thursday, all ETFs logged net outflows except BlackRock, which posted neither inflows nor outflows that day. That said, BlackRock had sold close to $27 million worth of ETH the previous day. These moves appear to have helped push the price lower ahead of the whale’s action. Analysts have pointed out that a large transfer like this would normally stoke fears of a liquidation. In this case, the absence of exchange deposits seemed to calm some traders. Staking shifts coins off liquid markets and can reduce immediate sell pressure. Still, the broader sell-off from ETF products has been sizable and may keep acting as a drag on price until flows stabilize.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: $10 Trillion Asset Manager Vanguard Prepares To Offer Access To Crypto ETFs For The First Time

One of the world’s largest asset managers, Vanguard, is reportedly preparing to enter the digital asset space by offering access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time. This move comes after a period of skepticism from the firm, which manages approximately $10 trillion in assets. According to a Friday report from Crypto in America, a source familiar with Vanguard’s plans has disclosed that the company has begun laying the groundwork for this initiative due to increasing client demand for digital assets and a more favorable regulatory environment. While Vanguard is not planning to launch its own crypto products, as competitors like BlackRock have done, it is reportedly considering granting brokerage customers access to select third-party crypto ETFs. However, the timeline for this decision remains uncertain. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source remarked, highlighting the cautious yet adaptive strategy Vanguard is adopting in response to evolving market conditions. Vanguard’s plans come as under President Donald Trump’s administration, regulatory agencies have significantly shifted their approach toward crypto assets, led by the SEC’s drop of enforcement cases, new frameworks for the growth and adoption of crypto assets and related products. The SEC’s recent approval of a new generic listing standard is expected to expedite the approval process for crypto ETFs, alongside the greenlighting of index funds that include leading crypto assets, further contributing to renewed stances from asset managers like Vanguard. Vanguard’s CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously spent a decade at BlackRock overseeing the successful launch of its Bitcoin ETF, has been at the forefront of this strategy. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has attracted over $60 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024, amassing more than $80 billion in assets. Since taking the helm at Vanguard last year, Ramji’s leadership style has been closely watched, with many speculating whether he might emulate strategies from his former boss, Larry Fink. In January of last year, Vanguard had publicly stated that “Spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,” dismissing the notion of offering crypto-related products. This decision led some users to threaten account closures due to dissatisfaction with Vanguard’s stance on digital assets. At the July Morningstar Investment Conference, Ramji reiterated that the asset management firm would not replicate competitors by launching its own crypto ETFs. However, he avoided directly addressing the possibility of offering access to third-party crypto ETFs. Yet, as the performance of crypto ETFs has significantly improved over the past year, the firm’s views appear to be evolving, in line with broader market trends and regulatory shifts that are fostering a new era for digital assets.

Title: Kingspan chases Magnificent Seven energy with plan to float unit riding on AI boom
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/27/kingspan-chases-magnificent-seven-energy-with-plan-to-float-unit-riding-on-ai-boom/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T05:45:00Z
Full Content:
Fed up with Kingspan shares drifting behind peers and the wider market, Gene Murtagh is seeking to tap into some of the energy of the Magnificent Seven (Mag-7), the US tech stocks that have driven a three-year bull run across global equity markets. The Kingspan chief executive revealed on Tuesday that the insulation giant founded 60 years ago by his father, Eugene, plans to float 25 per cent of its advanced building systems unit Advnsys, which is focused on supplying the global data centres boom, in Amsterdam. The mushrooming of data centres has been turbocharged by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that has driven the share prices in recent times of Mag-7 stalwarts such as chipmaker Nvidia, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet and Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram. Close to $7 trillion (€6 trillion) will need to be spent on data centres globally by 2030, driven by demand for hubs equipped to handle AI processing loads, McKinsey, the management consultancy firm, estimated in a recent report. “We’re acutely cognisant of the fact that relevant sector peers – and these are not building sector peers, they’re tech-end peers that are supplying the data centre market – are trading at and above 20 times Ebitda,” Murtagh said on a call with analysts, referring to how others in the data centre space are being valued by the stock market at more than 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Valuing Advnsys along these lines would give it an initial market capitalisation of at least €6 billion. [ Kingspan shares soar on potential €6bn flotation of unit riding data centres boomOpens in new window ] Kingspan had lost more than a third of its market value in the four years before the move was announced – and was down 21 per cent on the year as it grappled with what Murtagh recently described as an ongoing “pretty unforgiving environment” for construction suppliers globally as households and businesses fret about a potential recession. The group is trading at about 10 times Ebitda – compared with its 10-year average of 13.5. Compare that with Vertiv, an Ohio-based provider of critical infrastructure and services for data centres, whose stock has soared more than 400 per cent over the past four years. Or with Trane Technologies, the Swords-headquartered but New York-listed maker of heating and cooling systems for commercial buildings, whose market value has more than doubled in the same period, to $90 billion, amid a surge in demand for its data centre air-cooling systems. The AI boom – like red-hot stock market trends before it – has attracted blatantly cynical pivots and rebrands from companies trying to jump on the bandwagon. But Kingspan has been a supplier to the data centres market since before Murtagh became CEO 20 years ago. The new Advnsys unit being lined up for an initial public offering (IPO) – which combines its data centre solutions and light, air and water businesses into one – is a world leader in bespoke critical infrastructure primarily focused on data centres, ventilation and daylighting. [ Kingspan trades profit for position in US roofing raceOpens in new window ] While about 40 per cent of Advnsys’s earnings currently come from providing infrastructure to the tech sector, particularly to data centres, this is expected to grow to about 75 per cent of an even bigger business in the next three to five years, according to the group. Citigroup analysts reckon the subsidiary could more than double its revenue and Ebitda between 2024 and 2030, to €3.2 billion and €525 million, respectively. Shares in Kingspan jumped as much as 13.5 per cent to €74.85 on Tuesday morning, but have since handed back almost half their gains as some analysts urged caution. “While we understand the [market] reaction, particularly in light of the stock’s weaker performance year-to-date, we do not yet understand how a partial IPO creates additional value, nor how the market will arbitrage valuation between the two businesses,” said JP Morgan analysts led by Elodie Rall in a note to clients. Advnsys may attract a higher valuation multiple, but this is likely to be offset by the market giving the rest of the business – comprising insulated panels, other insulation solutions and its roofing and waterproofing unit – a lower one, she said. [ Kingspan plans €650m share buy back as half year revenues rise 8% to record €4.5bnOpens in new window ] Bernstein’s Pujarini Ghosh said the market excitement earlier in the week had been “overdone” and her €70 price target on the group points to almost 3 per cent downside from here. A listing of Advnsys in New York “could potentially have helped unlock greater value given the business mix will be more heavily skewed to the US”, she said. About 45 per cent of the unit’s business is exposed to the US, but this is expected to rise well above 50 per cent in the coming years. Murtagh said the decision to float on Euronext Amsterdam is down to the high level of trading in stocks in that market, a lack of stamp duty there, too, and how the same accounting standard (IFRS) applies to companies in the Netherlands and Ireland. For sure, the level of trading in Euronext Dublin has slumped over the past five years amid a number of company exits and a dearth of fresh IPOs. [ How Kingspan stands to benefit from AI boomOpens in new window ] But to avoid the 1 per cent stamp duty applied to share trading in Irish companies, Kingspan will need to incorporate Advnsys as a public limited company – or naamloze vennootschap (NV) – in the Netherlands. A nice bonus from the planned IPO is that it would, according to Murtagh. leave both Kingspan and Advnsys “essentially with zero debt” – giving them plenty of scope to invest and grow by acquisition. Whereas Kingspan’s share price tends to move with the broader construction industry cycle, Advnsys’s stock will be far more sensitive to developments in AI, making it potentially much more volatile. Chinese tech group DeepSeek, for example, showed the world earlier this year that its approach to generative AI needs just a fraction of the computing power of more prominent US tools, such as ChatGPT. Could demand for data centres decline as AI systems become more efficient? One thing’s for sure: savvy investors in Advnsys in Amsterdam will have alerts set for anything coming from another company 9,000km away. For now, Nvidia in Santa Clara, California, remains the bellwether for all things AI.

Title: Anti-Bitcoin Investment Giant Vanguard Reportedly Considering Crypto ETF Access For Customers In Dramatic U-Turn

Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), is reportedly reconsidering its stance on offering its clientele access to such investment vehicles. According to a Sept. 26 report from Crypto in America, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, Vanguard is now examining ways to satisfy customer demand for digital assets amid the evolving regulatory environment. Notably, Vanguard does not intend to introduce its own products. Instead, the famously anti-Bitcoin investment manager is exploring whether to give clients access to third-party crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform, even as its biggest competitor, BlackRock, launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF in history to achieve the $80 billion assets under management record. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source reportedly stated. Vanguard staunchly indicated that it wouldn’t offer its clients trading access to any of the dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that went live on US exchanges in January 2024, citing the crypto’s high volatility as bad for generating long-term returns. The company in July last year named Salim Ramji, the pro-crypto ex-BlackRock exec, to take the reins from his predecessor CEO Tim Buckley, leading to speculation of a reversal of the decision to shun BTC ETFs. However, Ramji poured water on the idea that he had any intentions for the asset management giant to change its approach to crypto funds. “Vanguard is looking to end Bitcoin ETF ban (aka bend the knee lol),” Bloomberg Senior’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed on X. “We heard chatter of this too. Smart of them imo. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are hugely popular and Salim was one of IBIT’s midwives so he knows.” <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Vanguard is looking to end bitcoin ETF ban (aka bend the knee lol). &quot;The dynamics have been changing&quot; Nice scoop by Eleanor.

Obv many are not the bitcoin type but that’s massive, they are biggest fund company in the US by two times over,” Balchunas added. Bitcoin fell below $109,000 yesterday, marking its weakest price in almost a month. The premier crypto has since reclaimed the $110,000 psychological threshold, but it remains to be seen whether the rebound is sustainable.

Title: AI's energy demand draws investment firms to local utilities

(Brooks Johnson/Star Tribune via AP) People leave the The BlackRock investment company in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York, Tuesday, March 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock. On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills. In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates. In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years. However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs. It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock. In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns. They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Private equity sees profits in power utilities as electric bills rise and Big Tech seeks more energy

WEATHER ALERT Marc Levy Associated Press Published: September 27, 2025 at 12:01 AM Marc Levy Associated Press HARRISBURG, Pa. – Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. Recommended Videos “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said. Deals are in the works In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. Big players on both sides The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock. On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills. In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates. In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years. However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs. Skepticism from regulators It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock. In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns. They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Online Selling 101: How To Start & Where To Sell Fast

Time Published: 2025-09-27T04:00:12Z

September 27, 2025 • Fact checked by Dumb Little Man Let’s be real—online selling is everywhere, and if you’re not in the game yet, you’re leaving money on the table. People are no longer waiting in lines at the mall. They’re scrolling, clicking, and expecting their shop orders to land on their doorstep in two days. And honestly? It’s never been easier to jump in and start selling yourself. Here’s the thing: an online business doesn’t mean you need to rent a big warehouse or hire a team overnight. It means you can create an online store, list your items, and have buyers finding you with just a few clicks. With platforms giving you powerful tools and resources, you can sell smarter and reach new customers without drowning in startup costs. Since buyers love popular products, especially when they see recent sales, you’ll be in a position to score more sales faster than you think. Why has this model gained popularity? Because it’s flexible, affordable, and scalable. Sellers can sell online while working full-time jobs, during college, or even between Netflix streams. The barriers are low, the demand is high, and the opportunities? Endless. You just need the right mindset, a little hustle, and the right tools to make it work. So grab your coffee and your ambition—because I’m about to walk you through how to start online selling, where to sell, and the exact steps to make your store shine. An online store is basically your digital shopfront. Instead of opening in a mall, you’re open in the world—24/7. With the right setup, you can sell almost anything, from clothes to electronics to handmade crafts. And because the buyer pays upfront, you get to skip a lot of the messy in-person transactions that eat up time and energy. Here’s what makes an online store work: you create a space where buyers can scroll through your listing, check reviews, and hit checkout without ever leaving their couch. And the good news? You don’t need to be a tech genius. Platforms like eBay, Etsy, and Facebook Marketplace make it easy to create a store that works in minutes. With the right setup, you’re basically in business overnight. Why is an online store so powerful? Because it gives you a chance to build your brand, showcase quality products, and reach new customers. With smart design, fair price points, and reliable shipping, your store becomes a place people trust. The trust you build here equals more buyers and more sales, and trust me—people return to stores they believe in. An online store isn’t just a website; it’s your entry ticket into a booming market. Done right, it becomes your personal empire, one click at a time. The biggest question every seller asks is: “What do I sell?” Here’s the magic: you need to identify trending products before everyone else jumps in. That’s how you land more sales and new customers who are desperate to buy. If you wait until the whole world knows about a product, you’ll be competing with thousands of sellers—and your store risks getting lost. Your best friend here? Google Trends. It shows what’s hot, what’s not, and what trends are picking up steam. For example, if you see increased interest in self care gadgets or outdoor activities gear, you know there’s a growing trend worth chasing. The earlier you catch it, the more you stand out in a crowded marketplace. But don’t confuse quick fads with consistent demand. A phone case that goes viral might change quickly, but skincare tools with steady interest? That’s gold. The trick is knowing which specific products belong to which product category. And yes, this takes research, not guesswork. Here’s the tea: trending products come and go, but the sellers who learn to track trends and react fast? They’re the ones who get better results. Google Trends isn’t just a graph; it’s your crystal ball for business growth. So, you’ve seen some trending products on Google Trends—but hold up. Before you rush to list them, you need to pick the right product category. Why? Because your category is the foundation of your store, your listings, and your brand. Without a clear focus, you’ll confuse your buyers and limit your sales potential. A solid product category makes it easier to create targeted listings, attract the right buyers, and build consistent demand. Some hot categories right now include: These categories don’t just spike—they show a growing trend and loyal customers who come back for more. When you pick wisely, you’ll have a reliable lane for your brand and a clear market to target. But here’s the warning: don’t just chase hype. Trending products that vanish overnight can leave you with unsold inventory. Instead, balance hype with stability. Choose a category that has both popular products and long-term demand, so your store thrives today and in the future. Now let’s talk money—because your business of online selling isn’t a hobby once you’ve got a proper account. Step one? Open a dedicated bank account. You need it to process payments safely and keep your finances clean. Mixing your business with your personal spending is a rookie mistake, and it’ll make taxes a nightmare. Step two: set up an account on platforms where you want to sell online. Whether it’s eBay, Amazon, or a Facebook shop, each one has its own rules. The key is making sure that when the buyer pays, the money goes straight into your bank account without hiccups. Nothing kills a vibe faster than missing payments. Step three: don’t ignore fees. Some platforms take a cut every time an item sells, so you need to calculate price points wisely. That means understanding your category, knowing your costs for shipping, and setting a price that covers expenses while still attracting buyers. The company you choose to host your store will also determine how you process payments, so read the fine print. When you’ve got your accounts set up properly, you can finally focus on sales instead of stressing over transactions. That’s how you turn your hustle into a legit business with steady revenue. And honestly? That’s the glow-up you came here for. Your listings are the heart of your store. A sloppy post with bad photos and vague details won’t get you buyers. But a polished, clear listing? That’s where the magic happens, and that’s how you rack up sales. Start with visuals. High-quality images sell. Show the product from different angles, include close-ups, and keep the background simple. This helps buyers trust the quality of what they see. Add reviews if you have them—social proof is everything when convincing new customers to hit “buy now.” Next up: the description. Be specific. Cover the product category, size, materials, and any key features. Avoid fluff and focus on what makes this item sell. Make sure your listing is easy to read with bullet points, so people can skim and still get the info. Adding keywords that match what buyers search for in your market helps you appear higher in results. Finally, the price. Research competitors in your marketplace, compare price points, and set something fair. Too cheap, and people question quality. Too high, and you lose buyers. Get it right, and you’ll see more sales roll in, especially when paired with clear shipping options and transparent timelines. Okay, let’s talk logistics. If your shipping is a mess, your store won’t survive. Customers want fast, reliable delivery, and if they don’t get it, they’ll leave a bad review that scares off more buyers. Good shipping equals repeat sales, and repeat sales are the backbone of a sustainable business. First, pick reliable carriers and offer tracking. This gives your buyers peace of mind knowing their item sells and ships safely. Step two: manage your inventory. Keep track of stock levels so you don’t oversell and disappoint customers. Running out is bad, but overselling is worse. Use tools that alert you when stock runs low to stay ahead. Packaging matters too. Deliver quality by using sturdy boxes, bubble wrap, or eco-friendly materials if that’s part of your brand. Popular products deserve packaging that matches their value. Remember, unboxing is part of the experience, and it can help attract loyal buyers who love sharing it on social media. With organized inventory and solid shipping, your store will run smoother. You’ll stress less, your buyers will be happier, and you’ll build a reputation for reliability. And trust me, reliability = more sales and better results. Now the juicy part—where should you actually sell online? Luckily, there are tons of marketplaces that make it easy to reach more buyers. But not all are created equal, so let’s break it down. Each marketplace has its own rules, fees, and tools, so choose based on your product category and audience. Some work better for popular products with consistent demand, while others are a test ground for new products. The key is picking platforms that match your brand and give you better results. When you choose the right marketplace, you’ll not only start online selling faster but also expand your reach and build success for the future. Here’s the truth—social media isn’t just for memes and selfies anymore. It’s one of the most powerful tools sellers have to grow their stores. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok are basically free billboards where you can promote your brand, showcase listings, and grab the attention of new customers. Want more buyers? Post content that shows your quality products in action. People love seeing how an item sells in real life. Add behind-the-scenes stories, review highlights, or unboxing clips to spark interest. These posts make your brand relatable and trustworthy. To make social work for you, here are some tips: But don’t just post and ghost. Engage! Reply to comments, answer questions, and build a community around your store. A loyal community not only buys from you but also helps you promote your shop for free. Done right, social isn’t optional—it’s essential for modern business. Numbers don’t lie, and if you want success, you need to know what they’re saying. Tracking recent sales, reading reviews, and watching trends give you the clearest picture of what’s working in your store. It’s like having a GPS in the wild jungle of e-commerce—you know exactly where to go instead of guessing. Start by checking your listings. Which item sells the fastest? Which ones are collecting dust? Which products bring in new customers consistently? These patterns tell you where to double down and where to back off. Pair this info with Google Trends to see where increased interest is showing up in your product category. If you see demand rising, stock up before the buyers shift their focus. Then come the reviews. Honestly, they’re gold. They reveal what buyers love, what they hate, and what they wish was different. Use these insights to adjust your price, improve quality, or update your packaging. Ignoring reviews is a mistake that costs you sales—feedback is literally free coaching. By tracking sales data and monitoring trends, you’re not just online selling—you’re making informed decisions that put you ahead in the market. Knowledge is your edge, and the sellers who study their numbers always win the long game. Short-term wins are thrilling, but long-term success is the real goal. Once your store has a steady rhythm, it’s time to expand. That can mean adding new products, exploring another product category, or even launching your own website to step outside big marketplaces. Growth takes planning, not luck. The secret sauce? Build a brand that people trust. Shoppers don’t just buy items; they buy loyalty, values, and reputation. When buyers feel connected to your brand, they’ll keep coming back, leave glowing reviews, and tell their friends. That kind of trust creates a ripple effect—bringing in more buyers without extra effort. Automation is your best friend here. Use tools to manage inventory, streamline shipping, and track sales. The less time you spend on repetitive tasks, the more time you have to create growth strategies and focus on scaling your business. It’s about working smarter, not harder. Remember: online selling is a marathon, not a sprint. If you focus on building steadily, your store won’t just survive—it’ll thrive as trends evolve. Sustainable growth is the kind that sets you up for the future, and that’s where true domination happens. Let’s spill the tea—new sellers often sabotage themselves without realizing it. Some mistakes are small, but others can ruin your chances of success if you don’t catch them early. So, here’s the list of what not to do. Avoid these pitfalls, and you’ll be way ahead of most beginners. Learn fast, stay sharp, and remember—buyers reward sellers who are reliable, polished, and prepared. Don’t let silly mistakes block your path to long-term success. Here’s the truth: online selling isn’t just a side hustle anymore—it’s a full-blown opportunity to build real success. Whether you’re listing on eBay, promoting on Facebook, or running your own website, the chance to sell and earn is massive. But it all comes down to whether you’re ready to start. The winning formula? Pick a solid product category, use the right tools, set fair price points, and deliver quality products. Manage your shipping, stay on top of your inventory, and actually listen to buyers through reviews. These habits build trust, bring in new customers, and lead to more sales. So, are you ready to jump in? Stop watching from the sidelines while others cash out. Create your store, claim your corner of the market, and go after it. The future of e-commerce is already here—and it’s wide open for anyone with hustle. Your business deserves to shine. Don’t just scroll. Sell. And sell like you mean it.

Title: BlackRock Exec Pressed On XRP ETF: His Answer Raises More Questions
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-exec-xrp-etf-answer-more-questions/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T01:00:31Z

BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, was pressed on the prospect of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund during an interview with Nate Geraci on the “Crypto Prime” podcast. While he offered no product reveal, he did spell out precisely how BlackRock is thinking about what could come next after its blockbuster Bitcoin and Ether launches. Geraci noted on air that he has “publicly predicted that BlackRock would file for a spot XRP ETF and a spot Solana ETF,” then asked how the firm evaluates “future product development around crypto-related ETFs.” Mitchnick declined to speak to any specific tickers but was explicit about the decision framework: “There’s a lot of factors that go into that decision-making process obviously, but the biggest driver ultimately is our clients… What is the level of investor demand? What is the logic and investment thesis for investors and for our clients around these potential products? What problem are we solving for them?” He added that BlackRock weighs “market cap, liquidity, [and] maturity,” along with “clarity of investment thesis and overall… portfolio considerations,” describing it as “a constant evaluation process,” not a single point in time. The exchange came amid a wide-ranging discussion of how quickly BlackRock’s crypto business has scaled and how starkly the firm differentiates Bitcoin from Ether in client portfolios. My conversation w/ BlackRock’s @robbiemitchnick… We discuss: -Massive success of IBIT & ETHA -Btc & eth in broader portfolio -Staking in spot eth ETFs -Generic listing standards -Crypto ETF development -Tokenization -Stablecoinshttps://t.co/54NgVDFpVJ via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/N5H4EnI7Q7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 25, 2025 Geraci highlighted the growth figures—“[IBIT] launched in early January 2024. It’s over $85 billion in assets… [ETHA] launched in July… around $16 billion”—and asked whether Ethereum’s trajectory matched expectations after Bitcoin’s record start. Mitchnick pushed back on early narratives that Ether ETFs were a “bust” only because they were “being compared against the extraordinary record-setting numbers” of Bitcoin, pointing out that ETHA became “the third fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion.” Mitchnick drew a bright line between the two assets from a portfolio-construction perspective. Bitcoin, he said, functions for many allocators as “this sort of digital gold type instrument,” a “global scarce decentralized non-sovereign asset” with distinct risk and return drivers. Ethereum is “a more nuanced, more technical discussion,” effectively “a bet around blockchain adoption and digital assets more broadly,” with competitive dynamics and questions about “value capture in the Ether token versus the activity level on the Ethereum blockchain.” As a result, Bitcoin has seen “much greater penetration” among institutional and wealth advisory channels, while Ether ownership remains “overwhelmingly” in the direct investor segment. On the gating factors that could unlock the next wave of demand, Mitchnick said it is “still early days” for both institutions and wealth platforms in the United States. Many large firms allow execution-only access, but “the vast majority of advisers… still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” He described “various stages of approving this” across the wirehouses, including one firm “starting to put it in model portfolios,” and noted that BlackRock’s own model-portfolio team “early in 2025… put IBIT allocations into one of our model portfolios.” For institutions, he argued that further episodes of Bitcoin “decoupling from equities in a… distressed market environment” would be “critical” in cementing its role as a diversifier. Asked about the SEC’s recent move to approve generic listing standards for commodity-based ETPs—the category that includes spot crypto ETFs—Mitchnick called it “a pragmatic step” that “streamlin[es] the process,” with clear, transparent standards that “support innovation.” Taken together, Mitchnick’s comments sketched the contours of BlackRock’s next steps without tipping its hand. On an XRP ETF, he didn’t confirm or deny anything—but he gave a clear readout of the bar any new product must clear: credible client demand, a defensible investment thesis, sufficient market depth and maturity, and a well-defined role in diversified portfolios. At press time, XRP traded at $2.71. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Pure, Concentrated Risk

By Adam Sharp PostedSeptember 26, 2025 Over the past 10 years, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to around $38,260. That’s based on the SPY ETF with dividends reinvested. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 would have turned every $10,000 into $58,866 over the same period. That’s based on the QQQ ETF and also assumes dividends are reinvested. Historically speaking, these are abnormally high returns. Instead of the 8% per year long-term average, broad U.S. stock indexes have essentially doubled that (or more) over the past decade. The question investors should be asking is: is this sustainable? My answer: no. Take a look at the chart below. It shows the S&P 500’s CAPE (cyclically adjusted price/earnings) ratio. This metric looks at 10 years of price-to-earnings, and adjusts for inflation. Source: Multpl via Meb Faber It’s also known as the Shiller PE ratio. When it’s sky high (like today) that means stocks are overvalued and should have low returns going forward. The Shiller PE ratio today is at 39. That’s quite close to the 2000 highs of around 44. And far above the 1929 peak of 34. And according to Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric, stocks are even more expensive than 2000. More on that in last month’s Bubble Poponomics. To me, this is yet another signal that we’re nearing a local peak in U.S. markets. However, the market often ends these bubbly periods with one last great “blow-off top”. Whether this recent move qualifies is subjective, but my guess is that we might see at least one more sharp move up before the party ends. These big gains in both the S&P and the Nasdaq have been driven by one sector: big tech. Specifically, the “Magnificent 7”: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. Over the past 10 years, the Mag 7 has returned a ridiculous 39% per year on average. Even among these high-flyers, NVIDIA stands out. It is now the largest company in the world with a market capitalization of $4.3 trillion. NVIDIA currently makes up a whopping 7.7% of the S&P 500. So out of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in America, a single stock makes up almost 8%. In total, the Mag 7 makes up about 34% of America’s standard benchmark index. The Nasdaq 100 is even more concentrated with big tech. NVIDIA makes up 9.42% of the Nasdaq 100. Microsoft accounts for 8.3%, and Apple 8.2%. The concentration risk here is extraordinary. At this point the fate of U.S. stock indexes are completely tied to this AI bubble. If (when) it falters, the house of cards will collapse. Consumer spending will plummet, then the broad market will follow. As tempting as it is to guess the exact moment when the bubble will pop, it’s ultimately futile. So besides a few tiny hedges, I am mostly avoiding shorting this market for now. Most of us who live in America have plenty of exposure to the U.S. economy. Through our jobs, investments, dollars, and homes. So it makes sense, in this environment, to hedge our bets. This is where gold and silver come into play. Miners too, of course. Precious metals are global assets which act as excellent hedges. In previous periods where bubbles popped, like after the dotcom one, precious metals and hard assets soared as formerly “hot sectors” plummeted. And our emerging market thesis is starting to pay off, with the iShares Brazil ETF (EWZ) now up around 20% since we first wrote up that story. Brazilian markets are cheap with big yields, and thus have a lot less far to fall if things go south. Oil is another contrarian bet I like. The energy sector is dirt cheap, offers fat dividend yields for compounding, and should offer significant protection against inflationary forces. More on that here. By now, you regular readers may be getting tired of me writing about how gold, silver, miners, oil, and emerging markets are excellent alternatives to the standard big U.S. indexes. But this is a point I really want to hammer home. We are entering what is sure to be a chaotic time for stocks, fiat currencies, and generally speaking, the world. Don’t let the new all-time index highs fool you. This is a precarious time. Look at gold and silver. They are sending a more urgent message. Something isn’t right, and savvy investors can feel it coming. Hedging our bets in this environment isn’t just a clever idea, it’s a necessity.

What caught my eye this week. I am definitely not saying that the massive megacap tech deals of the past fortnight will for sure end badly. Let alone that such deals must mark the top of this bull market. Credit with me some learning! After more than two decades of meddling in the markets – and nearly as long making public pronouncements on this blog and elsewhere – it’d be a sackable offence for me not to have learned a bit of humility along the way. Markets can remain irrational longer than you can believe what you’re reading on social media, as Keynes almost said. Markets also have a way of turning today’s ‘irrationality’ into tomorrow’s ‘crucial staging point that any fool could have identified’ if you wait long enough for the proper perspective. So yes, Nvidia investing $100bn in its major client OpenAI – or Oracle leveraging up to build out the data centre capacity required to fulfil the staggering $300bn compute deal it signed with OpenAI last week, which in turn inflated Oracle’s share price – may not be as Ponzi-ish as they look. But these mind-bendingly big deals at the very least represent a gear shift. Hitherto the hyperscalers (Meta, Google, Amazon et al) were just reinvesting their vast torrents of cashflow into building more data centres for paying customers. It was business as usual, albeit on steroids. However this new phase is more self-referential. Something akin to a tech oligarch blood pact, where they are going all-in on the AI revolution and they’ll sink or swim together. Sadly, I’m too old not to remember the Dotcom boom and bust at a time like this. Not just in terms of the high valuations. (I’m thinking here of the likes of Palantir and OpenAI rather than the Magnificent Seven tech giants, most of which still don’t seem truly crazily-priced given their sales growth and margins.) No, also in the way that Dotcom-era start-ups floated on an ocean of ultimately VC-funded advertising that paid the bills of a bunch of other start-ups, which ultimately took half of them down when somebody thought to ask “how many people are actually clicking on these things?” and pulled the plug when they got a straight answer. I mean, doesn’t nVidia investing in OpenAI so that OpenAI can get chips from nVidia have the whiff of that to you? Even so, you might imagine that none of this matters for your portfolio. But what if I quoted JP Morgan informing us this week that: AI related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022. This also seems like a pertinent point to remind you that US equities account for 60-70% or more of global tracker funds. Artificial Intelligence taking all the jobs or becoming super-intelligent is one thing. But this AI boom being exposed as productivity-sapping margin-crushing hype on a nation-state-GDP level would also cause us investors plenty of pain. Accordingly, I’ve been worried and underweight the US at least 18 months. And boy hasn’t it made keeping within spitting distance of the global market’s return difficult. Because once more with feeling: AI related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022. On the other hand, Wall Street’s obsession with big tech and AI has left lots of other stuff looking good value, especially outside of the US. And it’s fun to hunt around for it. The activist manager Saba, for example, is awaiting approval for a new ETF it’s launching that will enable value-minded investors to buy a basket of UK investment trusts – specifically because so many of them are still going cheap. Again, the parallels are obvious. Nobody wanted to own Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway at the peak of the Dotcom Bubble. Then in the years after the bubble bust, value soared. The set-up looks so easy, right? Yeah, too easy. We could be in 1996, say, not 1999. More importantly we’re actually in 2025, and stock market history rhymes rather than repeats. So all I’m saying for sure is that if this is a bubble and if it does burst, then you’ll hear a lot about nVidia putting $100bn into OpenAI in every future account of it. Oh, and incidentally people keep saying the hyperscalers are spending tens of billions ‘building out the AI infrastructure’ as if they were laying down concrete. But anyone who has ever bought a new nVidia graphics card to play the latest PC games will have found themselves confronted with jerky frame rates six months later. These things go stale faster than you can say “whatever happened to the Metaverse?” So if they are building out the AI infrastructure, they’re going to have to build it out again… Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. “…while half of the population live in households that get more in benefits than they pay in tax” If you choose – misleadingly, in my view – t0 categorise the State Retirement Pension as a “benefit” that result seems almost inevitable. But if you used a better definition, is it still true? Yes, with the US market dominated by a very few big companies all at high PEs and all operating in roughly the same space (or at least whose fortunes are somewhat tied to “tech”) and that US market dominating global trackers it’s very hard to feel enthusiastic or even indifferent to just adding to your global trackers holding every month no matter how much of a passive investor I want to credit myself as being (and hard to feel enthusiastic about the US anyway with His Donaldness running the show). So much so I do wonder if I should be looking at putting 50% into a global tracker and the other 50% into “other” (world ex US tracker or Europe / UK / Asia trackers as suits your prejudice). Not the first person to wonder / worry about this of course (may even be the last person to actually start to think about doing something about it!). @David 14 – I very much share your discomfort. That discomfort is amplified by being essentially at my FI number. More and more, I keep thinking of mantras like ‘be fearful when others are greedy’ and ‘if you’ve won the game then don’t swing for the fences’. It would be great to get a Monevator article about CAPE ratios, esp as it pertains to those on the cusp of FI (though not necessarily RE) Imo there is a at one level a fairly normal cyclical AI bubble that should burst but leave behind a few winners (imo Google looks good, Meta etc can keep their AI video slop). Within that you have the normal slightly dodgy behavior – and Nvidia has always funded its customers aided by its high valuation and has a few red flags running through the accounts, but in these bubbles that is normal. But if you step back with a US focus you also have imo high house prices (see UK also), incredible household debt (lesser in UK), high earnings multiples across the board in the US (opposite to UK) and a Private Equity bubble to layer in (lesser in UK). Plus whatever crypto is (lesser in UK). On Private Equity, you have the likes of HubSpot that never really have earnings but get through the PE-cycle and list to now be worth $27bn while always losing money, now as a fully mature company. That in turn creates confusion over what value is – is it earnings or revenue? And that seeps out, so you have Palantir and Tesla valued on the idea of something vague in the future. That imo is not a part of the AI bubble, but results more from the PE bubble and from the debt bubble (eventually borrowing to speculate). And it’s quite confusing having multiple bubbles in play at once. In the end it feels to me like there is a broader growing volcano fed by the belief that all this can keep expanding. But it’s hard to read because it’s like a multiheaded snake. @Andy/David : I’m also in the “if you’ve won, quit playing so much” space – have toned down equities in my portfolio. I’ve even bought a chunk of long long term index-linked gilts, which in theory provide a guaranteed over-inflation return. Somehow, with the state of the UK I can’t quite feel fully confident in that however. Whilst nothing is a crystal ball, we are at CAPE levels only seen really in the dotcom crisis. They could of course go above and beyond that in theory, but I think there’s no shame in taking this time to review whether one’s asset allocation is appropriate. @Part-Time Analyst “…is it earnings or revenue?” Did you mean “profit or revenue”? I thought earnings and revenue are the same thing. Excellent comment, by the way. Only just saw also that Jonathan Clements from Humble Dollar passed away this week too, sad news. He was an excellent writer. Expensive US markets, highly concentrated, cause concern to many investors, it has caused me to mentally flip flop from sticking to plan and becoming more cautious , with some portfolio changes made, with poor conviction if I am honest. It would be fair to say that the magnificent 7 are very expensive, the rest of the US market has an elevated CAPE ( say 33). Looking at the All World , the 40% non US holdings are probably fairly valued, CAPE about 20 , the remaining US market is 60% of the whole, is expensive with around ⅓ of that being very expensive. On aggregate The All World is expensive but does that have sufficient predicative power to be more than a little cautious ? I am reminded of the Peter Lynch quote “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.” dearieme – State Pension is a welfare benefit for almost all recipients, as their working life NI contributions fall way short of the value of the state pension they received – both in strict monetary terms, as well as the fact its zero risk, adjusted for inflation etc. @JDW — Indeed, very sad. I’ve included a few of Jonathan’s posts since he had his diagnosis but for some reason I felt uncomfortable including his final post in the links. I can’t explain exactly why… I think it was because it was written almost as a personal letter to US readers who have known him for decade, and it felt a bit inauthentic? A bit silly in retrospect if s. Here it is for those who enjoyed his writing: https://humbledollar.com/forum/farewell-friends/ @TI – thanks for adding that link to Jonathan Clements, sad news, I always enjoyed his posts. Interesting to see the back story, I hadn’t picked up that he was British. I have been underweight in US for years, even before the LLM AI appearance. I have no regrets. Even if/when this all shakes out I don’t see the need to take huge region concentration risks – if Japan was 70% of the world index, I wouldn’t be holding a single world index either, it’s not just an anti-AI protection move – at what point is a world index not diversified? ~70% in any one region must already be getting close. Although, if, like me, you are intentionally down on US but higher percentages elsewhere you probably saw fairly large japan and (asia-japan) index gains just recently. For the first time in a long time my rebalance involved selling quite a lot of japan and asia-japan. At the level of an individual investor, a 70% US weight in a world index leads to huge losses if the AI bubble bursts. Add to this political risk associated with US… Ironically, nvidia still has a good business if AI bust happens, as they were doing the exact same work/research pre-AI, just the gpu’s and underlying code was bought by end users for playing pc games instead. They will need to pay folk off and readjust back to normal growth etc, but all the efforts in improving their gpu offerings for both crypto and now AI will be just as useful in the future for what was once their core business. They aren’t holding huge inventory, so if AI goes pop they go back to putting complex mathematics in GPUs for games. Those companies that now have factories full of racks of nvidia gpus at high expense, they have real problems if AI takes a back seat. The sad thing about AI so far is if you put aside mediocre chat bots and summarising documents (with some hallucinations thrown in just to make the current output completely unusable if its important work or has accountability requirements), the only improved use case for this generation of AI is unmanned military drones etc, which is quite sad. The other uses of AI being thrown about like medical imaging and such is not new and been happening for decades, everyone is just throwing AI in to funding applications to win funding or to improve their “impact” scores. Thanks for bringing the ‘state of the rhino’ report to the attention of the readership. @TI – very timely. Last week I shuffled my defensive assets. I sold some BHMG to buy Pershing Square Holdings (I’m hoping at least one of them can repeat 2008 and hit it out of the park if SHTF). To counter the increase in US in PSH, I sold some HSBC FTSE All World and I’ll buy a All-World ex-US to keep US as is. Not very passivista, but there you go. I was a great follower of Jonathan Clements -he helped a lot of people and will be greatly missed He was of course a believer and promoter of “ indexing ” long before it became so fashionable Global indexing in equities and bonds have been a success with funding my 23 years of retirement -so far I don’t really feel any urgent need to change and certainly am constantly unable to second guess the market One global index fund for equities and bonds respectively certainly makes investing life cheap ,very easy to understand and manage Very boring of course especially if your interest is the stockmarket and its various shenanigans Some very special investors can beat the market return-sadly I realised fairly early into my investing career that I was not amongst the lucky few I suppose it was always true that only a very few companies actually move the stockmarket-5%?-also these successful companies tend to be different every year etc etc Sitting tight here xxd09 @TI: The “Millions of Americans are becoming economically invisible” Bloomberg article seems to be the antithesis of the theme of last weeks weekend reading. The picture the article paints sounds, at best, somewhat unstable to me. Any thoughts? Thanks for all the other interesting links too. Those subheadings 😉 I’m partying like it’s 1999 in my head! @Curlew – Earnings was perhaps a bit careless on my part to use as it can have a dual meaning, but I meant in terms of profits. So earnings as in the E in EBIT or EBTIDA. Now is the LLM winter of our discontent, made glorious ASI summer by this Son of Neural Nets. LLMs predict language. They don’t predict for the World. They’re the perfect info mirror. But there’s nothing new in the mirror. Just a reflection looking back at us. Without true novelty there can’t be the real breakthroughs needed for additional growth, less still a tech / econ singularity to solve the many ills ailing the world. Aside from the fundamental foundational flaw (another ’empty box’ as SBF put it for crypto), there’s also the technical barrier of current approaches: exponential increases needed for linear improvement using compute / parameter scaling. LLMs alone can’t be the solution. Maybe they are part of the solution. Maybe they’re a distraction and dead end. But investment into AGI based on LLMs alone *will* fail that objective. This emphatically doesn’t mean though that the search for AGI ends. We know it is possible empirically from nature – Darwinism produced us. We know it is possible from our well tested foundational model of physics. Generalised intelligence (and autonomous super intelligence) is/will be just emergent complexity from quarks and fields. Like everything else. In truth, all just Atoms and the Void, as Democritus put it. Echoing the caution in this thread about LLM (mis-sold as AI) driven market froth, I’ve tracked similar skepticism for the past year via 100+ comments now on Monevator’s May 2024 “First they came for the call centres” piece over here: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-first-they-came-for-the-call-centres/ TL:DR: Starting with barbell strategies tilting to momentum ETFs like SPYO for AI upside, while hedging with ex US small cap value for mean reversion, my views evolved: following LLM critics like Gary Marcus / Ed Zitron, doubting scaling to AGI, and likening it to 1990s nanotech hype constrained by physics. And in the @TI above linked “Queasy about US Valuations” piece (also 2024), this also extended to broader market unease, advocating modest shifts (e.g., 20% to bonds) for asymmetric protection, toy models show 2:1 upside/downside ratios favoring small tweaks, plus return stacking via WTEF ETF to cut S&P exposure from 65% to 42% while boosting total allocation to the equivalent of 130% with gilts and ex US equities. We need to know our history on this. It’s not just a rerun of Dot.com from 1996-99 or the Nifty Fifty from 1970-72. There’s a longer term pattern here. Natural Language Processing’s post-1958 timeline (Mark 1 Perceptron, 1st artificial neural net) amplifies the current AI winter risks: ELIZA (1966) ignited hype, but AI winters still struck hatd (1974-80, 1987-93) post-over promises. Revivals via 1980s stat based NLPs, early attempts at World models, and development of what became the Internet led to hiatus until 2010s deep learning (Word2Vec 2013), Transformers (2017), and multimodal advances (GPT-4o 2024, Grok-4 2025). Now hallucinations and inevitable near term ROI shortfalls (on the truly staggering over investment into increasingly rapidly obsolescent intensive GPU / TPU/ NPU data centre architectures) all loudly signal pending disillusionment. Yet, this trough could yet still seed ASI breakthroughs via much neglected hybrid neural symbolic approaches. Portfolio fallout? An AI winter craters Magnificent 7 like Dot.com’s 75% plunge. So I’m staying underweight US tech, diversifying globally: history cycles, rewarding patient investors eyeing the thaw. Enjoyed (if that’s the right word) the ‘who’s getting rich off your attention’ article. Great context to the broader theme of omni-slop AI content, while being suitably bleak for a grey Sunday morning. Two interesting articles in the Economist, one relevant to this. Apparently the use of AI in internet searches is destroying the value of ads on the internet (rather than going to the usual items with ads in them, internet users are going to the AI search to get their answer). If true, advertisers will surely notice and down go the huge ad revenues. Hoist by one’s own petard comes to mind. Unrelated, the Economist also did a lucid piece on a looming UK Government debt crisis. It cites Labour’s ideological unwillingness to do the one thing which can avoid the bond market making life impossible ie cutting the welfare bill (15% of working age people on benefits etc). @Hospitaller Re the Economist article: “… It cites Labour’s ideological unwillingness to do the one thing which can avoid the bond market making life impossible ie cutting the welfare bill” The article clearly stated two things not one (“…it is abundantly clear that the fiscal adjustment should start with pensions and the welfare budget.“) before expanding on these two things. The article is available at https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/09/25/britain-is-slowly-going-bust though it’s paywalled (but if you set up create a free account they let you read a few items gratis). RC #12 DH #19 – the thing is, the ability to summarise something automatically is pretty useful, summarising is probably selling the technique a little short, being able to wrangle information into the way you want to consume it is almost a superpower. The WWW provided a means to access information, through a delivery mechanism and search facility. It sounds dull but it turned out to be revolutionary. The ability to curate the worlds knowledge into a format that suits you, automagically and within seconds, to aid its consumption may well be equally revolutionary? That said, being revolutionary doesn’t preclude huge busts en-route as per 1999. The previous AI winters were really because the theory was great but none of it actually did anything useful. That isn’t now the case, we’ve seen huge step changes in performance of AI models across multiple pardigms, CV (CNNs), RNNs (inc. LLMs), RL etc. the difference being some new, novel architectures but critically, the compute to support it. Chat-bots and drones doesn’t really cover it. You don’t need AGI for all this to be game-changeingly useful. Novelty isn’t where 99.9% of the work unfolds. RC #12, Rhino #23: Current monetised LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Grok, etc) together generates in the low billions of revenue (and larger losses) annually. That’s a rounding error against even one hyperscaler’s merely current yearly Capex (~$60–100 bn). McKinsey boldly est ~$6.7 Tn data centre Capex to 2030, roughly $5.2 Tn of which targets frontier model grade compute. *If* that happens, then Nvidia likely becomes a $800-$1,100/share ($20-27 Tn cap) stock (~4-7x from now). But No Guests = No Party. Sure sunk + fully legally committed investments raise floor, as site builds already started (land, power, cooling) & multi yrs supply contracts mean they’ll be some extra capacity led min. level of additional demand persistence. However, will several trillions+ of GPU Capex actually show up in just the next few yrs? It all doesn’t add up to much unless and until enterprise + individual LLM specific profits – not revenues – are nearing $1 Tn in 2030. My sense on that number is that it’s a LoL one. And, while hyperscalers can repurpose racks from one workload to another (cloud/HPC, enterprise inference, simulation, gov/sovereign projects), all this alleged future demand ultimately depends upon LLMs being sufficiently commercially transformative (to the accounting bottom line, and not just with BS generation) that staff can be replaced at scale (many millions laid off), thereby justifying businesses spending the well over $1 Tn in 2030 (likely very substantially more) which will be necessary to generate ~$1 Tn in profits for model providers that year to keep feeding the insaitable Capex monster. Seems one hell of stretch from here just now. The only scaling I see are in OpenAI’s losses. This could be Metaverse times 100 or WeWork times 1,000. LLM’s are the reason for all the recent public AI hype and investment, and these are where most the problems lie, not AI in the general sense – every LLM tool has a disclaimer along the lines “results may be innacurate”. The most useful areas where modern inference approaches will contribute anything to society or even in business is in areas where work has been progressing for decades long before chat GPT i.e. not LLM’s. In terms of investing, the useful inference work would still be happening at maybe only a reduced rate without LLM’s – the funding and progress has increased as researchers are gaming the funding applications process by putting things under AI and with more hardware etc, so we do have some benefits, and some good research is happening. However, as someone who has formally researched in statistical inference and spent a career in the application of statistical inference, I stand by my opinion that chat GPT spurred huge investments in technology that will struggle to ever lose the disclaimers about innacuracies – to me as someone who cares about correctness, this is a problem. Whether this lack of rigour leads to stock market implosions is not something I know, but I choose where I invest my money, and the AI hype is being driven by biased, hallucinating, LLMs tools. I am not that interested to be investing in these tools despite my entire and current career being in areas concerned with the methodologies. I might be proved wrong in a decade, but that is fine, I make my money from building useful models, not from investing in inference tools that are… mostly ok, probably close to what your training data says, but might be wrong in places sometimes, give wrong sources, and plain make stuff up in others? That is my position. If chat GPT didn’t get released, the AI investments of recent years would not have happened. So the decision to invest to support it is not about general inference and AI (which has solid foundations and happening for decades), but whether you think LLM’s justify the hype. @RC #25: it’s so hard to know/guess what to do. Never bet against America says Buffett. But, the US underperformed (for example) EMs horrendously in 2000-2008. As Soros puts it (paraphrasing heavily), every bubble has a rational foundation, and an irrational response to it. Businesses will be built on, or adjacent to, LLMs, but which will reward investors? Which have even sustainable business models? Does ~50x for Nvidia make sense on a 30 year ‘risk free’ rate of 5%? Example (recalling point (6) in #88 (21 June 25) in the “First they came for the call centres” thread): when the car was first fully commercialised there were hundreds of listed manufacturers. Most went bust. But even if you’d had the luck or foresight to hold a successful one like Ford, then during 1980 to 2020 you ‘only’ made 23x. However, of all the companies out there, it was Walmart which benefited most from the car, as shoppers could visit massive suburban stores off the highway (a 1,600x return over that same period). This feels like one of the more difficult times to be an investor. Not because of deglobalisation, populist nonsense, or the sinister shadows of staflation; but owing instead to the recent, seeming emergent, exogenous shock of a ‘new’ technology which is so hyped, but still just might be a progenitor of sorts to the supposed solution of all our problems (or the harbinger of misaligned doom). Maybe diversification is the only rational response: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/09/25/history-shows-investors-that-it-pays-to-diversify/ But how much (and how to*) diversify away from the US? What is too much (or too little) risk to, in effect, ‘go short’ the US tech darlings (or at least the semis) by under weighting them vis a vie their cap weights? *Tom Stevenson has a rose tinted view of the attributes of active managed funds IMO; but for DM and EM micro and nano cap or Frontier Markets you do have to fall back on specialist ITs and open ended funds because there just aren’t passive alternatives.

The diversified fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million as of July 31, up from 723,332 shares on Apr. 30. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund increased its holdings in the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) by 38.4% during the second quarter, according to a Sept. 26 SEC filing. As of July 31, the diversified fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million, up from 723,332 shares on Apr. 30. The addition of 277,476 shares represents the fund’s return to Bitcoin allocation after reducing exposure earlier this year. Year-over-year growth demonstrates accelerating Bitcoin adoption within BlackRock’s portfolio management. The fund held just 198,874 IBIT shares as of July 31, 2024, representing a 403% increase over the previous twelve months. IBIT represents 0.4% of the Global Allocation Fund’s $17.1 billion assets under management, a 62.5% increase from the 0.25% allocation recorded in the first quarter. The current weighting marks substantial growth from the 0.1% position held in October 2024. BlackRock recommended 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a “reasonable range” in its model portfolio on Feb. 28, positioning the Global Allocation Fund below its target range. The recent increases indicate movement toward this recommended exposure level through gradual and cautious accumulation. The Global Allocation Fund invests across US and international equities, debt securities, money market instruments, and other short-term assets. Portfolio composition varies periodically in response to market conditions and investment opportunities. BlackRock launched IBIT in January 2024 as part of the first wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of Sept. 25, the fund has the largest Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $61 billion in cumulative net flows. The Global Allocation Fund’s methodical approach to Bitcoin allocation demonstrates institutional investment strategies for crypto exposure. BlackRock continues building its position toward recommended portfolio weightings while managing volatility through gradual accumulation.

Reports that a group of investors could be gearing up for a takeover bid helped drive a power-up for a major video game publisher, while soft same-store sales results in the U.S. weighed on the stock of a membership warehouse club. Major U.S. equities indexes broke their three-day losing streak as a key inflation gauge was in line with expectations, which could keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates further. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, the Dow was up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.4% higher. Click here to find more coverage from Investopedia of the day's market news. Shares of video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) surged nearly 15%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after a report that a deal could be in the works to take the company private. According to The Wall Street Journal, a group of investors that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the private equity firm Silver Lake could be nearing a $50 billion transaction—potentially the largest leveraged buyout of all time—to take over the game publisher known for its sports titles. President Donald Trump announced a new set of tariffs Thursday, including levies on imports of pharmaceuticals, certain types of furniture, and heavy-duty trucks. Shares of Paccar (PCAR), parent company of the Peterbilt and Kenworth truck brands, gaining over 5%. The company had previously indicated that tariff-related uncertainty was weighing on the truck market, with U.S. truck manufacturers also managing the impact of tariffs on key components like steel and aluminum. Intel (INTC) shares extended their recent rally, adding 4.4% Friday. The Wall Street Journal indicated that, in addition to talks with Apple (AAPL), Intel has approached TSMC (TSM) about potential investment and partnership opportunities. Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest company by market capitalization, announced a $5 billion investment and collaboration plan with Intel last week. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.6% after the Federal Aviation Administration said the plane maker will be allowed to issue airworthiness certificates on some of its 737 Max and 787 jets. The eased restrictions, which enable the company to conduct the final safety check on certain aircraft, could help Boeing accelerate production and delivery schedules. In addition, Turkish Airlines finalized a deal to purchase 225 Boeing planes following Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit to the U.S. this week. Costco (COST) stock slid nearly 3% after the members-only warehouse giant reported its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. Sales and profits topped analysts' expectations, but U.S. same-store sales fell slightly short of estimates. While shoppers may be drawn to Costco's bargains on essential items amid economic uncertainty and concerns about inflation, the company said consumers remain cautious about discretionary purchases and pointed to intensifying competition in the space. Oracle (ORCL) shares fell 2.7% Friday, extending declines posted in the prior session after Rothschild Redburn initiated coverage of the stock with a "sell" rating. Analysts cautioned that markets may be overly optimistic in their lofty expectations for the software provider's cloud operations. Shares of online auction platform operator eBay (EBAY) slipped about 2%. The stock had notched strong gains after the e-commerce company posted better-than-expected revenue, adjusted earnings, and gross merchandise volume in its latest earnings report released at the end of July. EBay said this week that it agreed to purchase Norway-based consumer-to-consumer social marketplace Tise.

Title: ‘South Park’: A guide to every Trump-era parody in Season 27 (so far)
URL: https://www.denverpost.com/2025/09/26/south-park-guide/
Time Published: 2025-09-26T18:03:28Z
Full Content:
Kaitlyn Huamani, Los Angeles Times Every episode of “South Park” opens with a disclaimer: “All characters and events in this show — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.” While some of that language must be required by an exhausted legal team behind the scenes, the long-running satirical cartoon is known for pressing hot-button topics and rapidly churning out searing parodies. Season 27, which premiered in July, is no exception, focusing on President Donald Trump, his associates, policies and other current events. Some members of Trump’s Cabinet have been outspoken about their likeness appearing in “South Park,” but others have shrugged it off. Over the years, the animated series has depicted conservatives and liberals alike, leaving almost no public figure, politician or activist shielded from critique or crude depiction. ‘South Park’ lays into FCC chair over freedom of speech in new episode This season has had an unusual cadence of episodes, with the first two arriving on a weekly schedule, then biweekly before the arrival of Episode 5, which aired three weeks later on Wednesday. The delayed episode arrived after the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose debate style was depicted in the Episode 2. However, “South Park” creators Matt Parker and Trey Stone told the Denver Post the delay was unrelated to recent events, like Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, or the content: “No one pulled the episode, no one censored us, and you know we’d say so if true.” The pair had issued a statement on Sept. 17 saying the episode wasn’t finished in time. Future episodes will air every two weeks through Dec. 10. Here is a guide to every parody and reference so far on this season of “South Park.” Cartman is dismayed to find out National Public Radio has lost its federal funding after he tunes in to hear static — an NPR program is his “favorite show,” he says, where “all the liberals b— and whine about stuff.” He rants to his friends about how the government “can’t cancel a show” and wonders what might be next on the chopping block. In July, the Senate voted to approve the Trump White House’s proposal to claw back roughly $1 billion in federal funding previously allocated for public broadcasting. NPR and PBS are still operating despite the funding cuts, but layoffs and reduced programming are expected. Head of South Park Elementary PC Principal, whose name was a play on the initialism for politically correct, announces to the school that his name now stands for “Power Christian Principal.” He holds an assembly where he says that “our Lord and savior Jesus Christ” is the only thing that can bring back some normalcy to these “corrupt times.” He proceeds to welcome Jesus to the assembly as a guest speaker. When the students go back home, their parents and the people of South Park are alarmed to hear about the emphasis on Christianity — and the presence of Jesus — in the town’s public school. Trump has previously endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms amid a push to incorporate more Christianity into public schools. The phrase frequently used by Trump was inscribed on a T-shirt Cartman wears after he realizes the concept of “wokeness” is no longer prominent. “Everyone hates the Jews, everyone’s fine with using gay slurs,” he says, lamenting that he no longer feels purpose if there’s no wokeness to contest. The White House press secretary is depicted corralling the president, sporting a large cross necklace, as she often does during press briefings. Leavitt tells Trump a lot of his supporters are starting to turn against him and begs him to talk to them, adding that they’re “really riled up.” Trump’s base has expressed frustration over the administration’s approach to sharing information about the Jeffery Epstein case after he promised more transparency about the convicted sex offender, who died by suicide in 2019, and the sex trafficking investigation involving the late financier. Trump appears this season with an image of his face over an animated body, frequently repeating the phrase “Relax, guy” and threatening lawsuits against anyone who’s in his way. He is shown berating a White House portrait painter for an unflattering depiction of him and there are references to the size of the president’s genitalia. He’s also depicted as being in an abusive relationship with Satan — in which Trump is the abuser. “South Park” has previously depicted Satan as being the victim in an abusive relationship with Saddam Hussein. Satan laments the speculation that Trump’s name is on the “Epstein list,” a purported list of his alleged clients. In reality, the Justice Department has said no such list exists, walking back comments Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi made in a Fox News interview earlier this year that the list was “sitting on my desk” in preparation for release. When the list is brought up in the series, fictional Trump says, “Are we still talking about that?,” mirroring comments he made in real life. The stopwatch featured in the introduction to “60 Minutes” is strapped to a bomb when it appears on “South Park.” The hosts of the show are visibly nervous and continue praising the president while covering his lawsuit against the town of South Park, adding that they don’t agree with Trump’s detractors. The scene references the legal tussle between Trump and Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which airs “60 Minutes.” The president sued over edits to a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which led to Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July; shortly after, the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance. Between the settlement and merger approval, CBS announced it is canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Colbert frequently skewers the president on his show, and Trump praised the cancellation. Paramount also recently bought the global streaming rights to “South Park” in a lucrative $1.5 billion deal for Parker and Stone. During the episode’s fictitious “60 Minutes” segment over Trump’s lawsuit against the town, Jesus comes to visit the townspeople. Through whispers, he tells them, “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.” “The president’s suing you?” a protester asks. Jesus, through clenched teeth, explains: “The guy can do what he wants now that someone backed down. … You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys gotta stop being stupid. … If someone has the power of the presidency and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone.” “All of you, shut the f— up or South Park is over!” Jesus says. The people of South Park end up settling their lawsuit with the president for $3.5 million, saying it will be fine as long as they cut some funding for their schools, hospitals and roads. And as part of the settlement, they have to agree to “pro-Trump messaging.” Cut to a live-action deepfake video of Trump trekking through the desert in a show of loyalty to his supporters before he strips naked. [Note: This episode aired on Aug. 6, more than a month before political commentator Charlie Kirk, who is parodied throughout the episode, was shot and killed.] This episode is focused on the ongoing raids carried out across the country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security officials since earlier this year. When South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackey is fired — the government is doing away with needless spending in schools, he’s told — he signs up for a job with ICE, enticed by a generous signing bonus and a higher salary. Mackey watches a promotional video, complete with animations of officers wearing gaiters and a theme song: “We don’t ask for experience, just show up/ We don’t care if you’ve read a book or grown up/ If you’re crazy or fat and lazy, we don’t care at all … If you need a job, it’s a job to have.” Mackey is hired with alarming speed and proceeds to go on his first raid, targeting a “Dora the Explorer” live show, which has a not-so-intimidating audience of young children and abuelitas. After ICE agents hear from protesters that there are “many Latinos in heaven,” they make the pearly gates their next stop. The Department of Homeland Security secretary leads ICE agents through a series of raids this episode, but she first appears in an orientation video. She tells the new recruits, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face because sometimes doing what’s important means doing what’s hard,” and she proceeds to going on a shooting spree targeting yelping puppies (including Krypto the Superdog) throughout the episode. In her 2024 book, Noem wrote about how she killed her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior. She’s also seen rounding up as many immigrants as possible in raids, shouting orders like, “If it’s brown, it goes down.” And in a running gag, her face periodically melts off, requiring a glam squad equivalent to a pit crew, and at one point, it seems to take on a life of its own. Trump also says her face “freaks me out” during the episode. Noem responded to the depiction on Glenn Beck’s podcast, calling it “lazy” to target her looks. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can’t, they just pick something petty like that,” she said. While conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk does not appear as a character in this episode, his style of debate content — and his name — are featured. Loudmouthed Cartman is frustrated that so many others, namely his classmate Clyde Donovan, are profiting off of “his shtick” of arguing against liberal views. Clyde has a debate podcast, inviting viewers to watch as he “totally destroys these woke liberal students.” He’s set up in a tent on a college campus where he waits as a line of students come to speak with him, and he challenges them to “prove me wrong.” Cartman eventually takes over, saying that he is the “master debater” and sporting a haircut similar to Kirk’s. He shuts down his opponents’ arguments with phrases like, “You just hate America and you love abortions.” Clyde and Cartman’s content replicates Kirk’s well-known style. The founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA frequently toured college campuses and hosted events just like the one depicted in the episode. The phrase “prove me wrong” was used frequently by Kirk to promote his events, inviting students to challenge his political and cultural views. On Sept. 10, Kirk was shot and killed while hosting such an event at Utah Valley University, the first stop of his “American Comeback” tour. Weeks before he was killed, Kirk responded to the episode with a 30-minute YouTube video, finding it humorous. “I think a lot of it was hilarious towards me,” he said. “Some of it was very funny and I don’t think we should have too thick of skin.” He also touched on the reach of his organization and events, noting that his name is enshrined in “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters” that Cartman and Clyde compete for in the episode. “So a campus thing I’ve been doing for 13 years to debate random college kids has now been so important that it gets prominent prime-time placement on Comedy Central?” he asked through laughs. “I think the whole thing is just awesome and hilarious.” When Mr. Mackey is rewarded for good work as an ICE agent, he’s flown to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he frequently stays and hosts events. He’s greeted by giggling women who hand him a drink and put flower leis around his neck before the president meets him and gives him a brief tour of Mar-a-Lago. While there, Mackey accidentally walks in on two older men receiving massages from younger women, one of whom is a tearful Dora, detained in the raid that took place earlier in the episode. The scene is likely a reference to Epstein and accounts from survivors who say they were forced to give massages to him and his associates. Trump said this summer that Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa, which caused them to have a falling-out. The vice president is depicted as a version of Tattoo, the character from late-’70s drama “Fantasy Island,” and is animated similarly as Trump, except the photo used for his face is lifted directly from viral memes. He often does the president’s bidding, calling him “boss.” In turn, Trump frequently calls Vance “stupid.” Acknowledging the caricature, Vance wrote on X, “Well, I’ve finally made it.” Randy’s hemp farm business, Tegridy Farms, is the site of an immigration raid at the the beginning of this episode. While Randy is shooting a commercial, complete with calming guitar music and a trite script, ICE officers interrupt by detaining almost all the workers. “You sons of b—,” Randy screams after the vans as they drive away. “Those are my Mexicans!” In July, chaotic raids targeting a cannabis company’s growing site and greenhouse in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties drew national attention after a man who was fleeing immigration officials died. With his business in shambles, Randy rethinks his strategy with the help of an over-complimentary AI chatbot. Perhaps in a nod to Trump’s former ally and onetime “special government employee” Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and X, Randy turns to ketamine. Randy insists a slew of “tech guys” are taking small doses of ketamine and the drug “gives their minds the edge to work with AI.” Ketamine “bolsters our focus and creativity,” he tells his partner Towelie. Under the influence of the drug, Randy transforms Tegridy Farms from a “quaint farm” into an “AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.” Musk’s use of ketamine and other drugs has been previously reported, with the tech leader saying in a 2024 interview that ketamine has been prescribed to him and is “helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.” He has denied abusing it. “If you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days,” he said. “So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.” Musk supported Trump’s campaign and served as an advisor to the president, helming the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year with the goal of slashing spending. Meta and Apple chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, who were both present at Trump’s inauguration and have maintained friendly relationships with him, are both portrayed in this episode as members of a long line outside of the Oval Office waiting to bestow a gift on the president. “Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative,” Cook says to Trump. Cook gives the president a gift on behalf of Apple, which actually happened this summer. Zuckerberg is later seen giving the president a gift that appears to be a gold and bejeweled Meta virtual reality headset. Qatar’s leader is also seen in line holding a model gold plane with a tag that says “Air Force One.” Like everyone else, the leader compliments the president and insists his genitalia is not small before giving him the gift. Trump and the Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747 aircraft from Qatar for President Trump to use as Air Force One this summer, despite ongoing questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation. When Towelie takes a trip to the capital in this episode, he sees armed troops guarding monuments like the Washington and Lincoln memorials and the Capitol surrounded by tanks and jets. In the episode, the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced by a statue of a stern-faced Trump with exposed genitalia. In August, Trump called up National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to “reestablish law and order” by targeting criminals — though crime has been down in the city — and the homeless. Although troops were not initially armed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later ordered them to carry service-issued weapons. Randy sends Towelie to meet with Trump and give him a gift in hopes of persuading him to reclassify marijuana on the national level. (The gift is Towelie himself.) Randy, in the form of a hologram, tells Trump he thinks they can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement. Trump said in an August press conference that his administration was considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, which would be a significant change in policy but would not make the drug legal across the country. The clerk at the City Pop-Up — rebranded from City Wok — the lone purveyor of Labubus in the area, says the popular dolls are hard to keep in stock, and they’re very expensive because of tariffs. The “mystery box” that Butters has to purchase for the chance of getting the exact Labubu his girlfriend wants sets him back $85, and later, the price shoots up to $120 to offset a rise in tariffs. (The real-life dolls often fetch much more than that on resale sites, especially if they are rare.) When Butters balks at the price, the store owner explains that the cost of tariffs is passed onto the customer. This episode shows a clip from a Fox News segment where an anchor is overly complimentary of the president. The anchor says the president will take questions from a “diverse crowd of reporters” after returning to the U.S. from a historic tariff summit, only to reveal all of the reporters are from Fox. The Fox News reporters also fixate on President Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania, and his increasingly frequent appearances with Satan. There’s a heavy use of wordplay that suggests the anchors could be asking about the affair between the president and Satan or about whether Trump is actually the devil himself. Fox News reporters check in with Trump ally Kid Rock after breaking the news that — buckle up — Trump has impregnated Satan. A sobbing Kid Rock tells the reporters, “I’m just so happy.” The musician is a friend and ardent supporter of Trump, having performed at his inaugural rally in January and spoken many times publicly about his support of the president. Kyle becomes irate when his classmates place bets on a popular market prediction app that his mother would “strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital.” This episode marks the first time this season that the show has touched on the current conflict in Gaza, and it referenced real-life Israeli strikes on hospitals in the area. Trump’s eldest son appears in this episode as someone with many roles — he’s a strategic adviser for predictive markets, he answers the phone for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and also acts as a special adviser to Israel. Although he wears all those hats, the series doesn’t portray him as particularly bright — he has a complete conversation over the phone with himself. He’s also animated to look as if he’s had extensive plastic surgery and he speaks with a strained voice, as if he can’t move his face. Trump Jr. holds several key roles in his family’s business and his father’s political sphere in real life, and he serves as an adviser to both Polymart and Kalshi, two prediction market apps that are named and spoofed in this episode. Less keen on the baby he’s expecting with Satan, Trump looks for different ways to harm the pregnancy in hopes of terminating it. He asks Satan if he wants to smoke and hang out in a hot tub, holds up a wire hanger, tries to get him to trip down the stairs or fall under a pile of cat feces, and even makes Satan a soup full of emergency contraceptive pills. In reality, Trump has repeatedly shifted his messaging on abortion but has most recently said he believes specific abortion policies and access should be decided not by federal law but by individual states. The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission comes into the fold this episode when Kyle goes through several hoops to try to file a complaint over the bet involving his mom, which he finds offensive. The FCC is “dealing with all the offensive stuff now,” Kyle is told. Carr says he needs to speak with the president after learning about the offensive content, but he ends up falling victim to all of Trump’s antics in his attempt to terminate Satan’s pregnancy, which send him to the hospital. The doctors say they’re “afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.” Vance later threatens Carr, who keeps interfering with Trump’s attempts to end Satan’s pregnancy (Vance doesn’t want anything to mess with his proximity to the presidency). “We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way,” Vance says to Carr. Those words match the phrase Carr said in real life a week before this episode aired in reference to his call on ABC to act on comments late-night host Jimmy Kimmel made about Kirk’s suspected killer and his death. Carr has remained in the headlines since then as backlash grew against the FCC’s role in Kimmel’s suspension. Frustrated by the bet about her and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Kyle’s mom storms into the office of the Israeli prime minister. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?” she says. “You’re making life for Jews miserable and life for American Jews impossible.” She continues to berate him and a group of officials while the credits roll. Netanyahu does not say anything in response. ©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: ‘South Park’: A guide to every Trump-era parody in Season 27 (so far)
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/26/south-park-guide/
Time Published: 2025-09-26T18:03:28Z
Full Content:
Kaitlyn Huamani, Los Angeles Times Every episode of “South Park” opens with a disclaimer: “All characters and events in this show — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.” While some of that language must be required by an exhausted legal team behind the scenes, the long-running satirical cartoon is known for pressing hot-button topics and rapidly churning out searing parodies. Season 27, which premiered in July, is no exception, focusing on President Donald Trump, his associates, policies and other current events. Some members of Trump’s Cabinet have been outspoken about their likeness appearing in “South Park,” but others have shrugged it off. Over the years, the animated series has depicted conservatives and liberals alike, leaving almost no public figure, politician or activist shielded from critique or crude depiction. This season has had an unusual cadence of episodes, with the first two arriving on a weekly schedule, then biweekly before the arrival of Episode 5, which aired three weeks later on Wednesday. The delayed episode arrived after the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose debate style was depicted in the Episode 2. However, “South Park” creators Matt Parker and Trey Stone told the Denver Post the delay was unrelated to recent events, like Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, or the content: “No one pulled the episode, no one censored us, and you know we’d say so if true.” The pair had issued a statement on Sept. 17 saying the episode wasn’t finished in time. Future episodes will air every two weeks through Dec. 10. Here is a guide to every parody and reference so far on this season of “South Park.” Cartman is dismayed to find out National Public Radio has lost its federal funding after he tunes in to hear static — an NPR program is his “favorite show,” he says, where “all the liberals b— and whine about stuff.” He rants to his friends about how the government “can’t cancel a show” and wonders what might be next on the chopping block. In July, the Senate voted to approve the Trump White House’s proposal to claw back roughly $1 billion in federal funding previously allocated for public broadcasting. NPR and PBS are still operating despite the funding cuts, but layoffs and reduced programming are expected. Head of South Park Elementary PC Principal, whose name was a play on the initialism for politically correct, announces to the school that his name now stands for “Power Christian Principal.” He holds an assembly where he says that “our Lord and savior Jesus Christ” is the only thing that can bring back some normalcy to these “corrupt times.” He proceeds to welcome Jesus to the assembly as a guest speaker. When the students go back home, their parents and the people of South Park are alarmed to hear about the emphasis on Christianity — and the presence of Jesus — in the town’s public school. Trump has previously endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms amid a push to incorporate more Christianity into public schools. The phrase frequently used by Trump was inscribed on a T-shirt Cartman wears after he realizes the concept of “wokeness” is no longer prominent. “Everyone hates the Jews, everyone’s fine with using gay slurs,” he says, lamenting that he no longer feels purpose if there’s no wokeness to contest. The White House press secretary is depicted corralling the president, sporting a large cross necklace, as she often does during press briefings. Leavitt tells Trump a lot of his supporters are starting to turn against him and begs him to talk to them, adding that they’re “really riled up.” Trump’s base has expressed frustration over the administration’s approach to sharing information about the Jeffery Epstein case after he promised more transparency about the convicted sex offender, who died by suicide in 2019, and the sex trafficking investigation involving the late financier. Trump appears this season with an image of his face over an animated body, frequently repeating the phrase “Relax, guy” and threatening lawsuits against anyone who’s in his way. He is shown berating a White House portrait painter for an unflattering depiction of him and there are references to the size of the president’s genitalia. He’s also depicted as being in an abusive relationship with Satan — in which Trump is the abuser. “South Park” has previously depicted Satan as being the victim in an abusive relationship with Saddam Hussein. Satan laments the speculation that Trump’s name is on the “Epstein list,” a purported list of his alleged clients. In reality, the Justice Department has said no such list exists, walking back comments Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi made in a Fox News interview earlier this year that the list was “sitting on my desk” in preparation for release. When the list is brought up in the series, fictional Trump says, “Are we still talking about that?,” mirroring comments he made in real life. The stopwatch featured in the introduction to “60 Minutes” is strapped to a bomb when it appears on “South Park.” The hosts of the show are visibly nervous and continue praising the president while covering his lawsuit against the town of South Park, adding that they don’t agree with Trump’s detractors. The scene references the legal tussle between Trump and Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which airs “60 Minutes.” The president sued over edits to a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which led to Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July; shortly after, the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance. Between the settlement and merger approval, CBS announced it is canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Colbert frequently skewers the president on his show, and Trump praised the cancellation. Paramount also recently bought the global streaming rights to “South Park” in a lucrative $1.5 billion deal for Parker and Stone. During the episode’s fictitious “60 Minutes” segment over Trump’s lawsuit against the town, Jesus comes to visit the townspeople. Through whispers, he tells them, “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.” “The president’s suing you?” a protester asks. Jesus, through clenched teeth, explains: “The guy can do what he wants now that someone backed down. … You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys gotta stop being stupid. … If someone has the power of the presidency and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone.” “All of you, shut the f— up or South Park is over!” Jesus says. The people of South Park end up settling their lawsuit with the president for $3.5 million, saying it will be fine as long as they cut some funding for their schools, hospitals and roads. And as part of the settlement, they have to agree to “pro-Trump messaging.” Cut to a live-action deepfake video of Trump trekking through the desert in a show of loyalty to his supporters before he strips naked. [Note: This episode aired on Aug. 6, more than a month before political commentator Charlie Kirk, who is parodied throughout the episode, was shot and killed.] This episode is focused on the ongoing raids carried out across the country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security officials since earlier this year. When South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackey is fired — the government is doing away with needless spending in schools, he’s told — he signs up for a job with ICE, enticed by a generous signing bonus and a higher salary. Mackey watches a promotional video, complete with animations of officers wearing gaiters and a theme song: “We don’t ask for experience, just show up/ We don’t care if you’ve read a book or grown up/ If you’re crazy or fat and lazy, we don’t care at all … If you need a job, it’s a job to have.” Mackey is hired with alarming speed and proceeds to go on his first raid, targeting a “Dora the Explorer” live show, which has a not-so-intimidating audience of young children and abuelitas. After ICE agents hear from protesters that there are “many Latinos in heaven,” they make the pearly gates their next stop. The Department of Homeland Security secretary leads ICE agents through a series of raids this episode, but she first appears in an orientation video. She tells the new recruits, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face because sometimes doing what’s important means doing what’s hard,” and she proceeds to going on a shooting spree targeting yelping puppies (including Krypto the Superdog) throughout the episode. In her 2024 book, Noem wrote about how she killed her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior. She’s also seen rounding up as many immigrants as possible in raids, shouting orders like, “If it’s brown, it goes down.” And in a running gag, her face periodically melts off, requiring a glam squad equivalent to a pit crew, and at one point, it seems to take on a life of its own. Trump also says her face “freaks me out” during the episode. Noem responded to the depiction on Glenn Beck’s podcast, calling it “lazy” to target her looks. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can’t, they just pick something petty like that,” she said. While conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk does not appear as a character in this episode, his style of debate content — and his name — are featured. Loudmouthed Cartman is frustrated that so many others, namely his classmate Clyde Donovan, are profiting off of “his shtick” of arguing against liberal views. Clyde has a debate podcast, inviting viewers to watch as he “totally destroys these woke liberal students.” He’s set up in a tent on a college campus where he waits as a line of students come to speak with him, and he challenges them to “prove me wrong.” Cartman eventually takes over, saying that he is the “master debater” and sporting a haircut similar to Kirk’s. He shuts down his opponents’ arguments with phrases like, “You just hate America and you love abortions.” Clyde and Cartman’s content replicates Kirk’s well-known style. The founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA frequently toured college campuses and hosted events just like the one depicted in the episode. The phrase “prove me wrong” was used frequently by Kirk to promote his events, inviting students to challenge his political and cultural views. On Sept. 10, Kirk was shot and killed while hosting such an event at Utah Valley University, the first stop of his “American Comeback” tour. Weeks before he was killed, Kirk responded to the episode with a 30-minute YouTube video, finding it humorous. “I think a lot of it was hilarious towards me,” he said. “Some of it was very funny and I don’t think we should have too thick of skin.” He also touched on the reach of his organization and events, noting that his name is enshrined in “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters” that Cartman and Clyde compete for in the episode. “So a campus thing I’ve been doing for 13 years to debate random college kids has now been so important that it gets prominent prime-time placement on Comedy Central?” he asked through laughs. “I think the whole thing is just awesome and hilarious.” When Mr. Mackey is rewarded for good work as an ICE agent, he’s flown to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he frequently stays and hosts events. He’s greeted by giggling women who hand him a drink and put flower leis around his neck before the president meets him and gives him a brief tour of Mar-a-Lago. While there, Mackey accidentally walks in on two older men receiving massages from younger women, one of whom is a tearful Dora, detained in the raid that took place earlier in the episode. The scene is likely a reference to Epstein and accounts from survivors who say they were forced to give massages to him and his associates. Trump said this summer that Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa, which caused them to have a falling-out. The vice president is depicted as a version of Tattoo, the character from late-’70s drama “Fantasy Island,” and is animated similarly as Trump, except the photo used for his face is lifted directly from viral memes. He often does the president’s bidding, calling him “boss.” In turn, Trump frequently calls Vance “stupid.” Acknowledging the caricature, Vance wrote on X, “Well, I’ve finally made it.” Randy’s hemp farm business, Tegridy Farms, is the site of an immigration raid at the the beginning of this episode. While Randy is shooting a commercial, complete with calming guitar music and a trite script, ICE officers interrupt by detaining almost all the workers. “You sons of b—,” Randy screams after the vans as they drive away. “Those are my Mexicans!” In July, chaotic raids targeting a cannabis company’s growing site and greenhouse in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties drew national attention after a man who was fleeing immigration officials died. With his business in shambles, Randy rethinks his strategy with the help of an over-complimentary AI chatbot. Perhaps in a nod to Trump’s former ally and onetime “special government employee” Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and X, Randy turns to ketamine. Randy insists a slew of “tech guys” are taking small doses of ketamine and the drug “gives their minds the edge to work with AI.” Ketamine “bolsters our focus and creativity,” he tells his partner Towelie. Under the influence of the drug, Randy transforms Tegridy Farms from a “quaint farm” into an “AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.” Musk’s use of ketamine and other drugs has been previously reported, with the tech leader saying in a 2024 interview that ketamine has been prescribed to him and is “helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.” He has denied abusing it. “If you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days,” he said. “So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.” Musk supported Trump’s campaign and served as an advisor to the president, helming the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year with the goal of slashing spending. Meta and Apple chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, who were both present at Trump’s inauguration and have maintained friendly relationships with him, are both portrayed in this episode as members of a long line outside of the Oval Office waiting to bestow a gift on the president. “Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative,” Cook says to Trump. Cook gives the president a gift on behalf of Apple, which actually happened this summer. Zuckerberg is later seen giving the president a gift that appears to be a gold and bejeweled Meta virtual reality headset. Qatar’s leader is also seen in line holding a model gold plane with a tag that says “Air Force One.” Like everyone else, the leader compliments the president and insists his genitalia is not small before giving him the gift. Trump and the Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747 aircraft from Qatar for President Trump to use as Air Force One this summer, despite ongoing questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation. When Towelie takes a trip to the capital in this episode, he sees armed troops guarding monuments like the Washington and Lincoln memorials and the Capitol surrounded by tanks and jets. In the episode, the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced by a statue of a stern-faced Trump with exposed genitalia. In August, Trump called up National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to “reestablish law and order” by targeting criminals — though crime has been down in the city — and the homeless. Although troops were not initially armed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later ordered them to carry service-issued weapons. Randy sends Towelie to meet with Trump and give him a gift in hopes of persuading him to reclassify marijuana on the national level. (The gift is Towelie himself.) Randy, in the form of a hologram, tells Trump he thinks they can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement. Trump said in an August press conference that his administration was considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, which would be a significant change in policy but would not make the drug legal across the country. The clerk at the City Pop-Up — rebranded from City Wok — the lone purveyor of Labubus in the area, says the popular dolls are hard to keep in stock, and they’re very expensive because of tariffs. The “mystery box” that Butters has to purchase for the chance of getting the exact Labubu his girlfriend wants sets him back $85, and later, the price shoots up to $120 to offset a rise in tariffs. (The real-life dolls often fetch much more than that on resale sites, especially if they are rare.) When Butters balks at the price, the store owner explains that the cost of tariffs is passed onto the customer. This episode shows a clip from a Fox News segment where an anchor is overly complimentary of the president. The anchor says the president will take questions from a “diverse crowd of reporters” after returning to the U.S. from a historic tariff summit, only to reveal all of the reporters are from Fox. The Fox News reporters also fixate on President Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania, and his increasingly frequent appearances with Satan. There’s a heavy use of wordplay that suggests the anchors could be asking about the affair between the president and Satan or about whether Trump is actually the devil himself. Fox News reporters check in with Trump ally Kid Rock after breaking the news that — buckle up — Trump has impregnated Satan. A sobbing Kid Rock tells the reporters, “I’m just so happy.” The musician is a friend and ardent supporter of Trump, having performed at his inaugural rally in January and spoken many times publicly about his support of the president. Kyle becomes irate when his classmates place bets on a popular market prediction app that his mother would “strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital.” This episode marks the first time this season that the show has touched on the current conflict in Gaza, and it referenced real-life Israeli strikes on hospitals in the area. Trump’s eldest son appears in this episode as someone with many roles — he’s a strategic adviser for predictive markets, he answers the phone for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and also acts as a special adviser to Israel. Although he wears all those hats, the series doesn’t portray him as particularly bright — he has a complete conversation over the phone with himself. He’s also animated to look as if he’s had extensive plastic surgery and he speaks with a strained voice, as if he can’t move his face.

The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission comes into the fold this episode when Kyle goes through several hoops to try to file a complaint over the bet involving his mom, which he finds offensive.

Carr has remained in the headlines since then as backlash grew against the FCC’s role in Kimmel’s suspension. Frustrated by the bet about her and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Kyle’s mom storms into the office of the Israeli prime minister. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?” she says. “You’re making life for Jews miserable and life for American Jews impossible.” She continues to berate him and a group of officials while the credits roll.

David Senra: Brad Jacobs is, I think, the only person in history to start eight separate billion dollar companies. A lot of people on the West Coast, they don’t really know who he is because he’s just been an East Coast guy his whole life, but he started his first company when he was like 23. He’s 68 years old. He’s by far the most energetic person I have ever been around and he wrote this book called How to Make a Few Billion Dollars. Tim Ferriss: What are some of his companies with? What industries and so on? David Senra: He’s like the roll-up king. He’d roll up logistics companies and trucking companies and now he’s got a massive one that he just took public that’s doing building supplies. Early in your career you might roll up a $5 million company or a $20 million company. His first acquisition I think was like $9 billion. He just gets progressively bigger and bigger and bigger. What I find interesting about him is usually when you study extreme winners, and he’s obviously an extreme winner, what motivates them is kind of dark like issues with their father, some kind of insecurity, never felt good enough. They grew up poor and they felt they were born in the wrong place. Brad does it out of love. He’s got no negativity. He’s just a very special human being and the fact that I get to text him and call him and go to his house is insane. He’s just an amazing human being.Tim Ferriss: There’s another legend who defeated roulette and then went on to beat the market, Ed Thorp, probably another exception where — David Senra: The exception. Tim Ferriss: The exception where he did not eviscerate his personal life in the quest for business mastery. David Senra: I don’t think anybody’s mastered life clearly as much as Ed Thorp did. Your two interviews that you did with him were incredible. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. That was such a moment of gratitude to have the chance to interview him, especially because he is so, so sharp at his age. I can’t recall his exact age right now. David Senra: It’s like 89 or something like that. Tim Ferriss: If you want a holistic figure to consider emulating, Ed Thorp would be on a very, very, very short list. David Senra: I can think of three out of 400. Tim Ferriss: Who are the three? David Senra: Ed Thorp is at the top. Sol Price who’s the one that invented essentially the warehouse model like Costco, Jim Sinegal was mentored by Sol Price when Jim Sinegal was 18. Jim Sinegal, founder of Costco, built one of the greatest companies in history and he has this great line in Sol Price’s autobiography. Sol Price’s son wrote his biography. People are like, when Sol died, like, “You must have learned a lot from Sol.” He goes, “No, I didn’t learn a lot. I learned everything. Everything that I know I learned from this guy.” Sol Price, same thing, good husband, good father, didn’t chase after more money at the expense of other areas of his life after he already had enough money. Ed Thorp turned down so much, hundreds of millions, if not billions. He could have collected. He was just like, “I already have more money than I can ever spend. Why would I do that?” Then, I would say Brunello Cucinelli. Tim Ferriss: How are those examples different? You should explain for folks. I mean, look, everything I’m wearing I got for free. You should explain to people. I did not know the last name you mentioned until a few years ago because I won’t doxx him, but my friend Tony is basically covered in Brunello. Who is this? David Senra: Brunello Cucinelli wrote this, I don’t even know the name. I read the book. It’s like it’s something about Solomeo. Essentially, he sells $5,000 sweaters. He sells sweaters that were more than my first car, but he grew up in very rural Italy. Then, everybody at the time, there was just essentially the hollowing out of his community. Everybody had moved to the cities. He is a very soulful dude.Brunello essentially works. He essentially bounds his life where it’s like you work 9:00 to 5:00. You are not allowed to send an email to the company after 5:00. You have to take a break for lunch and they have this great Italian food. Then, he spends his nights reading and then going on long walks and then sitting in the cafes in this little town that he essentially rebuilt and reinvested in. He likes having cappuccino and debating philosophy. He’s just like a real soulful dude. Now the one criticism people have is like that business model works when you have 70 percent margins and your sweaters are as much as a Honda Civic, but it was very intentional. I don’t care what people do. It’s very intentional.Tim Ferriss:Let me come back to this question of clean fuel versus let’s call it dirty fuel and there’s a lot in between. I don’t want to look at it in a totally binary way, but why do you think of the say 400 plus that you can only call to mind three or four, Ed Thorp, Sol Price, Brunello Cucinelli, Brad Jacobs? Why are there so few who seem driven in that particular, let’s just call it positive way, or that they can pursue business excellence without having a lot of collateral damage in their personal lives? What do you draw from that? Look, maybe these are just different animals and out of the box these four are just fundamentally different from the other 396 or so, but what is your take on that thin slice of the total? David Senra: I would add another one to the list. You’ve also interviewed him, Michael Dell. Recently, I’ve spent hours and hours with him. We had a five hour dinner and then I just recorded a two and a half hour conversation with him for the new show. He is in love. His is very positive. Now he has a big fear of failure, which almost I think me and you probably share this. I won’t speak for you. I want to ask you actually. I am way more afraid of failure than I love winning. Tim Ferriss: I mean that’s true for everyone I know who wins a lot. I don’t think I can think of a single exception in terms of someone who celebrates the wins as much as they punish themselves for the losses. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, I’m just saying that’s pattern matching. David Senra: Even now with all the success that you’ve had, is your inner monologue still negative? Tim Ferriss: I mean there’s a lot of negative. I’m working on that. I look at some of the, I don’t want to call them maxims, but you’ve quoted the, I think it was the founder of the Four Seasons, David Senra: Excellence is the capacity to take pain. Tim Ferriss: Right, and there may be some truth to that, but I feel like it’s very risky for me to take something like that and wear it as a marching order for life because I already tilt in that direction and not all pain is productive. I think for me when you are already tilted in that direction where you believe if there isn’t pain, if there isn’t some degree of suffering, then you’re not trying hard enough. It’s very easy to become a hammer looking for nails and that can have a lot of repercussions for your relationships also. David Senra: For sure. Tim Ferriss: If your self-talk is negative, at least in my experience, what I’ve seen in a lot of my friends and peers and founders, very often you end up having a similar type of dialogue with people around you. That can have huge repercussions. That doesn’t give anyone a neat, tidy silver bullet of an answer, but the negative self-talk, there’s a place for it. The nuance to me matters a lot. If it’s like, “You’re a piece of shit. You always do X. Why don’t you do Y,” and that has a good outcome, I would still want to refine the process. David Senra: I read this biography of Jensen Huang, which is fascinating, because it’s right after one of the best quarters in NVIDIA history. He starts this meeting and he says, “I woke up this morning, looked in the mirror, and said, ‘Why do you suck so much?’” Tim Ferriss: He’s hardcore. David Senra: He’s very hardcore. Tim Ferriss: He’s hardcore. He’s hardcore. I guess what I’d also like to ask you is about not necessarily the people you study, and hopefully you take this as a compliment. It’s intended like a highest compliment. When people ask me about you they’re like, “So what’s the story? Why do people like this stuff?” I’m like, “Well, I can only really speculate,” but I feel like you are, in a way, what Dan Carlin did with Hardcore History, you do for business. Hardcore History is my favorite podcast of all. David Senra: I think Dan Carlin’s the greatest podcaster that ever lived. The reason I do a solo history show is because of Dan Carlin. I’ve given away his back catalog. I wish he would change his business model. Tim Ferriss: It is a bit janky, but if you want to just listen to the greats, I mean the “Wrath of the Khans” — David Senra: “Blueprint for Armageddon”, “Wrath of the Khans”, I think is the best podcast series ever created, in my opinion. “Blueprint for Armageddon”, just everything, I’ve listened to them. I’ve listened. He only has like 55 episodes. He was doing it for 15 years. I fall asleep at night. Right now last night I fell asleep listening to his new one. It’s not even new. It’s like six months old because he never released any episodes, “Mania for Subjugation Part Two”, about the relationship between Alexander the Great and King Philip. Tim Ferriss: Amazing. David Senra: He just puts me to sleep. He is the greatest. Tim Ferriss: The reason that I mentioned that is I feel like I’ve learned so much from Dan Carlin. I’ve learned so much from your episodes. I’m curious though, as I know another person, you’re a fan of Derek Sivers who I’ve known I think since 2007, amazing entrepreneur. People can look him up. I’ll give the one-liner, which is sort of this philosopher king programmer entrepreneur who started companies, gave the vast majority to a charitable trust to fund musical education. At one point, he was the ringleader in a traveling circus, played guitar and sang at a pig state fair, and has just crafted the most unusual and Derek life for himself and given his family permission to do the same for themselves. Really a true, original thinker who also shows it in his actions and this is where I’m going. Derek has this line. I may be paraphrasing it slightly, but the gist is “If more information were the answer, we’d all be billionaires with six pack abs.” What do you see or surmise about people who make the leap from listening to your podcast about all of these icons and people who have not just once you’re lucky, twice you’re good, but in some cases they built $8 billion companies? In that case, I might come back to the acquisition kind of roll-up archetype. The people who make the leap from ingesting information to actually implementing and those who don’t, what’s the missing piece in the middle? David Senra: The way I think about it, the maxim I’ve made for myself on this is learning is not memorizing information. Learning is changing your behavior. If you didn’t change your behavior, this is just all mental gymnastics for you. You’re just wasting your time. What I’m trying to do, I didn’t even understand what I was doing. I had to have, as happens in many cases, somebody outside of you seeing what you’re doing actually gives you what this whole thing is about. I have a good friend of mine. His name’s Jeremy Gafan and he’s really quick-witted and he has a way to condense ideas really well. We’re just walking around taking a walk in Miami Beach one day and he’s like, “Oh, yeah, it’s pretty obvious what this whole thing is.” I didn’t even think he was thinking about it. I was like, “What do you mean?” He’s just like, “Oh, you never had any positive influences. You didn’t have any mentors. If you take somebody like you who’s like psychopathically driven and really has an obsessive personality, that’s what this whole thing is. You’re just reading book after book after book to try to find the path, to try to find the answer, to try to find the way out.” I felt like naked when he said this. I’m like, “I think he’s right. I think he’s right.” For me, I’m definitely not just reading. I’ve been taking all these ideas. The unfair advantage I have is I have one-sided conversations with history’s greatest entrepreneurs. Every week I sit down and read another biography. Then, because I like to talk, this is good because I have to shut up. I can only listen because this is what I think it is. That’s what I think reading a biography is. It’s like one-sided conversation. Then, I take that and I would be doing this even if I didn’t record it, but then sitting down once a week and condensing my thoughts and reacting to it turns it to an act of service. Then, I take the ideas. I’m like, “Oh, that’s a good idea.” I’ll take that and apply it to my business, which is the podcast. It keeps getting better and better. I’m just like, “Oh, these ideas work so I’ll keep doing this.” Then, now what has happened is the people that are trying to be great have studied great people that came before them throughout human history. Caesar was studying Alexander and Steve Jobs was studying Edwin Land and Edwin Land was studying Alexander Graham Bell. If you’re interested in American entrepreneurship, it all kind of goes back to Benjamin Franklin. Everybody looks backwards like, “That guy or that woman was great. How did they do that?” That is an enduring part of human nature that will never change. It’s going to happen while we’re alive. It’s going to happen 1,000 years from now. What I didn’t understand what I was doing is that you put it out into the world just like your work. It’s like a tuning fork, right? It’s like then the people that are really great also do this and they have a deep love of history. If you look at the people that I’ve been talking to from the new show that’s not even released yet, they came because they’re fans. They’re in the audience and it’s just like the para social relationship people have with podcasts. I’m close to the people at Spotify. I’ve been to Stockholm twice in the last six months and I was talking to the head of business at Spotify. His name’s Alex and we were talking for two and a half hours like pretty animated. I was like, “I’m not building a media company. I’m building relationships at scale.” He’s like, “What? Say that again?” I go, “What a podcast is is building relationships to scale.” This is the first time we’ve ever met. Now we should talk about how I found you, but literally I found you on MySpace. I’m going to tell you that. Tim Ferriss: My God. David Senra: The reason, and we’ll go to the influence that you played on having Founders, but I know who you are. We could sit down and talk for eight hours because I know you. There’s no possible way I can consume all of your books and, I don’t know, 600 hours of your podcast and not know Tim. You can’t act for that long. What I didn’t understand is like this other path of me trying to find good information, valuable information. I came from a family. Everybody’s like, “Oh, I’m the first to graduate college.” That’s nice. No one even graduated high school in my family. There’s no reading. There’s no self-improvement. The only thing my family read is the Bible and that can be taken to a crazy extreme. Tim Ferriss: You also didn’t go to prison. David Senra: Exactly. My grandfather, I shouldn’t even say this publicly anymore. You have a big podcast. I would say stuff on small podcasts and forget that things get bigger later on. I say crazy stuff that I should not be saying, but whatever. We’re too late now. My grandfather, my father, my brother, I remember being in high school and hearing “bang.” Five guys at 5:30 in the morning come and grab my brother and I don’t see him for a few years. That’s a fact. My point being is then I’m like, “Oh, wait.” I put this podcast out. Then, it attracts the same people that are in the books and then the fact that I could spend five hours with Michael Dell and he tweets about the podcast and he LinkedIns about it and just giving me phenomenal advice. Then, obviously we record our conversation, but before that they just want to help you because they got value from that. Tim Ferriss: Let me pause you for one second just because I want to go back to the note-taking and then converting that into some type of action. You’ve done that. You’re hitting, and you’ve had a number of these, but inflection points where now you can sit down with some of these icons and have these extended conversations. Even if you did not have that direct access, maybe your process with the note-taking wouldn’t change. I’m just curious how you read one biography or multiple biographies on a person and what the actual note-taking process looks like. I’ll volunteer what I do a lot. I use Kindle not for the convenience of the device, although that is convenient, not because I can listen on Audible or actually do it through the Kindle app and then stop and highlight things, which is also why I use it. The highlighting overall is the reason and then exporting or using something like Readwise in addition to synthesizing my highlights. I believe you also use Readwise quite a bit. I’m not sure if you still use it, but what does your process look like? I know, for instance, like Maria Popova who’s this voluminous, prodigious, genius of a writer, it used to be Brain Pickings. It’s The Marginalian now. She has a very particular process for synthesizing and putting everything together. How do you do that? David Senra: I actually think I’m going to sit down and make an episode about how I make these because I think it’s actually an older idea here that I just went through when I reread James Dyson’s autobiography. Both of them actually, but the first autobiography I’ve read like five times. The second one, I think this is the second or third time I read it. One of the genius things that he did when no one knew who he was, Dyson wasn’t a thing. Now it’s one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world. You walk into a retail store. He had one product in one market at the time and you say, “I’m going to buy a vacuum cleaner.” Five of them kind of look the same and then you have this alien-looking thing at the end. Then, what he said, he’s like, “Hey, what is the advantage I have? I’m going against all these huge multinational conglomerates and I’m just some bloke that cares about vacuum cleaners in this remote part of England.” He convinced all the retailers to let him write a story on a little leaflet and they would hang it on the handle of the Dyson. It tells a story. It’s in 200 or 300 words of who made it, why they made it, why they love it so much, and why you should buy it. People buy stories. That’s what I was saying. It’s like that’s not the first time I came across that idea. You go back to the early 1900s and there’s this guy named Claude Hopkins. I am always interested. You are — Tim Ferriss: I read — David Senra: Scientific Advertising? Tim Ferriss: Yes, in the very beginning. David Senra: I’m always interested in who influences the influencers, right? Let me give you an example. Tim Ferriss: God, I haven’t thought of that name in so many years. David Senra: I have so much shit on this guy. Tim Ferriss: Claude Hopkins. David Senra: I became obsessed. We were talking before we recorded that we both really, I won’t speak for you, love and admire, and mine is borderline idolize, Charlie Munger. If I can only learn from one person for the rest of my life, if you could say, “Hey, you can only read this guy’s words. Pick one person,” I’m picking Munger. I just love everything about him and the idea that I got to meet him is insane, absolutely insane. When I’m reading about Munger and Buffett I’m like, “Man, these guys are really genius.” I didn’t know anything at this time. It’s like 10 years ago and I’m like, “These guys are genius.” Then, they kept mentioning this guy named Henry Singleton over and over again and they will tell you. If you admire somebody, what I think is hugely important, go. They will tell you who influenced them and then you have to go and read about these people. Then, you’ll find who influenced them and you realize that the ideas didn’t start with them. They don’t start with us. They can’t die with us either. You have to push them forward down the generations. I’m like, “Oh, this guy’s interesting. Charlie Munger said that the smartest person he ever met was Henry Singleton. He’s best friends with Buffett. Buffett’s obviously, how did he say that?” Then, Buffett says that it’s a crime that business schools don’t study Singleton. That’s hell of language. That’s — Tim Ferriss: Strong language. David Senra: Strong language, and then you start reading. I’m like, “Oh, my God, the ideas that I thought were Buffett and Munger’s were Singleton’s.” You see this over and over again. I was obsessed. Another guy that Buffett introduced me to was David Ogilvy. David Ogilvy I think is one of the best writers I’ve ever come across and Buffett keeps mentioning this to shareholders. He’s like, “This genius named David Ogilvy.” Why is Buffett calling this guy a genius? Who is this guy? Tim Ferriss: I read Ogilvy’s stuff at the same time that I read Hopkins. David Senra: If you read Ogilvy, what does he talk about? He’s like, “That’s the genius. I’m not the genius. I’m just regurgitating Claude Hopkins’s work.” Then, he tells the story of Albert Lasker who made more money. There’s all these, let’s call them a dozen great advertising agency founders, the Mad Men era. The one that made the most money was this guy named Albert Lasker and he had the simplest business, no art department, no research department. He had Claude Hopkins writing copy and his words rang the cash register. If you can bring more customers to businesses, they will pay you a lot of money and it turns out Claude Hopkins wrote this book called Scientific Advertising. He would try to publish it. It was essentially the secrets of Lasker and Lasker hid it in a safe for 20 years. Tim Ferriss: I’ll get that right over to the agent. Stick that in the safe. David Senra: If you read this, he’s like, “Hey, it may be boring to you.” He uses an example of Schlitz Beer, right? They were fifth in the market share and they hire Hopkins. They’re like, “We want to sell more beer.” He’s like, “Okay.” He does the same thing he does. He does a lot of research and he goes and he tours their distillery. He’s blown away by like that we triple distill the water and I don’t know how beer is made. I don’t even drink that much, but he explains the entire process. Claude’s like, “This is amazing. Why don’t you guys talk about this?” He goes, “Because our process isn’t different than any other distillery.” He goes, “Yeah, but no one’s telling that story.” He writes these huge, essentially 1,500 words, 2,000 words of this is how the beer that you’re about to drink is made and goes from fifth to first because people buy stories. To answer your question, I think what I should do is sit down. Maybe I’ll just clip this and be like, “Okay, this is how I make the podcast or how I consume information.” I think me and you share a love of the writing of Cormac McCarthy. Tim Ferriss: Sure, my God. David Senra: He said — Tim Ferriss: Beautiful and brutal in equal measure. David Senra: Yes, he said something that’s fascinating where he — Tim Ferriss: The Road, Blood Meridian, I mean there are many other examples. David Senra: All The Pretty Horses, The Border Trilogy, just everything the guy just read everything. He’s just incredible. The Road, No Country for Old Men. I saw the movie before I saw the book. It’s crazy how they barely had to change any words. It’s like he wrote a script, so he said something that was fascinating, that subconscious is older than language. And they’re like, “How’d you write Blood Meridian?” He goes, “I didn’t.” He’s like, “I sat there and it came all from my subconscious. I eliminated anything that got in the way of it.” Right? Tim Ferriss: And you must have a busy therapist. David Senra: I couldn’t imagine within that guy’s head to write that book. The Judge. The Judge is the craziest — Tim Ferriss: Really dark. So dark. Anyway. David Senra: So anyways, so I am all intuition, all feeling. So basically what I do is I sit down with a book and usually, I do this physically and it’s like I’m doing arts and crafts over here. I sit down with a physical book because that’s how I fell in love with reading. I don’t have memories before I had love of reading and I think one of the best things that ever happened to me is the fact that I don’t know why reading grabbed a hold of me since I was four or five years old. So my mom was dying of breast cancer. What I said about the only thing they read is the Bible that you could take that to an extreme because she tried for two years. She tried to pray her cancer away. And by that time, by the time we convinced her to see an oncologist, the word he used was the horses out of the barn. And this is the most grueling way to die when it spreads to your bones. It’s just like that happens. I’m calling you to put a pillow over my face. I’m just not going through that. It was just a terrible thing to see. But one of the thing she said, she’s like, you’ve just been like this forever. You were a kid and you’d read the back of cereal boxes. I’d walk in every single room. I did this when I come in here and just automatically read everything that’s on the walls. So I have no idea where this came from. I didn’t choose the passion of reading. It chose me. And all of it is intuition. I sit down with a physical book, that’s how I fell in love with reading. I sit down with pen. Tim Ferriss: Your mom would bring you to the bookstore, right? David Senra: Yes. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They won’t kick you out for reading. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. And the library. And then I remember the first time it was like this maybe before I even knew words because I was obsessed with Where’s Waldo. So it was my first memory. So you’re not reading anything, you’re just finding the guy with the striped shirt or a striped sweater. So basically I sit down with a book, physical book, pen, six-inch ruler, Post-it notes, and scissors. And I just read and I don’t think, and if something jumps out to me, I highlight it, and then whatever pops to my mind. And normally as our mutual friends like Patrick, Chris, Rick, they’ll all see this. It’s just like I’m not actually listening to what you’re saying. There’s an idea behind it. Tim Ferriss: Meaning you’re not taking what the author says literally. You’re looking at the idea behind — David Senra: I’m just looking for the essence. So if me and Rick are talking about a giant deal that he wants to invest in, I’m thinking about how that’s similar to how Fred Smith built FedEx or how Jim Casey built UPS or how Buffett thought about buying See’s Candy. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do with the Post-it notes and the scissors and the ruler? David Senra: So basically, I underline that sentence and then whatever popped in my mind and I’m like, oh, this is kind of like James J. Hill when he was building the only profitable successful American railroad and you just write down whatever comes to mind. Tim Ferriss: On the Post-it? David Senra: On the Post-it. Tim Ferriss: And that goes on the page. David Senra: It goes on the page. David Senra: So then I’m writing it down and then I might have three sentences, but the Post-it note’s three by five, so I have to cut it. It has to be clean, it has to look good. There’s a beauty to it. I am irrational, crazy when it comes to this stuff. This is why I think I picked up on your work right away. I see a fellow nutcase and obsessive we’re like, I hand edit, now, my transcripts. So everybody’s like, “You should outsource it to AI. You should outsource it to India.” No, I have to touch it. I have to feel it. I just love it. I’m not doing it to do it quicker. I like what Jerry Seinfeld says. “The hard way is the right way.” I like the hard way. This also goes back to obviously have some kind of dark thing driving me, which we can dive into if you want. So then you go through the entire book and so then I have to take pictures of it into the Readwise app because you do it the smarter way. Kindle will just automatically go to Readwise. Tim Ferriss: Well, I still use physical. I’ll explain. I can trade. I’ll tell you how I use physical. David Senra: You want to go do it now, or you want — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Well, okay, so don’t lose your place. David Senra: I won’t. Tim Ferriss: All right, you got the scissors. I want to know about the ruler. Oh, I guess the ruler. David Senra: Straight lines. It has to be straight. It has to be beautiful. Tim Ferriss: So we both have pretty moderate to severe OCD. I remember when I was diagnosed by the psychiatrist who was doing some preliminary formality of taking me through these assessments before I was going to have this experimental brain stimulation, “Send me experimental.” And he had to check the boxes and went through these hours and hours of stuff and he’s like, “Why don’t you to take a seat? If we need to take a break, I understand.” And he gave me this OCD diagnosis. I’m like, “Yeah, what else is new? Keep going.” David Senra: “I knew this about myself.” Tim Ferriss: “Yeah, I don’t need time.” The way I use physical, and I do use physical still quite a bit, is I will, and this is another question that maybe you can answer when you pick back up is how a second or third reading differs from the first. Because when I read it the first time, I’m doing something very similar to you. I’m underlining things or if that’s just too much work, the book is actually a gem and it has a lot. Then I will just bracket it on the side of the paragraph so that I know what the highlight is. Then I will go through, if I read it a second time, and I will put T2 in a circle next to the things that still stuck out on a second reading. Now sometimes you’re just a different person if you read it five years later and your lived experience and your position is life is different. But if I’m doing it in somewhat rapid succession, I want to see what sticks on a second or third reading. So you’ll see T2, T3, etc. Sometimes, it’s just fun to see how I change over time with The Moral Letters to Lucilius by Seneca the Younger — people can find it in all sorts of compendiums. I put out a free PDF called The Tao of Seneca. I like to just see where I am at different points in my life, what resonates. And then, typically with any physical book I’m creating, I just did this with a book I finished yesterday called Deep Tech by Pablos Holman where I’m creating an index in the front. So whenever there’s a page that really, really sticks out, I’ll write down like 168, whatever it might be. Someone I want to look up, someone like a Claude Hopkins, whose name gets dropped and I’m like, that seems important. All right. And so I have this index and then I’ll take a photograph of the index just in case I lose the book, which has happened. And that’s always painful. I also will have, I’ll make a little box on the bottom right-hand corner of some of the front matter pages and I’ll put next steps there. David Senra: Wait, what’s the front matter? Tim Ferriss: So the front matter would be the copyright page, the title page, the pages that don’t really have any content on them. Maybe there’s the dedication page like ‘To Mom’, it’s like, okay, that’s a blank page that I can use. So on the bottom right-hand corner, just two lines that create sort a box, I’ll write down next steps. So for every book, not every book, in some cases if it’s just for pleasure and it’s fiction, but even then sometimes ideas will pop into mind. I’ll be like, okay, what is at least one kind of next step? Maybe it’s looking up someone like Claude Hopkins. Maybe it’s an action, maybe it’s a phone call, maybe it’s an email. But along the lines of David Allen and Getting Things Done, it’s like one physical next action. And so I almost always have that in nonfiction books. So that’s photos. I take photos of all that. I used to put it all into Evernote. I still sometimes do that because I’ve been using it forever and I have thousands of them. But you’re the last Evernote standing. I might be, yeah, I use scannable to get it into Evernote, but the point is I have a way to then OCR it so I can search it. All right, back to — David Senra: So that’s basically what I have to do now, which takes an unbelievable amount of time. But again, then now, so I’ve already read it one time. Now I have to input it into Readwise, right? So you take a picture of it and it’s laborious and now I’ve read it for the second or maybe a third time. Then you see on page and then you have to make sure that it matches up between the page and what’s on your screen. And so you’re reading it over and over again. So then I get it all into Readwise, then I will go back — Tim Ferriss: Do you want to take a sidebar just to explain what Readwise is? David Senra: Readwise is essentially just a way to keep track of your notes and highlights from everything you read. And now they’re expanding out because it turns out the total just on the market for people that want to keep highlights and notes, first of all, how many people are reading books now? That number is dwindling unfortunately. And then of that subset of smaller and dwindling people, how many read as much as you and I do? And then they want to actually research essentially giant, searchable database of everything you’ve ever read. It’s super valuable and they charge like $99 a year for it. So now basically they were running this for six years. They have a new web reader app and they said they made more money in six months from that than they didn’t Readwise for six years. This is obviously not a lot of people that want to do this. The thing that we’re describing doing. So then I used to read the physical book because actually let’s back up and I want to tell you the role that you played. And don’t let me forget where I’m at though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I won’t. David Senra: So I went to a shitty college because I remember when I was in your senior year, I went to public high school and everybody’s like, “Where are you going to school?” And I didn’t understand what they meant. I’m like, “The one I can drive to, the one I can go to at night because I have to work during the day. I don’t know where you’re talking about.” I didn’t know. I got kicked out of my house when I was 18 and I had to live in student housing. Tim Ferriss: Why did you get kicked out? David Senra: My mom’s side of the family has severe mental illness and just some of the worst people you’ve ever met. And they just had this belief that you kick your kids out when you’re 18, it’s just like — Tim Ferriss: Out of the nest. David Senra: It is not even that. It’s like they pick a fake fight and you have somebody that’s very, I’m not, that was the point of contention between my mom is she had undiagnosed mental illness for sure, maybe not schizophrenic, definitely bipolar. Her sister was schizophrenic. And listen man, as you get older, at the time I had a lot of anger, super, a lot of anger, didn’t understand why they’re doing what you’re doing and then you get older and then you have your own kids. So I went through this crazy thing where I think I hated them even more because when my daughter was born, I’m like, I remember seeing her for the first time. I was like, you think you love a woman? No. Enzo Ferrari has this great line that “It’s impossible for a man to love a woman. The only true love he has is for his kids.” And I understand what he meant. I think Ryan Reynolds said it best where it’s like “I never thought I’d love anybody as much as I love Blake Lively. And then she gave birth to our daughter and as soon as I looked at her daughter, I knew if we were ever under attack, I would use Blake as a human shield to protect that baby.” It’s funny, but it’s literally when I heard him say that, I go, “Yes.” Tim Ferriss: Right. David Senra: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: So that makes the memory all the more painful. David Senra: Then I was like, how did you do this to your children? And then you get — there’s another — you get more experience and then you’re like, yes, but imagine you grew up like they did, poor white trash. My grandfather raped all his daughters, including my mothers. Raped all of his daughters, raped his gr — I didn’t know about this until after he died or else I would’ve been the one to put them in his grave, raped his daughters, raped his granddaughters. They lived in this shitty house in Indiana with one bathroom that was in — there was two-bedroom, she had three sisters. The only bathroom is in my gr — I call them grandparents. I hate them with all of my being in their room. And so if you wanted to go in the bedroom at night, he was a monster. They would urinate in cups and pour it out the window. So again, it doesn’t excuse the bad decisions that they made and the unhappy marriage my parents had and all this other crap. It was just like, “All right, imagine that. Imagine that. You destroyed your kids. That person was supposed to protect them and I can’t even talk about this.” So anyways, we would fight a lot and she’d be alternate depending on the day, she’d be the kindest person in the world or a storm. And so the unfortunate part was when she got diagnosed with cancer, we hadn’t spoken for six months, so she only survived another, I think, two years. So that means the last two and a half years I missed — what? That’s 20 percent, 25 percent of her life. And somebody’s like, “What were you guys fighting over?” I was like, “The sad thing is I don’t remember.” But I was not one to let, I was very hardheaded. And so she had some weird fight with me. I don’t remember what it was. And then she was like, “You’re not allowed to live here.” Kicked me out, I didn’t have anything. So anyways, I went to, I lived in student housing and that was the first time — they randomly assign you a roommate and it was like the son of a rich rancher because our fridge was full of all this meat stuff, which is bad because it was the summer where Florida got hit by four hurricanes and all the meat went rotting. Tim Ferriss: Spoiled. David Senra: Oh, yes, it was disgusting, but I didn’t know that there were people legitimately, this makes me sound like an absolute moron, but I didn’t know that there were people that only went to college because my roommate didn’t have a job. He just drank and went to — I’m like, “What else do you do?” He was like, “What?” This is crazy. So I don’t know where I was going with that. Tim Ferriss: You were taking a pause on Readwise and multiple reads and you’re like, “I’ve got to tell you how I found you.” David Senra: Oh, okay. So again, I’m in a crappy school. It’s a state school in Orlando, UCF. I almost said UFC where it’s MMA. That would’ve been probably more useful now. So UCF, and this is when Facebook was coming out, but Facebook was only at the fancy schools. Tim Ferriss: Yes, right. It was very much at the fancy schools. David Senra: We didn’t have Facebook, we had MySpace. And so remember you’d go and there would be music playing on somebody’s profile? Well, people would, they would list their favorite movies and favorite books. And I think I was looking at a girl’s — probably — profile. And under favorite books, it said 4-Hour Workweek. I’m like, that’s a great title, what is that? And I immediately order it on Amazon and then I start reading it, obviously. Then that book inspired, I don’t know, 25 million people, maybe even more, but now and then I start consuming all your stuff. So I’d buy all your books. I bought your TV show. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I appreciate that. David Senra: Sometimes I’ll forget because you go on like — whatever, it’s not called iTunes anymore. And I don’t buy anything because everything streams. I’m like Tim Ferriss, [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: I know from the Natural History Museum back in the day. David Senra: So I was obsessed with podcasts, I discovered in 2010, and before I started mine in 2016, I listened to thousands of them. And you had one that changed my life, which was when you did Jocko. And that was 2015 if I remember correctly. And you told him to start a podcast and I think Rogan told him to do it as well. And he’s like, well, if I got these two guys, obviously he’s smart. Just take the advice. And I started listening to his podcast and he changed format. But in the beginning it was just him doing, he would read a first-person account, so an autobiography of somebody in combat and I could not believe what I was hearing. And so what I would do is I’d listen maybe a hundred of the books or I listen to a hundred of his episodes and maybe buy a dozen of the books. So you learn, even on the episodes, you don’t read the book, you learn so much and you’re inspired. And in the books, he kept introducing me all kinds of crazy stories and I was like, Hey. A couple months later then obviously I had started reading biographies because your friend Kevin Rose did this excellent interview with Elon Musk, we can talk about from 2012. And I was like, what if I do Jocko’s format, but I’m interested in four things. I’m interested in reading, history, podcasts, and entrepreneurship. And so if you look at it’s like it just sits in between those four. And I started doing that and essentially I was just imitating Jocko and no one gave a shit for five and a half years. Tim Ferriss: Yes. Wow. What a wild story. So I want to dive into that. The interview with Jocko, I owe special thanks to, I think it was Peter Attia — David Senra: He was. Tim Ferriss: Who made the introduction. David Senra: He said, just trust me on this. Tim Ferriss: And — David Senra: Then didn’t he just show up at your house or something? Tim Ferriss: Yes, we hung out in San Francisco. I remember exactly which coffee shop we went to. And I made the mistake. I wasn’t even thinking properly. I had a camo shirt on and I was like, I can’t believe I wore a fucking camo shirt to meet someone as legitimate as Jocko Willink. And I was just like, oh, facepalm. But we ended up connecting. That was his first ever public interview, which is wild. David Senra: One of the best ones ever done. Tim Ferriss: Oh. I mean he really brought the heat as Jocko — David Senra: He’s my alarm every morning. He’s like, “Get up.” I swear to God, I’m not joking. He’s been my alarm for half a decade. He yells at me. I’m like, “You’re right.” Tim Ferriss: Yes, Extreme Ownership still highly, highly, highly recommend to everyone. And if you want to hear me and Jocko go toe to toe, not really toe to toe, we’re sort of shoulder to shoulder with a book we did Musashi. David Senra: Episode 100. Tim Ferriss: Episode 100, which was like four and a half, five hours long going through this historical novel about the most famous swordsman in Japanese history. David Senra: I read that because of that episode. Tim Ferriss: Oh, so good. David Senra: I think I read the audiobook first. It’s 60 hours long or something. Tim Ferriss: It’s really long. And keeping in mind, this was originally published in Japanese in a country of whatever the population is like 120, 150 million. I think it sold 80 to a hundred million copies. I mean something just completely insane. And who knows, I might be getting that off, but the numbers are just astonishing as a ratio of the total population. So five and a half years, how do you explain no one giving a shit for five and a half years? In other words, was there something that happened, a decision you made, something that changed things around the five and a half year mark? Was it a change in technology? David Senra: Oh, change in business model. Tim Ferriss: What happened? Yes. David Senra: Literally I was doing nothing different, changing business model. So you remember podcasting back in there, because you were one of the OGs and you had this massive audience. Your blog was crazy. You were huge and still are. And I was none of those things. I was a weird introvert. I didn’t have any social media, I didn’t know anything about the internet. I don’t know how to describe. I just would like to read and record a podcast in my kitchen on a hundred-dollar microphone. And I remember calling around and trying to figure out what’s the business model here? And everybody was like, “Oh, it’s ads.” I’m like, “Oh, that’s great.” And so at the time there was these ad networks, essentially they just sell ads for you and they’re like, we’d love to work with you, you just have to have 50,000 downloads per show. And I go, “What? I will never! 50,000?” It seemed like such a big number. “That will never ever happen.” Tim Ferriss: In the universe of podcasts, it’s still a big number. David Senra: Yes, but now there’s a million. Think about how many people listen to The Tim Ferriss Show and there’s millions and millions and millions of people over the course of a year or whatever. So I was like, “Oh, my God, that’s never going to happen.” And so then you’d say, “Okay, well, what can you do?” And back then it’d be affiliate. So remember, Audible scaled massively. People don’t realize how big businesses can get on the back of podcasts, and how many have. Audible was, it was on every — Dan Carlin had one ad and it was an Audible ad. Tim Ferriss: It was Audible. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: They were very smart about that. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yes. They’ve been able to change a lot of their economics — David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: For the better, for Audible and Amazon since capturing more market share. But they did an excellent job of marketing and advertising. David Senra: They were on every single podcast. And so I did that. And then there was this company called Blinkist, which was a — Tim Ferriss: Summaries? David Senra: Summary, 10-minute summary app for business books, non-fiction books. And that blew my mind because so you only got paid on sales and they would show you not the people, but where the country was. And I remember the first time somebody in Japan bought, I’m like, I’m sitting in Miami in my kitchen, “Great acoustics, by the way, you idiot.” On a hundred-dollar mic with no pop filter, no nothing. There was nothing out there, there was no — editing a podcast now with the script and all the AI tools, it’s like magic compared to what we had to do back then. And I was like, what? Somebody in Japan listened to this thing? This was crazy. So the one idea I had, there is this, I actually got the business model from a socialist podcast. Tim Ferriss: Might’ve been the beginning of the troubles. David Senra: So there was this, for a long time when I opened a browser, my homepage would be this thing called Graphtreon. Graphtreon is essentially they use the Patreon API and you see people building membership communities. And what was interesting about them is people sell comic books, they would sell podcasts, they would sell newsletters, videos, and the most popular category was podcasts. I’m like, that’s weird. And so at the time, this podcast called Chapo Trap House was the number one and they had 25,000 people. Tim Ferriss: Thing is on Patreon. David Senra: Yes. And the only way you see this is because Graphtreon would aggregate the data for you and present it to you. And so, at the time, I think they had 20,000 paid subscribers, at least $5 a month. And their business model is simple. Every other podcast you have to pay for, so you can listen to half them for free. If you want more, just pay five bucks a month and you can listen to it in a podcast player. Like anything else, you just have to go through the paywall. And every month I’m watching and the number gets higher and higher and higher. Now if you pull up Graphtreon, I think the number one is Shane Gillis, I think he’s got 120,000 paid subscribers. So I was like, oh, there’s like a business here with what if I had a subscription podcast? So it’s one thing to pay five bucks a month for a comedy podcast, but my podcasts are about business. If there’s ideas on this podcast that will make people more money, which is essentially what business education comes down to, you want to be more successful at what you do, there’s some kind of, hopefully you see a better economic outcome for yourself and your family. I was like, what if I could just sell subscriptions? Because I’m not selling enough Audible subscriptions and Blinkist, that’s not going to happen. And my idea was, I think I was completely in love with podcasting and still am. It’s the only thing I think about. I work on seven days a week. It’s completely taken over my life. And my idea was I don’t even have to be wealthy, I just have to do this for a living. It has to come out of me. It’s like I had no control over this. And I was like, maybe I can make dentist money. So my idea was like, I bet you I can sell 3,000 paid subscriptions at a hundred dollars a pop, make 300 grand a year. And then I also have a lot of self-confidence like, well, if I could sell 3,000, I could sell 20,000, and then maybe I can sell as many as Chapo can and then I’m making two million. This is the idea I had. And so my idea was the genius idea I had was like, “Hey, your most valuable asset you have, which is your podcasts, they are easy to share and everything else, let’s put a big wall in front of that.” And so I put a giant paywall in front of it and obviously it slows growth because how are you going to share the episode? And the one benefit I had, which really kept me going, and I don’t think I would’ve quit anyways, I really don’t think I had any other option, but was that we don’t know who’s going to listen to this one. We just see numbers on the screen. But with a subscription, you see the email address and the emails were the top founders and top VCs and I had a very small audience and one of them was our mutual friend, Patrick O’Shaughnessy. And I was a huge fan of Patrick. And I saw, I’m not going to repeat his email address here, but I know what the, I was like, I saw that come across and there were so few, I saw every single one. You’re getting like 10 a day, I don’t know, five a day or something like that paid. And I’m like, oh, my God, Patrick bought one. He didn’t know who I was. He didn’t know I was a big fan of his, didn’t know anything. I had no followers. I think I had 7,000 followers across all, every one of my accounts. And I was trying really hard back then. And he goes, “I never find good podcasts to listen to. I think David Senra’s Founders podcast is excellent. You should listen to it.” And he linked to that one and Estée Lauder and I could not believe it. Because I was like, why do I have these mentions on Twitter? What is a mention? I don’t get mentions. What is this new thing? And then I log into my email and it’s just because back then you would get an email every time you get a new pay subscription and off of one tweet of an endorsement by people. This is why you and Andrew are kind of like the male Oprah. And I mean that in the — you know how much shit I’ve bought because you told me that it’s good. Why? Because of the trust that, people chase numbers. It’s like that. You’re not chasing numbers, you’re chasing trust and relationships. I love what Warren Buffett said: “A brand is a promise.” The fact that you guys have such high standards, I’ve never bought anything like what the hell was Tim thinking? And so that’s what makes you so valuable. So Patrick extended that trust to me where I logged into my email and you couldn’t stop scrolling. You couldn’t stop scrolling. And so I screenshotted that because — Tim Ferriss: Patrick’s a good dude. Very smart too. Invest Like the Best. David Senra: Yes. You did an excellent episode with him for when you hit your 10-year anniversary. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yes. 10 years.David Senra: And then I was a huge NBA fan and the person that found me, that’s been really, really helpful. When I had 1,500 listeners, guy named Sam Hinkie, former general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, very, very intelligent, intense, and kind of reclusive guy. Now he’s really hard to get to. And we had talked a bunch and he’s just like, “I really think you have something here. I think you’re — what you’re doing is important and I’ve tried to help you as much as I can.” And I knew him and Patrick were friends, and I screenshotted Patrick’s tweet. I was like, “Look what your friend Patrick did.” Sam didn’t say anything. He just put it, and again, Patrick trusts Sam and Sam’s telling Patrick, “This guy’s worth your time.” He put us in group chat. He goes, “You two need to know each other.” And I was like, “Patrick, I’m a huge fan. Love to talk to you.” And Patrick doesn’t have a calendar. So he’s like, “What about right now?” And I was like, “Well, let me look at my calendar.” Nothing. Nothing. Literally nothing. I was like, “Yes.” We talked for the first, first time we talked was an hour and a half. And we get to the end, he goes, “I thought I was in the podcast.” And then we become friends. And then I joined his network and then he just poured gasoline on a promising spark. Tim Ferriss: Was he the one who convinced you to remove the wall? Or how did you end up — David Senra: No. So a friend of mine, again, this is the sad part about becoming, getting more following is so many of my close friends now came from DMs. And now you can’t do that. You can’t even look at mentions. Tim Ferriss: Yes. David Senra: I’d be curious. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t work. David Senra: Yes, it’s it kind of rule. It’s such a magical thing. And now because, Tim Ferriss: Yes, well once verified could be purchased, it destroyed the utility of meeting those people on. David Senra: It’s like what Charlie Munger said, if you have a bunch of raisins in just a few turds, you still got turds and you could have 99 percent of the people are nice to you. And then it’s these psychos and you’re like, I can’t read my mentions anymore. Can’t check my DMs. It’s sad.But one of, I met a couple friends through them and again, I was grinding out hundred-dollar-year subscriptions, just like going to the factory every day trying to sell a few more. And one of my friends told me what one of his friends’ company just paid to advertise on one of the biggest business podcasts. And the number was like, what, what did you just say? And then Sam and other people like Patrick, they’re just like, “This is weird thing that you’re doing. Why don’t you just sell ads like everybody else?” And I was like, “Look at China. They’re 90 percent subscription to your podcast.” Like, “Yeah, but you’re American, you idiot.” And so I came up with all these crazy, because I can be very convincing in the opposite direction. It doesn’t have to be a good idea, I can talk myself into good ideas, but I can talk myself into bad ideas too. And so eventually I called Patrick one day and I was just like, “Man, I am fighting with one hand behind my back. This is really, really difficult. I think I’m going to make an ad based version of Founders.” He’s like, “Yeah, no shit. I’ve been telling you to do this forever.” And then I was like, “And I’d like it to be on your network.” And he’s like, “Ooh, that’s interesting.” And again, he’s just a good dude, and he’s like, “Yeah, but I own all podcasts on my network. Will you sell me equity?” And I don’t know why I said this, and I was like, “No.” It was crazy, and I’d had all these acquisition investment offers up until that point, because obviously everybody in the audience likes to do deals, so they like trying to allocate capital. Tim Ferriss: That’s their sport. David Senra: Yeah, and I was like, “No, no, no.” It wasn’t a business thing to me, it’s like a special thing. It’s like part of my soul. Michael Dell has this great answer when he was fighting with Carl Icahn when, and they’re like, “Why don’t you just start another company?” And he’s like, “I like this company. First of all, it has my name on it,” and he goes, “I’m going to care about this company after I’m dead.” So that’s how I feel, it’s a rational love that I have for this. And so I was like, “I don’t want to sell equity, but.” He’s like, “What do you want?” I was like, “I want you to help amplify my audience and connect me with first-rate advertisers. Then we could just share ad revenue.” And one call he’s like, “Done.” That completely changed everything. That was four years ago. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Thank God for Patrick, huh? David Senra: Oh, for sure. I talk to him almost every day. We’re like brothers, I called him this morning. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. He’s a very, very good guy. Tim Ferriss: Well, let’s just, actually, I’m going to zoom into your expertise, subject matter for a second, and then I want to talk more about podcasting, but just so it doesn’t become too much inside baseball, I do want to come back and talk about podcasting. But you have mentioned a number of different names at the top of your list, people to learn from. Where does Edwin Land fit into that, and who is Edwin Land? David Senra: Edwin Land is the patron saint of Founders. I want a picture of him in my house like The Last Supper, it would just be Edwin Land in the middle like Jesus. Again, I’m very interested in who influences the influencers, and where do these ideas actually come from? And Steve Jobs, if you have a Mount Rushmore of greatest entrepreneurs, his face has got to be on it, undoubtedly. He created the most successful product in history. I think he did it for the right reasons. I think he’s a very fascinating person, obviously incredibly flawed as a human, which he even said. But what’s fascinating is if you go back, and which I do, is when I read a biography of somebody, I will make a list going back to your outline of what I’ll do in the front of the books, which you called, what’s? Tim Ferriss: Front matter. David Senra: Front matter. I didn’t even know that term till now, thank you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I will write down all the other founders or all the other people they’ll talk about. And so I just did this with James Dyson. He’s obsessed with Buckminster Fuller and Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Jeremy Fry and Alec Issigonis, and all these people. He just repeats them over and over again and you just realize, oh, he studied these guys and then took their ideas and said, those ideas are good. I’ll use them and then make $60 billion or whatever his company’s worth. Tim Ferriss: Everyone should read about Buckminster Fuller. David Senra: I haven’t read the book yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I’ve read his ideas, but not the book that James read when he was in college. It’s fascinating to me how it’s almost all — and they usually find it early. I had lunch with Sam Zell. I’m talking to him. Tim Ferriss: How did he make his money, for people who don’t know? David Senra: Well, people consider him an investor. He calls himself an entrepreneur. He called himself an entrepreneur. What he’s most well known for is in 2007, he sold, I think the biggest real estate company in history for 38 billion to Blackstone. He tipped at the very top of the market, but he just likes to essentially buy businesses, try to make them grow. He would sell some, so that’s why people consider him an investor. But he considered himself an entrepreneur originally. By the time I met him, he had 61 years of experience as an entrepreneur. And my favorite entrepreneurs are I love talking to these people that have 40, 50, I’m not interested in the startup founder at all. This 25-year-old kid that thinks he’s smart, he doesn’t have enough experience yet. Life is going to teach you what you need. Tim Ferriss: People who’ve ridden many multiple macroeconomic cycles who have had to contend with different challenges at different points in their lives, not just when they have no responsibilities and no dependence, et cetera. David Senra: Well, he says something in his autobiography that you were speaking to earlier. He’s like, “Yeah, earlier in my life, my career fought my marriages and my career won and that’s why I’ve been married three times.” The very current theme is that you look at life as everything that’s not work as an unpleasant distraction, and you wonder why your relationship’s broken because you’re not spending any time there. Of course, that’s the outcome, and they all make this mistake over and over again. So what’s fascinating about this is we’ll go back to Edwin Land in a minute. Sam Zell. In his biography, he’s like, “Dude, I’m in college.” This guy was making millions of dollars a year when he was in law school. That’s how good of an entrepreneur he was from day one. Tim Ferriss: Was that real estate? David Senra: Yeah. He was developing, I think student housing at the time, I think the student housing, but he was also doing deals. He’s just a very gifted deal maker, and you see this with Rick. Understanding, you’ll bring something to Rick and he’ll be like, “Oh, here’s 10 things that are important.” Tim Ferriss: Do you want to explain who Rick is briefly? David Senra: His name is Rick Gerson. He’s one of my closest friends. You’ve known him for what? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know, 15, 20 years, a long time. David Senra: 15, 20 years, he’s one of the most generous, thoughtful, and also simultaneously super intense people I know. Tim Ferriss: He’s a master of finance, came out of this just sort of amazing training environment. We can just call that for what it is for now in simplicity and is one also of the best connected humans I’ve ever met.He identifies, there’s one thing. He learned that from Sam, and then Sam learned that from this guy named Jay Pritzker. It’s very fascinating, so. Tim Ferriss: Chicago royalty. David Senra: Yes, 100 percent. So I actually just backed, it’s not a Kickstarter, but it’s almost like this. There’s no biographies of Jay, and so there’s a guy named Rockwood Notes that essentially put his hat out. He’s like, “Hey, I want to do this, but I need to make at least, I think, 40,000 a year to write this book,” and he’s selling $800 or a thousand dollars a year subscriptions. I was like, “Yeah, I’ll obviously sign up for this. I want a Jay Pritzker biography.” So Sam Zell in his autobiography, he’s like, “Yeah, I read this book by William Zeckendorf and it changed my life because there’s one idea in this book.” It’s what Charlie Munger said, there’s ideas worth billions in a $30 history book. There was this thing called Hawaiian technique. William Zeckendorf was this real estate developer in New York, and he came from nothing and then made a lot of money, then lost it all, and then made a lot of money, then lost it all again and dies with no money, so you want to avoid that too. But he had this thing called the Hawaiian technique, which was, hey, if you just parcel out a building and you sell the different parts to whoever values it more, you’ll make more money. So the lease is valued higher by these guys, and the land is valued higher, and maybe the commercial real estate there or whatever, he just would break it apart like Legos and sell it independently and make a little money. What Sam realized, he started using that real estate and he goes, “Oh, this works in business too.” He’d buy business. It’s like maybe you want the IP, maybe you want the talent, maybe you want the actual physical assets. And he’d do this over and over again. So I remember telling Sam to his face, and Sam had no filter, and he was exactly who you thought he was. If you watched any videos, he’s just like this and I go, “Yeah, I bought that book that you recommended.” He goes, “Did you read it?” I go, “No.” He goes, “Read it,” he’s got the gravelly voice. “Read it.” I was like, “Oh, shit, okay.” And I read it as soon as I went home and started reading it. Sam Zell tells you to read a book, just read a book. But the reason I bring this up is because you’ll see this over and over again. They’ll find somebody early. You can go back and read this Playboy interview just for the, I hope when you, it’s just for the interview. Tim Ferriss: Just for the interview. David Senra: It’s not for anything else, of Steve Jobs when he’s 25, 26, and he’s talking about the fact that we have the wrong role models and heroes as a society. We want to be. Now, he’d say — you want to be YouTubers or something. We want to be athletes. We want to be all these other things. We should want to be Edwin Land. And at the time, Edwin Land was the founder of Polaroid. Edwin Land’s in his seventies. Jobs meets him, spends time with him a bunch of times. Edwin Land at that time had the third most patents of any American in history. I think it was Thomas Edison, the second guy, and then Edwin Land, or maybe it’s the first guy, and then Thomas Edison, but Edwin Land was up there, and what you would realize is when Jobs goes on stage and says, “Hey, I wanted to build Apple. I wanted to build a company at the of liberal arts and technology,” and he has that, he literally puts the street sign up on there. That is literally a direct quote from Edwin Land. Edwin Land wanted to build a company at the intersection of liberal arts and technology. He wanted to make completely vertically integrated consumer products that were magical, that had a magical experience. In Edwin Land’s case, he invented the industry that he then comes to dominate. There was no such thing as instant photography. So when we’re like, how great is the iPhone compared to one that came before it? The difference is vast, but not the same thing as if me and you were hanging out before Edwin Land was on this Earth. We take a picture at a party, “How’d it come out? Well, we’ll find out two weeks from now when we get it back from Kodak.” Tim Ferriss: Turns out it was a shot of my foot. David Senra: As opposed to, “Wait a minute and we’re going to see it right here in the Polaroid.” And then dude, the amount of ideas that Jobs took from him. Go look at the freaking tables that Jobs uses when he gives presentations. The actual table, it’s the same table that Edwin Land gave when he gave presentations. Tim Ferriss: If somebody wants to study Edwin Land, where do they start? David Senra: I read this biography of Edwin Land I thought was incredible. It’s called Insisting on the Impossible. It’s the most comprehensive biography of him. People read it, they’re like, “This book sucks.” I think it’s riveting. There is a book, I think it’s called Land’s Polaroid. That’s the one I’d read because it’s only 250 pages and it’s written by a guy that worked for and with Edwin Land for 20 years. And I love those kinds of things because you see them over a decade. But my point being is Jobs was talking about this guy when he was 25. Jobs knows he’s dying when he’s working with Isaacson on the biography, he knows he’s dying and he’s still talking about Edwin Land appears in Isaacson’s biography of Jobs six times. Why is he still talking about this guy? How could you not be interested in understanding why? What is it about this guy that he admired and liked? Yeah, and he has a saying that, he has a personal motto that I love and that I try to do. And Edwin Land’s, there’s two of them. Edwin Land says, “My personal motto is very personal. It may not apply to anybody else or anybody else or any other company, but is don’t do anything that someone else can do.” The importance of differentiation. I’m shocked at how few people understand how important it is. Dyson, Dyson’s whole thing is it has to be different. Even if it’s worse, it should be different. He demands difference. He’s got a very fascinating business philosophy. Dyson’s mind’s incredible. And then the other thing is he knows because he dropped out of Harvard, he goes, “There’s something they don’t teach you at Harvard Business School, that anything worth doing is worth doing to excess.” Tim Ferriss: So how do you think about different archetypes? Perhaps that’s the best word to use within the pantheon of successful entrepreneurs. The reason I ask that is that I imagine you get questions that along the lines of, and I get questions like this also, when you look across all of the biographies, what are some of the common patterns? Give me the top five, top six, and then people want to grab that recipe. But it could be just to use a sports analogy, it’s like, all right, you’re taking the stretching routine from LeBron James, the weight training routine from Arnold Schwarzenegger and this and this and this. You’re grabbing habits from mutants that are in entirely different spheres where they have different bodies entirely and then trying to cobble it together. It may not work. That’s point number one, probably won’t work. Number two is that within the world of business advice, whether it’s autobiographies, biographies, interviews, there’s a lot that conflicts. So you have one person who says, “Anything that’s worth doing is worth overdoing,” and then you can tell who the novice is because they do too much. And I’m wondering how you think of entrepreneurship for yourself in terms of modeling different people or taking advice because you could have two people, just to use a metric that’s easy for everybody to wrap their head around two billionaires and they give you diametrically opposed advice. How do you personally pick? David Senra: There’s no formula. This is actually something, one of the things I’m so thrilled with is the fact that I’ve become friends with Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, and this is something we’re actually trying to work on together because he brings this up. He’s like, “We need alternative founder archetypes.”And back up, first of all, Daniel is an alien. There is a specific reason that I wanted him to be the very first guest on the new show is I’m able to build relationships with other people. Daniel’s very special in the sense that he’s only a few years older than me, but he’s so much more wiser than I am. I don’t know how I can put this in words, it makes sense, but because he’s founded and is still running a $120 billion company, he’s been running for 19 years, but to me, he’s still so underrated. And the thing about Daniel is not only is he wicked smart, but he’s given me some of the best advice. And he does it in a very reserved and very precise way. He’s got very clear thinking, and I just cannot get over how generous he is with his time and his advice to me. He told me one of the things that was really important, he said an offhand comment, but he’s like, “You’re really easy to understand, so therefore you’re easy to help. I know what is important to you, and so therefore you’re easy to help and you’re easy to interface with.” And so his point is every young founder thinks they have to be an Elon or Steve Jobs, and he’s like, “But I’m not like an Elon or Steve Jobs.” And the massive success, not only what he’s done for Spotify, one of the best apps ever created. I think they have the most, I think there’s only one other company in the world that has more paid subscribers than they do, and it’s Netflix. But think about the way you feel when you get done using Spotify. And this is why I like all the top people there too and they’ve also been working together for excessively a long time. Gustav, Alex, Daniel, all of them is they want you when you’re done using Spotify to feel good. If me and you spend an hour listening to our favorite music on Spotify, you feel great. You spend an hour listening to Tim Ferriss’ podcast, inspired, you feel great. An audiobook now, you feel great. I spend an hour on TikTok or Reels, I feel like shit. Like Twitter? Oh, I can’t. Tim Ferriss: It’s like the anti-therapy. David Senra: But they’re trying to put something. Tim Ferriss: If you want to send yourself backwards. David Senra: So I like what they’re doing. Tim Ferriss: Is there any other advice that has stuck from Daniel to you? David Senra: Yeah, so let’s go to the — Tim Ferriss: And then I won’t lose track of that. David Senra: The archetype I think is really important. I think you’ll really vibe with what his opinion on or his perspective on this is. Yeah, Daniel will tell you advice in a, he’s like a wise old man. I don’t know how to describe it. So one thing is implied and never explicitly stated is he just doesn’t feel he has any, there’s no ceiling on what he can achieve, or what he can learn, or the effect he can have in the world. And when you spend time with him, that is transferred to you. And it’s one of the most important things. And I don’t even know if I told him this. I have tears in my eyes thinking about it. And then I remember hanging out with him in Stockholm. He’s done phenomenal stuff with Spotify, one of the best apps ever created at best businesses. He’s wildly successful as an investor too. And so I remember asking him, this is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. And I go, “Were you always interested in investing?” Because I knew his story, we’ve talked a lot about this. And he goes, “No, I didn’t even know anything about it. I started learning.” I go, “When did you start learning?” He’s like, “2018.” I go, “How’d you start learning?” He goes, “Patrick’s podcast.” And so he would just listen to people. He’s like, “I like that idea, I’ll take that idea. Oh, I don’t like that idea, I don’t like that at all. I’ll avoid that.” And the way Patrick describes, it’s like out of anybody you know, Daniel has the ability to apply what he’s learning faster than anybody else, and at a grander scale. Tim Ferriss: I think he’s also a very, very, very good systems thinker. He is not at a risk cobbling together this sort of camel that is a horse designed by committee that has a bunch of inherent problems and conflicts within it. He’ll be able to figure out how to put pieces together from first principles that function well as a whole. David Senra: Let me tell one other piece of advice he gave me, and he tells it in a story form. This is why he is the wise old man, and essentially was, remember why people love you. You sit in a room and you read all the time, and then you make this thing on the other side that educates and inspires us and gives us energy. And as soon as you stop doing that and you start saying yes to all these distractions, and I don’t even know, I think we might’ve talked about this in the episode we did, that comes out in a few weeks, but he tells it in a story, and he tells a story from another person. So he’s not telling you, “David, go do this.” He’s like, “Let me tell you about this little genius,” or not little genius. “This guy’s really impressive. Look at what he’s accomplished and everything else.” And then the story will hit you hours later. And he’s like, “Oh, yeah, we’ve invited him to the conference over time. I’ve invited him to visit and I keep hearing no.” And I’m like, “Oh, he’s like telling me you’re saying yes to too many things.” The magic that you have is because you say no, and once you start saying yes, and you’re at every conference, you’re traveling around, you’re doing all this sort of stuff, the magic disappears. Tim Ferriss: I’m curious what you think are some of the different archetypes because I think of the 100 plus startups that I’ve invested in since 2008, and there’s a lot of variability. You’ve got the engineer, let’s call it the engineer founder, somebody like Tobi of Shopify or Luis von Ahn of Duolingo. Then you’ve got genius operator, negotiator warrior, like a Travis Kalanick, right? Very different personalities, very different superpowers. And you just go down the list and you see some people come from a finance, numbers, spreadsheet God perspective, and they just have an analytical advantage. It’s very comparable to investing in some ways, looking at the investing world. They have this analytical advantage, let’s just call it. And I was trying to pick out what, if anything, might be commonalities because you also have the crazy artists who then figures out how to harness some of their superpower. And it strikes me that there are at least two that immediately jumped to mind. One is longer term time horizon. David Senra: Those are the people I’m obsessed with. Tim Ferriss: Like the Jeff Bezos type of mindset where it’s like if you have the exact same toolkit, the exact same competency, out of the box genetically, you’re built exactly the same as someone else, but you are able to think and plan longer term, it can be a huge advantage. Second is something that you mentioned where Daniel was saying to you, “This is the magic.” Just remember this is the magic. When other opportunities, other shiny objects show up, because they will even in very early stages. And if you deviate, it’s incredibly easy to self-immolate if you lose track of that. You see that a lot when CEOs get replaced, sometimes, founder CEOs and sometimes they need to be replaced. But what else would you add to that or how would you expand on any of it?David Senra: Just look at the founders of some of the biggest companies in the world now, they would go to war against each other, so think about Oracle and Microsoft. You can’t think of two different founder archetypes than Bill Gates and Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison’s like, “I’m a sprinter. I have intense, very intense periods of work, weeks at a time, months at time, and then I need to go on my boat with a bunch of Italian models. This is how I have to live my life.” Bill Gates is, we’d be walking into this room right here, and his feet would be under the ground underneath his desk. He’s sleeping for three hours. He’s getting back up and he’s going back on the, he’s a grinder. And then you have, I’ve been trying to name some of these and I haven’t done this yet. And the problem is I never write anything, and this is all improv, but one of them was the anti-business billionaire. And so what I, in that category is these people are so obsessed about one thing and that’s the quality of the product that they’re making. They make non-financial decisions like Steve Jobs making sure that the inside of the Mac looks beautiful even though you can’t open it up and it costs more money. He doesn’t care. He wants the best product. James Dyson’s like this, he’s an anti-business billionaire. Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, anti-business billionaire. These guys, they’re obsessed with two things, quality of the product that they’re making and retaining control of their company over long term. And the funny part about this, the reason I call them anti-business billionaires is because if you make the world’s best product and you retain control over your company, you wind up with the money anyways. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I can think of a few people, I mean within my portfolio who retained a lot of their equity at least, and that’s it. Which is preserving the magic in terms of the best product. David Senra: Well look, everybody’s like, “Look at what’s happening to Larry Ellison right now.” It’s like, yeah, the guy I think they raised, I think this could be wrong, but I think Oracle raised 32 million of equity in their IPO and no more after that. And then the guy would refuse, even when they were almost going out of business in 1990, he still wouldn’t sell. They’re like, “Sell your equity.” Like, “No.” It might be worth nothing, he just wouldn’t sell it, and then he’s buying back stock. He owns, I think, 40, I think he went down to 24 percent, now he’s back to 41 percent of Oracle. The company’s 50 years old, 45 years old. I think he was 30-something when he founded the company. He’s just an anomaly. And then you have people like Elon where it’s just like, “I’m going to run.” I wouldn’t even think that’s possible, how the hell do you run seven companies at the same time? Tim Ferriss: I can barely manage three employees, I don’t know. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: I don’t have a good answer. David Senra: That is the point. I do think Daniel hit on something that no one else has put in front of me. It’s like, man, there’s not, the people are going to dominate. Obviously, Elon’s the most famous entrepreneur in the world, but even Bezos is very different. And then you have these people that some of the people just like to make money, and that is their scoreboard. This is another thing I learned from Michael Dell. There’s two things. One thing you just said: protecting the magic. The advice that Dell gave me when I had dinner with him, and he does this in story form too, because that guy’s been running his business for 41 years, 41 years. It’s insane. And his whole thing is just like, “You’re not going to be taken out by competition. You’re going to sabotage yourself.” “Entrepreneurs sabotage themselves, and the amount of people that were doing the same thing I was doing, and they were ahead of me.” This is Dell talking, “They were ahead of me, but then they got to 500 million year in revenue and they’re like, ‘I have a house on Lake Austin now.’” They’re in the same city. They’re doing the same thing as him in the same city, and they’re smoking them. They’re ahead of them by a few hundred million, and they’re like, “Oh, I can chill now.” No, you can’t, because you’ve got Michael Dell right across the river and he’s not going to chill. That guy has no chill. When I went to him, I was like, “What the?” I heard he’s got this wonderful house in Hawaii, his son was telling me about this, and we were in Austin in July. You know, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: It’s hot. David Senra: What are you doing here? And Michael’s answer is simple. He goes, “I love my business and my business is here.” He wasn’t being mean to me, he was like, “That’s a stupid question, David. I’m working. I love what I do, this is what I’m doing.” So one thing from his autobiography though is that really, I used to say it only works if you build a business that’s authentic to you. And this is why I asked you about your inner monologue earlier, because I really feel the reason people do their best work usually later in life, in business, is obviously more experienced network, finances, everything else, but I think because they know themselves better. I think me and you, if we would’ve met 10 years ago, we’d be different people and we also wouldn’t know each other. Know ourselves as much as we do now, where I think I’ve built a business and you have two based on what I know about you, completely authentic to you, and that’s the only way it’s going to work over long term. And I used to say authentic and Michael Dell’s autobiography, which he narrates by the way, the Audible’s excellent. I listened to it three times before I read it to do the episode on it. And there’s a guy named, I think Lee Walker who Michael brought in when Michael was 21. He was in his forties, and he was an older, wiser man, and he had to quit after four years. He was basically running the company with Michael. He’s like, “We’re fighting. We’re taking on IBM with a thousand dollars of working capital from a shitty office in the industrial part in Austin.” IBM’s the biggest company in the world. I didn’t know this, it was the first company to hit $100 billion market cap. “My back hurts. I’m losing hair, I can’t sleep. I got digestive issues.” Lee’s dead after four years. And he goes, “And Michael’s excited. It’s invigorated him,” and he gave me the line, he goes, “because he built a business that was natural to him. I’m dying and he’s thriving because it’s natural to him and it’s not natural to me.” And I think that’s the key, man. People are like, “Oh, I’m going to imitate X, Y, and Z.” It’s like, no, no, no. You should be copying the how, not the what. You don’t copy what they did, you copy how they did it, and then you just take the little ideas that make sense to you. So you ask, “How am I applying this for my own work?” I am either completely apathetic and ignore something or completely obsessed. It’s zero or 100 and nothing in the middle. So the reason I love Munger, because Munger gave me really — Munger and your friend Naval, had a big role in this too. Gave me the blueprint where he’s just like, “Hey, we found that…” Oftentimes Munger has this line that oftentimes the winning system in business goes ridiculously far, maximizing and/or minimizing one or a few variables. And he used Costco like the example, and then he has another line. “Find a simple idea and take it seriously.” Sharing lessons from biographies of great people is a very, very simple idea. Doing it for nine years, working 70 hours a week at it, building systems for it, redoing it over and over again is not — that’s the serious part. His other quote that I’ve already shared earlier, “There’s ideas worth billions in a $30 history book.” That’s another idea. That’s maybe why the work will be valuable and attract the audience that it could attract, another idea from him. You want to maneuver yourself into an area that you’re intensely interested in, that just being a fanatic, like a Sam Walton or a Jim Sinegal or a Sol Price is just — Jeff Bezos, very helpful. These are fanatics, they’re intensely interested in what they’re doing. That is worth a lot of money, and I’ve become friends with Michael Ovitz, who’s also one of the first guests on my new show. And his whole thing is like, you cannot fight against your job. That’s one of the best pieces of advice. He’s like, “People fight against their job all the time and they lose.” You have to find something that you’re intensely drawn to it. Tim Ferriss: So I have a couple of bullets. You should explain who Michael Ovitz is. Why don’t you do that first, and then I’ll just hop to two questions related to Michael Ovitz specifically. David Senra: Michael Ovitz is a shark. He’s one of the most intense people. I think he’s 80 by now. So Rick and I live very close to each other in Miami, and we always have breakfast at the same spot that I’m not going to say publicly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, good idea. David Senra: And so we’re hanging out — Tim Ferriss: The disinformation campaign. Yeah, it’s always at Denny’s. Moons Over My Hammy. David Senra: So his phone is on the table and it rings and it says “Michael Ovitz” and I gasped. I’m like, “Oh,” I read — everybody knows who Michael — Michael Ovitz was the most powerful man in Hollywood at one time. He had like 75 percent market share, 90 percent market share. He was the most powerful agent. He’s the founder of CAA, which still exists to this day. And I’m like, “Oh, God, I know who that is. I’ve done episodes of this guy.” And so he picks up and they’ve been friends for 20 years, 25 years, something like that. And he goes, “Hey, I’m sitting here with somebody you might know. Have you ever heard of David Senra and the Founders podcast?” And Michael pauses, he goes, “I listened to four of them yesterday.” He was on his boat in St. Barts. Tim Ferriss: That’s incredible. David Senra: No, but this is how — he’s a shark and a killer. He’s on his boat in St. Barts, he’s like studying Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. He’s quoting stuff from the episode and so, we wind up having dinner. Tim Ferriss: Rockefeller, one of the biggest sharks to ever live. David Senra: 100 percent. And so we wound up having dinner, and this is one of the things I asked him, because his whole thing is going to run through — you’re going to meet thousands of people in your life. He’s going to definitely meet way more people than I will, because I’m an introvert. And he used to call 300 people a day, because he was kind of running Hollywood. Ovitz’s advice to me was just like, “You’re going to meet thousands of people in your life, and what I would recommend is just spend all the time with a handful that really matter.” And he’s like, “For me, Rick is one of those people.” And I go, “Why?” And obviously, he’s like, “Well, he’s intelligent,” basically. But he’s like, “Because he tells me the truth.” Tim Ferriss: That is one thing you can definitely reply. That’s one thing you can rely on Rick for. David Senra: But in general — Tim Ferriss: Not sure he can help himself. Not sure it’s a conscious decision. David Senra: No, but in general, his whole point is when you get to be as famous and as well-known, as wealthy as Ovitz, everybody is going to kiss your ass. Everybody wants something from you. They won’t either want to tell you how great you are, or they want money from you, or they want you to sell, buy something. And you’re just like, there’s so few people that you know that truly love you for you and don’t want anything from you. They just want to be friends. And they will tell you the truth. And this is the very dangerous thing that really successful people do. They surround themselves with people that don’t tell them the truth. And this is an idea I got from Jim Casey, the founder of UPS. He realized that there’s this weird capture if you only talk to your top executives, so let’s say you have 10 top executives, and then they distribute everything else to the company. They work themselves in a position where they have the ear of the king and you hear nothing good. So he’s like, “I don’t want to talk to them at all.” He would stop and talk to every single — he’d make his driver stop every single time they see a brown truck. And he would talk to the people doing the actual service. Tim Ferriss: Because he wouldn’t get the bad news or they would — David Senra: They would tell them what actually is going on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: What is actually happening? And the crazy impressive founders that I’ve been able to spend a lot of time with, most of them are 60, 70, 80 years old. Those are my favorite. I love them. They’re not in their office. They’re in their warehouses. They’re on the factory line. They’re in their stores. They’re in constant contact with the customer and the person delivering the service to the customer. Not with their — they’re not looking at a whiteboard with their executives. They’re very practical, non-theoretical people. I think it’s really important. So yeah, I think in my own thing, it’s just like I like to be obsessed and focus on one thing. I don’t like to multitask. So therefore everybody is like every single publisher. It’s like, “Write a book, you should do this.” I’m like, everybody says, “Hey, I like X, so do Y.” And I’m like, “But then if I do Y, I don’t do X.” And so my whole thing is just very simple. I want to do one thing relentlessly. Tim Ferriss: So related to Michael Ovitz, there are a few notes here that I think relate to the new show and the interview you did with him. And I want to ask about two of them. So the first is the benefits of low introspection. And the second — so you can tackle these in either order is “this can’t be my life,” in quotation marks, is a powerful motivator. Can you expand on those?David Senra: So “This can’t be my life” is a very powerful motivator. You see it over and over again. I think the sense of drive, the way you grew up on Long Island, the way I grew up, I was like, “I’m not going out like this.” I don’t care what I have to do — Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to replay this movie. David Senra: No way. I think in many cases, seeing examples of what you don’t want your life to be is more powerful than seeing what you want it to be. I think maybe that one comes first and then, you start to see, “Oh, actually this is the path I want to go down.” Tim Ferriss: There’s an expression in Japanese, which is [foreign language] is like opposite side. [foreign language] is teacher and it’s someone who teaches you by showing you what not to do. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right. David Senra: Yeah. I would say my family definitely the case — Tim Ferriss: One of those. David Senra: Yeah, you just see this over and over again. And so with him, he grew up in the valley. He could see where he wanted to be. He could see the mansions of Beverly Hills. He saw the contrast between, “This is what I’m worried about with social media.” It’s like before we grew up, what do you see? You basically see, “Oh, that’s the nice neighborhood over there. That’s kind of a bad neighborhood.” Now you see the richest people in the world every day and the poorest people in the world, you’re exposed to nothing but extremes, which is like we’ve never — in human history, we’ve never been exposed to that. And what is the long-term effects of that? I have a teenage daughter now, and I think there’s a lot of negativity of this like, you only see the most beautiful people. If you were just in a town where we grew up, you might see a really beautiful woman. You’re not seeing them all day long. It’s just this unfair — Tim Ferriss: Barrage. David Senra: Yeah, barrage of unattainable standards. So with him, he was fiercely driven to succeed. And one of my favorite parts of his book, the guy now, wildly successful, but even before that, he left, I think it was William Morris Agency, he starts CAA, they started to have a little success. He winds up buying a house in Brentwood and it was like $650,000, which is fantastic, but nothing compared to what’s going to happen over the next decades in his life. But he just woke up every morning, he’s like, “I can’t believe I live in Brentwood.” “I can’t believe this. I did this.” And then once you start seeing results, the grind becomes very addictive. And he, if you had, what’s his archetype, grinder. I’m going to throw sheer hours and energy. He’s also an amazing — one of the best salespeople alive, very charismatic. He’s got a lot of superpowers. I actually met Marc Andreessen. I asked him this because Marc Andreessen is on record saying that when he started a16z, they essentially copied CAA. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I think they brought Michael Ovitz in. David Senra: They did. They both talk about this. And I asked him, I go, “What do you think is Michael’s superpower?” He’s like, “He’s the world’s greatest agent and therefore the greatest salesperson, the world’s greatest salesperson.” And so that’s one example from his book is just like, this can’t be my life. I don’t want to be like this. I’m going to direct all my energy and do something different. Now the low introspection thing is I’m not a controversial person. I’m just sharing lessons from history that I read in a book. You don’t have to listen, you don’t have to pay attention, it doesn’t matter. But when I bring up the fact that a lot of these people have low or zero introspection. Meaning that when they find what they want to do in life, they wake up and they know exactly what they’re doing that day. Sam Walton was not waking up saying, “What are my feelings like today? What should I do? Should I think about the meaning of life?” He’s like, “No, I founded Walmart. I made one Walmart. I’m going to make another one and another one and another one. I will make every Walmart better and better and better.” And I think having low introspection after you found your mission in life — and this is a sad thing, I think most people never find their mission. I know I found my mission. I don’t think about what should I do today. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to talk, obviously, about the new show and we’ve been alluding to it and mentioning some of the guests. But before we get there — so you’re about to meet Michael and he had been ostensibly on vacation, but he’s listening to your episodes on Rockefeller and others. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Do you recall any of the other episodes? David Senra: The Vanderbilt one stuck up in my mind. I mean, we text about them. I don’t remember — the Vanderbilt is the one that really — the Rockefeller and the Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt especially because Vanderbilt is like — what I say is I’m kind of telling the same story over and over again. I think it’s more like church than it is like — just like I went to church. I grew up as a fundamentalist Christian. We met together with believers on regular intervals on Wednesday and Sunday. And it’s not like the preacher got up there and was like, “Hey, we talked about that Jesus guy enough, we’re going to move on to somebody else.” It’s like we literally just go to the same book over and over again. And so I always say there’s always a historical equivalent to anybody we’re dealing with today or in the past. But Vanderbilt, to me — there’s not an entrepreneurial historical equivalent. He’s like Putin or something. When he died, he controlled five percent of the money supply. So one out of $25. Tim Ferriss: So I guess the reason I was asking about the episodes, and I don’t know Michael, so this is not a judgment or criticism of Michael at all, but I suppose if you believe that there is a value to low introspection for the purposes of building a business, which I would agree. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is there not a risk, and I have not listened to those particular episodes on Rockefeller and Vanderbilt, but I’ve read a bit of the history. These are not necessarily people you automatically want to model everything in all — David Senra: No, I think Ovitz would. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So this is I suppose my question. Is there a risk of ending up amoral, immoral or sociopathic, if you — one of the things you optimize for is low introspection because — or maybe that’s just hardwiring frankly, and you’re just not inclined to do it. David Senra: That’s a good question. Tim Ferriss: Because this archetype does exist, just like the rape, pillage, destroy archetype is an archetype. David Senra: They’re overrepresented in entrepreneurship. Why? Because, if entrepreneurship [is] done correctly, [it yields] the greatest material rewards in human history. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: So of course, it’s going to be full of psychopaths and sociopaths. Whatever — I don’t know if you know the numbers on this, but they assume five percent of the population’s sociopathic or something like that. Is that something like that? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know the numbers. David Senra: Let’s just make it up. It’s five percent of the general population. It’s probably five times that of entrepreneurs and investors and people like this or anybody — political power. Power in general. This is why I think the work of Robert Caro is so interesting. And I always make the argument that there should only — there should be a law. The only one law that I would foist upon society is that there’s only one person allowed to write a thousand-page biography. I have no problem reading that. Almost none of the books that I’ve read that are a thousand pages needed to be a thousand pages. They just didn’t know what to put in there. Robert Caro is the only one that should be able to write long biographies because everything that he has in there should be in there. I think he’s a master of his craft. He’s the best to ever do it. But he’s saying, “I’m not writing biographies. I’m writing about how humans accumulate and then wield power. And I did it first on a local level in New York with Robert Moses, and now I’m showing what happens on a national level. And guess what, LBJ would sacrifice everything to get what he wanted. Personal ethics, his relationships, everything.” Tim Ferriss: Stealing elections. David Senra: This is the wonderful thing about studying history. History doesn’t repeat, human nature does. So if you just read Will and — and you both love Will and Ariel Durant, right? Read the history of human civilization. Read their hundred-page book, Lessons of History. The same stuff repeats over and over again. So when it comes out and you see this on the news, “Oh, of course no one stole the election.” It’s like stealing every election in all different countries. Stealing the elections is an American pastime. Just read Robert Caro. And it could be a little Senate election in Texas. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. David Senra: If you don’t think — Tim Ferriss: That missing ballot box. David Senra: Yeah. The line I have about this is from Will Durant, where he’s just like, “In every age, humans are dishonest and governments are corrupt.” It’s one of my favorite quotes from Lessons of History, and every age, nothing that we’re doing is new. We’re telling the same stories over and over and over again. You see the same people over and over again. So yeah, I’m sure there’s a ton of people that read these biographies and that listen to my podcast that are absolute psychopaths. I don’t think Ovitz is a psychopath. He’s an extreme winner. He wants to win. Tim Ferriss: The line may be pretty thin. David Senra: Yeah, of course. Of course. Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying he is, by the way, sociopath. It’s just that, just like you were mentioning, you can convince yourself of a bad idea, very compellingly, just as you can a good idea. It’s like when you start to get into the gray waters of morality as winning compounds upon winning, oftentimes the person who cares less about other people wins. If they can discard that consideration. David Senra: 100 percent, and that’s been true in the past. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: True today, will be true.That’s the point, that this is why it’s so interesting. You have to — I look at this as almost — I think something I didn’t even understand is I have the ability to step outside of myself, and I’m kind of like a casual observer of human nature. Tim Ferriss: I want to ask you, and then I’m going to hop to questions about podcasting on the new show, about how you think about assessing leaders, entrepreneurs, reading biographies or autobiographies, and figuring out what people claim as things that help them succeed, to succeed, actually help them versus hindering them. In other words, what are the “because of” versus the “in spite of?” So for instance, if high disagreeability or low agreeability is common across a lot of founders. To what extent is that — can you point to that as one of the causal factors for their success as opposed to just an emergency break they had on, causing all sorts of problems that they managed to overcome, so they succeeded despite. How do you think about separating those two things? David Senra: So one of the things I love about James Dyson, who is a hero of mine, it’s the person that on the planet that I want to meet that I haven’t met. The number one is him. And what I love about him is how stubborn he is, because I see myself in that. And it turns out his stubbornness worked out for him because he had the right idea, but this is where it goes back to like you can’t blindly copy. There’s no formula. There’s no formula, there’s no track. So it’s like he’s stubborn on an idea that was a great idea, it just needed more time. You could be stubborn on an idea that’s terrible and going nowhere. And then you did the exact same thing for the exact same amount of time. And on the other side of that, he has one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world, and you have a miserable life. There’s no answers to that. There’s nobody coming to save you. None of this shit works if you can’t trust your own judgment and figure things out. That’s why when people are like, “Oh, more people should be entrepreneurs.” I don’t know about that. I want to encourage the people that think they can do it, to do it. But I think in many cases, most people should work, like they should choose a different path because it’s very, very risky. Like Todd Graves, the Raising Cane’s guy I told you about, right? His whole thing is entrepreneurs should have higher risk tolerance. James Dyson, multiple times, risked every single possession he had to chase his dream. He signed over his house multiple times. If he failed, they could have been homeless. It worked out for him. Todd Graves had this crazy way to finance the first 28 Raising Cane’s where essentially he goes to an angel investor, he goes to Tim Ferriss and says, “Hey, you’re going to give me a 200,000 loan, okay? It’s going to be subjugated loan to the bank. I’m going to guarantee you a 15 percent return on the $200,000 for X amount of time.” You say, “Oh, that sounds great. You’re paying me 15 percent on my 200 grand.” But you don’t get any equity. I take that 200,000 equity that I have from this document from Tim. I go to a bank and say, “This is as collateral. Loan me the other 600 grand or whatever the number is to get this up and running.” And he did that for 28 times and he’s like, “Oh, I’m rolling, rolling, rolling.” Leveraged up to his eyeballs. What’s the problem? “I open up. Every time I open a new Raising Cane’s, there’s a line out the door from day one.” Well, then a little thing called Hurricane Katrina comes and guess where? 28 of his restaurants are all in Louisiana, and he almost died, and he says, “If I didn’t come out of that, there would be no story. It’d be gone.” And then I guess the second part of — I don’t know why this popped into my mind, but when you’re reading history, we’re reading about stories that happened a hundred years ago, 200 years ago, 50 years ago. Some of them are from that person’s own mouth. Like, imagine if you tell your own life story, you’re going to, here’s the good part. You’re going to hide the bad. You’re human, right? And so people are like, “Well, how do you know if what you’re reading is true?” The line is like if you think the news is fake, wait till you read history. Tim Ferriss: It’s just old news. David Senra: I don’t know. My idea is we’re not taking a test at the end of this. I’m not saying did this actually happen in 1912. It’s like, is the idea behind what he’s doing a good idea for me? And so the example of Rockefeller that you see that Elon used, where Rockefeller tells the story, I don’t know if it actually happened, but he tells the story where they would have to solder closed the barrels that they transport oil in, and he goes up one day and he says, “How many drops of solder do you use?” He’s like, “I use 40.” He’s like, “Have you ever tried 38?” He’s like, “No, we never tried 38.” “Can you try 38?” They tried 38, it leaks. “Okay, try 39.” They tried 39, doesn’t leak. That one drop of solder at the time of the business saved him $2,500 a year, the business grows and compounds for the next three decades, and now he’s saving like hundreds of thousands from that then. Did that actually happen? I don’t know. But that’s a good idea to find the limit, to actually, “Hey, maybe I should control my costs a little more. Maybe I need to actually see if I can do this in a more efficient way.” I don’t know if it happened. I just want the idea behind it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, just to reiterate what you’re saying, it’s tough to separate the fact from fiction, right? And then sometimes this is actually why I just read fiction because I’m like, “There still are truths to extract,” right? There are principles that you can extract from, this is now cliched because it’s been made into a popular movie, but Dune or Stranger in a Strange Land. You can actually pull a lot from just straight-up fiction. And then when it comes to the business side, because I’ve read so many, not as many as you, but tons of business books, still have my early copies and my notes from those books with Losing my Virginity, Richard Branson, early Yvon Chouinard, I think it’s Let My People Go Surfing, et cetera, still have all those books, and when you look at — part of the reason also that I like early biographies, so let’s just say like Hard Drive first on Bill Gates versus a later, I don’t want to say sanitized, but let’s say sanitized version where — David Senra: I’m going through this right now, where it’s like, look — Tim Ferriss: Warren Buffett, love the guy, and he’s turned himself into the “Awww, shucks” grandpa neighbor who takes his garbage out in a robe. David Senra: Killer. Killer. Tim Ferriss: He’s a killer, and I remember reading, I think it was The Making of an American Capitalist way back in the day, and the story that stuck out, and I hope I’m not inventing this, I don’t see why I would, but his routine was to go home, walk upstairs, and read. David Senra: Step over his children. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Was it his son — David Senra: Yes. Step over — Tim Ferriss: — who had fallen down the stairs, is sprawled out like a chalk outline at a crime scene, steps over his injured son to go upstairs to do more reading of S1 filings or whatever he was doing. David Senra: You bring up something interesting. This is why I don’t believe them when they say they have regrets at the end of their life. So if I read Making of an American Capitalist, an excellent book. I think that’s actually the best biography. Tim Ferriss: It’s so good. David Senra: You read Snowball after his wife leaves him and he says, “The biggest mistake, if I could go back and live life again, the biggest mistake I would do is I would change whatever I need, so” — I think her name was Susie — “didn’t leave me.” No, I don’t believe you. Tim Ferriss: I don’t buy it. David Senra: No, none of them. When they all say — like a Leonardo Del Vecchio, the guy that started Luxottica. I think I had it translated from Italian. Some of these biographies are in different languages so, again, go back to differentiation, what can I do that no one else is doing, we’ve translated the Red Bull book from German. Tim Ferriss: It was awesome. I listened to that. David Senra: I appreciate that.But he gets to the end of his life, he is an orphan. Dad dies young — Tim Ferriss: What was the company again? David Senra: Luxottica. So they essentially — Tim Ferriss: [inaudible]. David Senra: Monopolize glasses, everything. So Mark Zuckerberg just invested, I think, three and a half billion dollars for like three percent of the company. Tim Ferriss: Wow. David Senra: And so for essentially 60 years, he just a slow, methodical Rockefeller-esque march through the entire industry until he controls every single component of eyeglasses, sunglasses, everything. It’s like completely dominant. He gets to the end of his life, he’s just like, “Oh, yeah. The one regret I have is…” He’s married multiple times. I think there’s like a 50-year gap between his oldest son and his youngest son. So it’s like he’s like a wild boy, but he’s like, “The one regret I have is I didn’t spend more time with my kids.” No, you wouldn’t change a thing. Tim Ferriss: It’s not true. David Senra: It’s not true because I don’t think they could. That’s what where you just said. It’s like maybe they didn’t have a choice. Maybe it’s just hardwired. And so I’m going through that literally right now because this week I read Source Code which is Bill Gates’ autobiography about the first 20 years of his life, his version. I reread Hard Drive, Overdrive, which is also written by the same guys that wrote Hard Drive, and then I pulled all my highlights and notes for Paul Allen’s description of Bill Gates in Paul Allen’s autobiography. There is a vast difference between what’s in Source Code and what is in Hard Drive, and it’s obviously Hard Drive is more accurate. It’s written right after it happened. Bill is not the 70-year-old man he is now, and he’s in a different world, but watch his interviews, watch the documentary on Netflix about him. He’s like, “I was hardcore. That was my advantage.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. David Senra: He was. Tim Ferriss: Killer. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And also these questions, a lot of the questions that I ask myself when I’m reading any nonfiction — I shouldn’t say any nonfiction, let’s say biographies where I’m hoping to model something. One is like is, or an autobiography, okay, what’s the bias here. Are there any particular biases I should be aware of, okay? Is anyone in like reputation rehab mode before they die? Okay, let’s keep that. David Senra: Sure. Tim Ferriss: What type of survivorship bias might there be, right? Who tried the same? Do we have 99 out of 100 who tried something similar and failed? Let’s take a look at the tape. Okay. Luck is luck. Luck’s everywhere, right? So the fact that Bill Gates ended up with a computer, winding it up with the computers, it’s just like it’s, yeah. David Senra: Timing. I think timing. Tim Ferriss: Timing is a huge piece. By the way, these are not all reasons to discount anything, but I just want to mention a couple of that I try to think of. The other I try to think of, because I might try to mimic someone in sports if I’m trying to learn something, or language learning or whatever it might be, is what are attributes, what is trainable and what is not trainable, right? Because I’ve heard these stories from people who know Bill Gates and they’re like, “Well, we were going to go on this short vacation in…” fill in the blank, I can’t remember, Costa Rica, right? They’re going to go on a birding trip in the morning. It’s just like a two, three-hour thing with a world-class birding guide. They do the trip, and the night before, Bill has stayed up and read five books on birding, memorized them seemingly without trying, and is basically having like a peer-to-peer discussion with the birding expert as they’re going through the rainforest. That’s not normal. David Senra: No. It’s not. Tim Ferriss: That’s like “I’m going to do calf raises to make my body look like Michael Phelps.” No, you’re not. That’s not going to work. So it’s like when I’m looking for people to model, I’m trying to find people who have hopefully a comparable composition of strengths that I can amplify in myself or that are coachable, right? And so the question after all that is, does anyone stand out to you, of the biographies or people you’ve met, where you’re like in terms of someone doing the most with the hand they’ve been dealt — so maybe they’re not a freak of nature. David Senra: So not aliens. Tim Ferriss: They’re not a freak of nature, necessarily, because there are freaks of nature among the people that you study, the people I study, but it’s like, all right, these people might have a few strengths, but they’re not complete freaks. They’re not the Usain Bolts of — fill in the blank, and man, oh, man, did they play their hand well. They’re just so good at playing the hands that they are dealt, that person. Does anybody stick out? David Senra: Sam Walton. Tim Ferriss: All right. David Senra: Sam Walton’s one of my favorite entrepreneurs. If you really think about it, so he had this crazy thing, this crazy idea. I don’t think he obviously didn’t know what Walmart was going to turn into, but one of the ways they avoided all the inheritance tax is if you give away the equity before it’s valuable. The last time I checked, if you look at all of the Walmart equity owned by the family, that means the wealth that came from his idea, it would be like 432 billion today if it was consolidated in one person, right? When you study Sam, he’s obviously smart, but he was just like, he didn’t really know what he was going to do. Then he had this idea, he’s like, “Well, maybe I can be good at retailing.” And then he starts out in Newport, Arkansas with one store. This is what drives me insane about the modern day entrepreneurship industry is how everybody, they start out with like weird goals, like “I’m going to build a trillion-dollar company,” or “I’m going to be the fastest person to a hundred million ARR,” and you’re just like, “Okay, but none of these people talk like that. You’re doing it for the wrong reason, so you probably won’t get there if that’s just the case.” It’s like what Jerry Seinfeld says, “If you’re just doing it for money, you only get so far.” With him, he was just fascinated by stores and trying to make it a little bit better every day, and he spends — Tim Ferriss: It was on vacation, right? Didn’t matter where he was, he would go into a retail store — David Senra: His kids told the story. It’s just like vacation was essentially driving to different towns and checking out different retailers. The most important thing about his story, one of the most important things, is this idea to go slow now so you can go faster later. And so you’re like, “Okay.” The beginning of his career, he’s in one tiny store. I think they start doing 25,000 a year. 25,000 a year in revenue, and I think he gets up to like 250 grand. It took him five years. But for five years he just had one story. It was like experimenting, understanding, trying to figure out what the different parts of retail are because there’s no such thing as discounting and wholesaling and all this other stuff that he was doing that he’s going to do later on. And then what’s fascinating is later in his career after Walmart, he then takes that idea, he goes and visits Sol Price, who we mentioned earlier, he takes that idea. He’s like, “Oh, this is a great idea. I’m going to do this.” He does Sam’s Club. In that same five-year period, so you have the first five years, one store, separated by maybe 40 years in the career, that second five years when he’s starting something else, in that five-year period he doesn’t have one store. He winds up doing, I think, a hundred stores and like seven billion in revenue from this new category because you see him learning. And so, yes, I think he was brilliant, but he’s not memorizing five books overnight in doing that. This is like mine, I don’t think — man, one of the reasons that I do what I do is because Munger became a hero and he talks over and over again about being a biography nut, that he read more biographies than anybody else. I got to spend three hours inside of his house talking to him right before he died. I don’t care how many biographies I read, how many books I read for the rest of my life, I cannot have a brain like him. I will never have a brain like him. Anybody at 99 is going to have some level of cognitive decline. You know what one of my first thoughts was about an hour and a half into the conversation with him was, “This guy had to be terrifying when he was 60.” Terrifying. Terrifying. Think about this. Everybody that I know, when I get to meet fancy people I always ask them, “Who’s the smartest person you know? What’s the best business you know?” It can’t be like Apple. It’s like these interesting, weird things, and every single person that says — if they know Buffett and they don’t tell you it’s Buffett, they’re wrong. Buffett chose this guy to let him mold and shape his thinking. What does that tell you about his intelligence? I remember — because this is what I do, again, I’m like laying bricks every day. I don’t think I’m a brilliant person. I just show up every day and don’t quit. And so I read. Once I find Munger, I read, literally, not, oh, I read some of the books, I read every single book on Munger. Then I reread my highlights over and over again. So my days, I wake up, work out, read for a few hours, have lunch, then reread past highlights in the afternoon. All my social media posts are just me rereading highlights. I read every single book on Munger, then I reread all the highlights, but then I read all the books he tells me to read, because he’ll tell you, “Read Les Schwab.” He’ll tell you all these things. He’ll tell you Henry Kaiser. I was like, “Who the hell is Henry Kaiser?” Henry Kaiser started a hundred companies. He built the Hoover Dam. He built Liberty ships. I go, “What?” Tim Ferriss: By the way, just the fact that pretty much everyone listening to this podcast will have no idea of who that person is just underscores, I think, how ridiculous it is to get overly fixated on legacy as an excuse for all sorts of behaviors. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Nobody’s going to remember you. David Senra: No. I’m anti-legacy and I’m anti-family dynasty. I think bequeathing your kids a bunch of wealth is — well, that’s another story for another day. Tim Ferriss: But okay, a hundred companies. Right. Hoover Dam, which, by the way, was made in, what, like eight years or 12 years. I mean, some insane time span. David Senra: Crazy. So first of all, I’m freaked out. I’m there, it’s me, two other young entrepreneurs in their 30s, and they had both met Charlie before. And then I’m like 10 minutes in and I’m just like, “Ugh.” I just couldn’t believe what’s happening to me. I’m like, “That’s fucking Charlie Munger over there.” And then you know he’s looking at you, because he’s blind, and so if he’s looking at you like this, he’s not looking at you. He’s got to go like this and this because then he’s got to look through his glasses. So you know when he’s looking at you. And then my friend looks at me, he’s like, “Get in here. Do something.” I literally sat there. Me not speaking for 10 minutes, it’s really hard for me to do. There’s a reason I do monologue podcasts. So then I see we’re in his library, so then I’m like, “Oh, this is my savior,” because I’ve read all those books behind him because he told me to read them. And so this is why I said it doesn’t matter what I do, and this will answer your question a long way. I start asking questions about Henry Kaiser and all these books, and he knows the revenue, he knows the partner, he knows how the business ended, he knows the mistakes they made. And then I go, “Charlie, when’s the last time you read these books?” And he’s like, “15 years ago.” And then I go, when we’re shifting from the library to dinner, I was like, “Charlie, can I go through your library?” He’s like, “Of course.” He’s just sitting in his chair and I’m going through the books and I open them. No notes. Tim Ferriss: Different stock. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, different stock. Oh, my God. So, all right, we are going to get to the things I promised, but I have to ask you. So in addition to smartest person, best business, what are some of your other go-to questions when you meet the fancy folks? David Senra: So who’s the smartest person you know? What’s the best business you know? I actually got to spend some time with Eddie Lampert. So Eddie Lampert at one time was thought to be the next Buffett, and he was mentored by Richard Rainwater, and I find Richard Rainwater really fascinating because Richard Rainwater has probably — Tim Ferriss: Great man too. David Senra: Oh, excellent. Richard, first of all there’s no biographies on him. He died rather young. He probably created more billionaire investors in America than any other person in direct mentorship. Eddie broke the record, I think in like the ’80s or’ 90s for the most taxable income made by an American, and he was super young. And so Eddie lives in Miami and I was at his house. Tim Ferriss: He was like, “Never again. I’m moving to Miami.” David Senra: No, no. No, no. So that might be one of the best investments because he probably paid $12 million for his house and his house will probably sell for 150 million today because it’s on the island that Bezos lives on, and the house is beautiful. Tim Ferriss: I’m sure he won’t even notice it on his balance sheet or in his life. David Senra: He’s much more out of the spotlight now. But again, he’s one of these older guys, just very, very wise and very quiet. He’s like me. He’s introverted. You go to his house, there’s just books everywhere. He’s got this insane yacht that I went on called the Fountainhead. I’ll let people google it. It is insane. Tim Ferriss: I mean, great name too. David Senra: Yeah, but same thing. You go on the boat and you go on the boat, dude, and it’s full of books. It’s the weirdest — Tim Ferriss: Ran out of room at his house, so had to buy a super yacht for the books. David Senra: It’s the weirdest unintended hack ever to build a world-class network of just read a bunch of history and they’ll come get you. They’re like — I’ve never sent a cold DM in my life, ever. I’ve never sent a cold email in my life. Tim Ferriss: All, right. So what do you have? Why did Lampert come? You’re asking him questions. David Senra: I’m asking these questions, right? Basically, and they’re not mean to me. He’s like, “Yeah, but there’s better questions you can ask.” I was like, “Okay, tell me what they are.” And so his answers are, like the smartest person, he’s like, “Well, I spent a bunch of time with Buffett.” I go, “Okay.” He goes, “It’s obviously Buffett.” He goes, “There’s actually more interesting…” And then who’s the best investor, that was another question I asked. He goes, “There’s actually a more interesting question that you’re not asking.” I go, “What’s that?” He goes, “Who’s the best dealmaker?” Tim Ferriss: Mm. Mm-hmm. That’s a great one. David Senra: And I go, “I don’t know what that means.” I don’t know anything about investing. The question I’ve asked Rick and Patrick, they probably think I’m retarded. You can edit that question out, edit that word out. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s fine. David Senra: But they’re just like, “What is wrong with this guy?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. We didn’t even get to — I mean, I would say Brad Jacobs would fit in sort of the dealmaker. Or Zell. David Senra: Yeah. But yeah, but his is like a different — so, okay, this is very fascinating what Eddie said. So again, Eddie, you can go back and read profiles of him. He was like a boy wonderkid. Rick told me a funny story. They used to all be at the same golf club in New Jersey, and Richard Rainwater walked in, and Rick’s like a young kid and Rainwater’s a legend, and he’s making conversation with him. He goes, “We just wait, the best investor in the America’s going to walk through that door.” And Rick goes, “Buffett?” And it was Eddie. So anyways, Eddie’s like, “There’s a better question that you’re not asking.” I was like, “All right. Well, you’re way smarter than I am, tell me.” He goes, “Who’s the best dealmaker?” I don’t know what that means. He goes, “Well, an investor is judged on ROIC, return on invested capital.” He goes, “The two best dealmakers I ever knew were Richard Rainwater and David Geffen.” So the thing about David Geffen, he’s super underrated. He’s another person I’d like to spend time with if I could, is it’s one thing to have a bunch of money. It’s another thing to have a bunch of money and be liquid. There is a line in this profile on Larry Gagosian that I read that says, “Any time there’s a downturn…” Larry Gagosian’s maybe the most successful art dealer in the world. Art soars during great economic times and kind of doesn’t do so well in other times. Any time there was a dip and they needed to make money, they’d call David because they said David is as liquid as the day is long. David gave a 26-year-old Eddie Lampert like 200 million of his own money to run. So David’s just like liquid. Tim Ferriss: Staked him. David Senra: And so he goes, “David is a crazy dealmaker.” He goes — Tim Ferriss: I guess he didn’t stake him. He was an LP. David Senra: I don’t think it was a fund structure. I think it was, “Here’s 200, make it bigger.” Tim Ferriss: Make it bigger. David Senra: I don’t think he’s going to be like, “You make money if I make money.” I don’t think it was a permanent structure, which is interesting. Sam Zell never had a permanent structure. There’s actually a lot of them. I find those more interesting. But anyways, I was like, “Okay, so why is Richard Rainwater one of the best dealmakers?” He’s like, “Because with Richard it was all returns, no capital.” I was like, “What?” He goes, “Richard maneuvered himself into such an influential position in the American economy because of who he knew, and him being involved in your deal immediately made it more valuable that people just gave him the equity.” All returns, no capital. That was like one of my favorite ideas that I’ve ever heard. Yeah, and he would just tell amazing stories. He told me a story where Richard, when he mentors you — like, he recruited Eddie. Eddie was living in New York, working at Goldman Sachs, if I remember correctly. He convinced him to move to Fort Worth, Texas. Have you ever been to Fort Worth? Tim Ferriss: I have. David Senra: Okay. I’ve been there too. There’s nothing there, and in the ’80s there was less than nothing there. This kid moves there, they would travel together, and Eddie said that Richard would want to summer somewhere in Massachusetts, and it was like this 20-room hotel that was members only, so it’s not open to the random public, and he insisted that Eddie be put in the room next to him. One day, a bunch of guys knock on Eddie’s door while he’s in the room supposed to be working and researching, and they come in with a bunch of tools. He’s like, “What are you doing?” He’s like, “Richard wants us to put a hole in this wall.” Richard didn’t want to go in the hallway and walk around to Eddie’s room. So he made them knock a hole and then install a door so he could just go. He could have direct access to Eddie just with a door that didn’t exist. Tim Ferriss: That’s incredible. David Senra: He just had all kinds of crazy stories. Tim Ferriss: All right, so not Buffett, not Munger, smartest person. David Senra: That I met? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, smartest person. Let’s revise that and just say if you could pick one person you’ve met to be your coach/Yoda. David Senra: Oh, Daniel Ek. Tim Ferriss: Daniel Ek. David Senra: Easily. Tim Ferriss: All right. That was fast. Okay. David Senra: Well, again, Brad Jacobs gives me great advice. Michael Dell would give me great advice, like Todd Graves, but this guy is around my age. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. David Senra: It’s like the gap between us is so obvious when you solve for that, and again, I just think of the stuff he does, his clarity of thought. I greatly admire the product. I like products. I guess we should back up what is actually important to you. I don’t actually give a shit how much money you have. I know a lot of people, and I love these, we’re in New York right now, some of my favorite people. I like the PE guys way more than I like the VC guys because they’re just more honest. The PE guys are like, they have great lines about this, they go, “VC gets all the attention, PE gets all the money.” And then they’re like, “The VCs are lying because they say the founders are the customers. No, the LPs are our customers. The founders didn’t give you any money.” Then the PE guys are just honest. Why do you wake up every day? To maximize the value of my LP dollars. I don’t want to play that game. I don’t want to play it at all, but I respect — their honesty is refreshing. Their scoreboard is, “I have $6 billion and I’ll be better if I have eight.” I am obsessed with product. The fact that I work on my podcast for seven days a week, the fact that I hand-edit the transcript, the fact that I do — like MrBeast drives me — he’s like, “You’re stupid. Somebody can edit. Basically you need an editor. You need all these other things.” I just am obsessed. It’s like you don’t work all your life to do what you love to not do it. I don’t want to outsource stuff. I like the craft of making the product. I’m very proud — like when Spotify Wrapped, some people might, because it’s embarrassing. When my Spotify Wrapped comes out this year, the number one podcast on that is going to be my own. I go back and listen to it. One, I think of it as a tool, right? I was on a treadmill in Malibu a few weeks ago listening to episode 221, which I think is the biography of Charlie Munger. I say to Charlie Munger all the time, “We forget how much we forget.” I listened to this hour-long podcast, like, oh, God, he’s got a lot of great ideas that I forgot. I’m not doing it because I like to hear the sound of my own voice. I also do it because do you think Kobe watched game tape? How am I going to get better if I don’t — when I interviewed Michael Dell, really more of a conversation than an interview, but I listened to the Michael Dell episode that I just did a few months ago, and all I hear is the flaws. All I hear is like, “You stupid idiot. You should use three sentences, that could have been one sentence. That is not even interesting. Cut that next time.” That’s how I get better. I go back and listen to it. So I am obsessed with product. The people that I admire the most are great products. It could be Jiro’s sushi. It could be the Spotify app. It could be, it doesn’t matter, shoes that I like. I just love when people take what they do very seriously and I like the craft of it. And I want to dedicate my life to making a product that makes somebody else’s life better. That is what drives me. I understand, and I have a bunch of friends that like the money or building the systems, if you want to go back to archetypes or just having a big empire. I don’t have any employees. You have three. I guess I have two technical subcontractors doing clips for me and thumbnails and stuff like that. But yeah, I don’t have any desire for a giant empire. I’m a little craftsman in my local shed over here. Tim Ferriss: So why do the new podcast, David Senra? David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Why do it? And we can use any number of different entry points here. So number one, why do it? But you don’t have to answer that as number one. I’m also curious where you see the podcast ecosystem. Is it early? Is it late? Is it oversaturated? Is it undersaturated, et cetera? And then how do you diversify an interview-based podcast? David Senra: Okay. So let’s take number one, the why do it. I was resistant on doing it for years because I like to do one thing and I don’t like to not focus. A huge thing, that if you could summarize nine years, 400 biographies into one word of what I’ve learned, is focus. These people, whether they’re psychos, nice people, different industries, they’re remarkably focused. They’re a different species than the current level of lack of attention spans that we have now that I think are getting worse. So focus is especially important. If you look at how I spend my time though, we just talked about the importance of building a business that’s natural to you. Half my waking time, I would like to be completely alone, not in even the house with somebody else. Alone in my reading, thinking. I like solitude a lot to a scary degree. So that makes sense. Founders, reading books all day, that’s what you do. That makes perfect sense. When I’m not doing that though, if you look at what else I’m doing, essentially do this data dump where I’m in silence half the day and then I go out every night that I’m not with my family. I usually have dinner with another founder, usually that I met through the podcast, and we talk for two, three — some people are like, “Oh, really impressed.” People will send me, “I would love to talk to you.” And they send me a calendar for 30 minutes. I go, “I don’t do 30. We’re not even going to start. We haven’t even started. If that’s what you think this is, I don’t care that you’re a billionaire, we’re just never going to meet, ever.” And it’s always super long from the very first time. I can mention all these people, we talked for a long time. So I’m doing this, anyways. And for years, people like Patrick were like, “You stupid idiot. You should be recording these. This is crazy.” And so there’s two things, to answer your question, that happened. One is, the first time me and Patrick grabbed dinner in New York with Daniel Ek, okay? We talked for four hours. And we get in the car because we’re leaving the city and going back to Patrick’s house because I’m going to spend the night there before I go back home. And the first thing Patrick says, and again, this is why it’s important. The piece of advice that Charlie Munger gave us when we were at his house, he’s like, “Your job at your age is to build a seamless web of deserved trust with other people who are like you.” He’s like, “Everybody knows that me and Buffett — I met Buffett when I was 35. He was 28. What they didn’t understand, there’s a bunch of other guys around our age that we built the same level of trust with and we did life with and did deals with forever. Most of them were dead by the time I met Charlie. And so relationships are very important.” And Munger has that line, “Trust is one of the greatest economic factors in the world,” which I’ve never heard anybody else say that. That’s a truly unique idea. Tim Ferriss: I agree with that. David Senra: And so there’s a level of trust that I am very standoffish. People call me a turtle, I get my shell. And so once you’ve penetrated that, I have a level of trust that you want what’s right for me. There’s no weird competitive vibes here, we’re not secret adversaries. I want to see you win. And then we get in the car and he’s just like, “Goddammit, you need to record these.” And he’s like, “I’ve known Daniel for four years. You got more out of him in four hours than I did in four years.” He’s like, “I spoke two percent of the time. You spoke 49 percent. He spoke the other 49 percent.” And he’s just like, “There’s nobody that could speak to the soul of the founder in the world that you can.” And it’s because he says something and it’s not what he’s saying. It’s what Henry Ford did here and Henry Kaiser did there and Jim Casey did over here, and that’s how my brain naturally works. So I was like, “Okay, that was interesting.” And then part of the conversation was Daniel saying to take — I wasn’t doing video. I have 375 episodes because I’m not doing it for fame. I’m introverted. And Daniel’s just saying in a very nice way, “What are you doing? Stop riding the fence. This is the game that you chose.” And I have the data. Video obviously is important in podcasts. You’re lying to yourself again. The importance of somebody telling the truth. I want people around me to check me. I don’t want sycophants. And I’ll tell you the second person that influenced me that calls me and checks me all the time. And so that got in my mind for a while and I was like, “Okay, that’s interesting.” And I get sad when I don’t podcast. I would like to podcast every day and I can’t because I have to read an entire book before I sit down to make an episode. I cannot make more than 52 episodes a year. I just can’t. I can’t read — people are like, “You must read fast.” No, I read slow, 25 pages an hour at most. And I have to do all the other shit I just told you I had to do, highlighting. You know how long this takes? Tim Ferriss: Taking photographs, putting it into Readwise. David Senra: Yeah. And so then something else that’s important to me is I’m not a political person at all. I don’t even read the news. I will find out the important stuff. If there’s a pandemic, I’ll hear about it. If there’s a war, I’ll hear about it. Other stuff, no idea what’s going on. I have no idea what’s going on. I’m purposely aloof. But one thing that I am passionate about is that entrepreneurship is good for the world as long as you’re spending your time building. You mentioned Losing Your Virginity by Richard Branson. He has the best description I’ve ever heard of a business. “All a business is, is an idea that makes somebody else’s life better.” And therefore, there’s always opportunity because there’s infinite ways to make other people’s lives better. And so that’s what I’m trying to do. And so another person who I’ve become close with is Jared Kushner. We live in Miami together. And we went and met for dinner, and Jared’s a really smart and buttoned-up guy. And again, I don’t pay attention to politics. So the way I met him is actually he reached out to Rick and is like, “I’m a huge Founders fan. Can you contact, see if David would speak at my company offsite?” A lot of companies ask me to speak at their company offsite. And I didn’t know anything about Jared. All I know is that people on the internet like to argue about them because of the Trump stuff, but I judge people on how they are with me. This ever happened to you where you were like, “That person’s great,” and you deal with them, like, “Oh, that guy’s terrible,” or vice versa? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve had both. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. So I’m going to go into this, I’m not going to do the research. I have no idea about all this stuff. I’m just going to see how this is going to go. And then we hit it off right away, and he tried to pay me. I was like, “No, no, no. It’s in Miami. I can drive over there. I can talk about this shit all the time. I like talking about this.” And then we just built a relationship and a friendship from that. We have similar interests. And so we meet for dinner one day. Basically, he went and spoke at this conference in Miami, and he thought he was going to go talk about his new fund, and he thought he was friends with the guy, and the guy’s selling tickets and making money off his name being there. And it’s not like you’re paying speakers. And the guy, essentially, ambushed him and starts asking questions like, “How can you do business with Saudi Arabia? They chopped up Khashoggi,” and all this other stuff. And then before the talk was even done, his social media team was clipping it and sending it out in press releases and stuff. Tim Ferriss: What a mess. David Senra: So I show up at this dinner, and Jared’s always buttoned up and always got his shit together and he’s just like, “What the hell is going on here?” And by the time the dinner ends, it’s everywhere. And again, I’m like, “This is weird that the business and tech press in America, they hate business and tech. They cover things.” I’m an enthusiast. I’m not a journalist, I’m not a critic. I read books all the time where I hate the person or something. You’ll never see me do a podcast about it. I want to talk about stuff I like, not things I hate. It’s a weird thing to go through. Imagine waking up every day, and your job is to cover people that you secretly wish you were. There’s just weird stuff around this. So we had this idea at dinner. I was like, “There should be a place where…” I am not talking about sycophant. I’m saying Todd Graves, people make fun of him because he says that God made him good at chicken fingers and that he’s living a chicken finger dream he thinks is a mission. But I’ll tell you what, he believes it. He’s been offered billions. He owns over 90 percent of the company. He will never sell that company. He’s not doing it for money. He’s doing it because he wants to make money and he does a lot of great things in the community. And I think people should know this guy exists and his ideas should be spread. That’s a good for the world. So those two things happened, and I’m like, “Oh, this is interesting.” I have this weird base of knowledge. So the way Jared describes it is, he’s like, “Talking to you is like talking to 50 of history’s greatest entrepreneurs at the same time.” Because we’ll talk about something and same thing you see I do. And then Daniel’s way of saying that, he’s like, “You’re like an LLM trained on history’s greatest entrepreneurs with the temperature turned up because you’re crazy. So it makes it entertaining.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I think that’s no small contributor to why you have a die-hard fan base. It’s the pulpit preacher fervor that you bring to it. David Senra: But I didn’t understand that until I thought about my childhood. When people say they go to church, that’s not the kind of churches I went to. This really gets me sad and where I was almost crying earlier. My mom deserved a better life. She didn’t deserve to grow up with the monster of her father and frankly, the bitch that her mom was. The one thing that I remember about my mom’s mom that she said to me was that I was a faggot. That is literally the only memory I have is her — she was mentally ill. You’d go to her house, you know National Enquirer and all those things? There’s National Enquirer, there’s The Sun, and all this other stuff that you get when you go to the grocery store. First of all, she was a hoarder, so you’d go in the bathroom and there’s stacks all the way up to the — she wouldn’t throw them out. But she read them like we read The Wall Street Journal. You assume the stock is what they said the stock price is. She’d read it like, “This is true. Bigfoot is true.” I was a kid. This is the memory. I was the age when President Clinton was in the White House and she was convinced that Clinton was gay and his wife was lesbian. And so she saw conspiracy everywhere, and she would direct that at her grandchildren, which is monstrous. And so my mom deserved better. And then the problem was, my mom didn’t have an education and she was a very naive person. And so she turned to the church, but the church she turned to was — do you know who Benny Hinn is? Tim Ferriss: I do know the name. Yeah. David Senra: Okay. So you come up there and he blows on you and you don’t have leprosy anymore, or he hit you in the face, does this thing, and you can walk now. And all this stuff was acting. They caught these people over and over again. And I remember my mom didn’t have a bunch of money and her putting a couple crumpled-up dollars and giving it to them because she thought this is what she’s going to get in her life. It’s sickening to me now that that happened to her and that she fell prey to that and that these people did this and they have private jets and they have all this crazy — I’m sure there’s some people that do that and they believe it. That’s a different thing if they really believe it. I know that guy didn’t believe. Come on, you didn’t believe that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it was a racket. David Senra: But then I didn’t understand that, oh, my God, that influenced the way I make my podcast because it is like — preacher. I feel I shouldn’t be sitting at a desk. I should be sitting at a pulpit. Somebody bought the domain churchforfounders.com, and it points to my podcast. Tim Ferriss: That’s amazing. David Senra: So that’s why I’m doing it. And then the other thing was I just like podcasting and I can have a conversation every day. So we’re going to start out every other week, and then move up to every week, and then I want to be having multiple conversations a week. That’s what I want to do because I’m doing it anyways. Let’s just put a microphone there. And it’s not an interview. Yeah, there’s some questions I have for them, but it’s like a conversation. The idea that I’m going to do a business show interview and compete with Patrick, I think he’s the best interviewer by far. He’s so concise and perfect and he’s just really good at it. And I like to talk. I want to talk 49 percent of the time. Tim Ferriss: How will you balance the two shows? Because it seems like Founders podcast takes a lot as it is. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: One of the benefits of that format is — now, this might put a cap on growth to some extent, but if you’re not playing the video game, it removes a lot of complexity. You don’t necessarily need to travel. You just read. You enjoy your solitude. You do some long-form audio, you can have notes in front of you. You can be picking your nose as you take a deep breath. There’s a lot of flexibility there. How are you going to balance the two without sacrificing Founders, snuffing out the magic X when you’re working on Y? David Senra: This goes back. That’s a great question and it’s something I was very concerned with, and that’s why I said no for so many years. And so then you think if you said yes, then how would you do it instead of just blankly saying no? And there’s a secret of dealing with me that everybody that knows me for a long time realizes, anybody that’s been around me for a long time, and essentially it’s like water on a rock. This is literally going to happen multiple times. So let’s say Patrick or Sam Hinkie would be like, “I have this idea.” And immediately, I’m like, “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard.” And I’ll be really aggressive and angry. It’s like, “Stupid idea, terrible idea.” Then they mention it two weeks later, and now it’s just, “Dumb idea.” Mention it again a few weeks later, silence. Then a few weeks later, I’m like, “Hey guys, I have a great idea.” Tim Ferriss: It’s their idea. David Senra: It’s their idea. Tim Ferriss: A slow-bake. David Senra: They know. They’re just like, “Okay.” It’s just water on a rock. I’ll get to them, it’s just going to take a while. And the problem is now I’ve said that, they know that, and then you have other people that have to deal with me. I’m very difficult to deal with, obviously. You are too. And I think that’s one thing we can bond over. And you’re not trying to be mean, it’s just part of our personalities. And so the answer to your question is Founders is a one person — so I read, I research, I record, I set my own mics, I do all the editing, I hand do the transcripts, I do everything. The only thing outsourced is that I think the clip guy I have is a little genius, a young kid living in Paris. His name’s Maxim, he’s incredible. And then I have somebody now because I have to play the YouTube game, which I hate, and I refuse to do the YouTube thing. I hate it. Tim Ferriss: I haven’t. David Senra: Exactly, I won’t. Tim Ferriss: I’ve cauterized myself in that. David Senra: I won’t do that kind of shit. I’d rather not get views. I have to see something and say I would click on that myself. I’m not doing things for numbers. I didn’t even know how many people were listening to Founders until the first six years. I never looked. And then I started doing these big sponsorship deals and they’re like, “Oh, I should look.” And they’re like, “Oh, this is great.” But I don’t like thinking about numbers. I don’t want it to influence anything that I do. And so the Founders basically take seven days. Usually, I’m late on the episode. Tim Ferriss: Something in common with Dan Carlin. David Senra: Yeah. No, I’m five days late. He’s five months late. God, man. Tim Ferriss: Love you, Dan. You know that. David Senra: Yeah. He’s literally the best podcaster to ever live. So what I realized is if I was going to do this, I would need a team. And I don’t like working with other people because I’m difficult. I can be mean. I just am. And I don’t want to be mean. I really don’t. You mentioned earlier not getting some of the bad personality traits from them. And I was worried. I’ve asked friends, “Do you think I’m sociopathic? Am I all this?” They’re like, “No. You have empathy. You have a hard outer shell, but you’re really soft in the middle.” Patrick will tell you that. Tim Ferriss: Turtle. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. When I was in Japan, we went to some — what’s the ones where you have 20-course meals? Tim Ferriss: Oh, omakase. David Senra: Yeah. And they try to — Tim Ferriss: Which literally means, basically, I’ll leave it to you. Omakase is like, “Leave it to you.” So you can use it that way too, “Makaseru.” David Senra: Well, why do they call it omakase and it’s multiple — what does it have to do with — Tim Ferriss: Omakase, is you don’t pick anything à la carte. You let the chef. Sit down and they just give you what they want to give you. David Senra: Yes. And then they come in there, they make sure — Tim Ferriss: So you’re leaving it up to them. David Senra: But then they come in after everything and they want to talk to you about it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that’s very un-Japanese. That’s probably for foreigners. David Senra: Okay. So they tried to give me — Tim Ferriss: They might be like, “This is this,” and then they stop. But this guy was giving you little mini TED Talks? David Senra: No, he tried to get me to eat essence of turtle. It was baby turtle. I was like, “I’m not eating turtle.” Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t sound great. I’m not excited about essence of turtle. David Senra: Hey, the face you just made should be the turtle face. Tim Ferriss: I feel like if David Senra doesn’t work as a podcast name, you could have Essence of Turtle. David Senra: So what I realized is I need a team. So what I could see is eventually going down. Right now I’m making a new Founders episode every 10 to 14 days, which is not good. And I’ve tried to do every week. The cadence probably should be every two weeks. Me and Rick were talking about this this morning in regards to you, the same way. What’s that old apocryphal saying? “I would’ve wrote you a short letter, but I didn’t have time so I wrote you a long one.” He says me and you share that thing where the reading’s not taking longer, the recording’s not taking longer. It’s the editing before I do anything, it’s this wieldy, 15,000-word thing. I’m trying to get down to 5,000 words. Takes so long to do. So to answer your question, could see a future — I’m never going to stop doing Founders, where I have to reduce. It can’t be 52 a year. Second and biggest thing is I took an idea from one of Rockefeller’s biographies. So one of the things that I do that I also think is important is you read all the famous biographies, but you’ve got to go through the bibliographies. Books are made out of books. Everybody has read Titan by Ron Chernow. In the bibliography of that, there’s the best Rockefeller biography I’ve ever read, and I have eight at the house I haven’t read yet. I collect obscure Rockefeller biographies that I’ll eventually get to. Tim Ferriss: What’s your favorite one? David Senra: It’s called John D: The Founding Father of the Rockefellers, by David Freeman Hawke. Tim Ferriss: Better writer than a titler. David Senra: Yes. 250 pages instead of 800, but all about what you really want to know. You don’t want to know about where his grandfather was born. You want to know how he built Standard Oil. And there’s this idea in there that I’ve used called secret allies. And so this is going to answer your other question about podcasting, where he’s at the beginning of the oil industry. It’s the very beginning and he’s there. Tim Ferriss: Rough and tumble time. David Senra: Yeah. No one knows shit about oil refining. So what does he do? He goes and builds a network of secret allies with other oil refiners and then eventually do something that’s even more nefarious, which they start something called the Oil Refiners Association of America or something. And then he gets himself elected president to that. And then what happens is, it’s like if we had a podcaster union and I’m president of the podcaster union, and then I go to you and like, “Tim, what’s your downloads this month? And how much are you charging for ads? And then who’s your next guest?” And he’s getting all this data. So then he sees, “That’s a joker. That guy’s already out of business. He doesn’t even know it yet.” Tim Ferriss: “Oh, we don’t have to worry about that guy.” David Senra: Yeah. “That guy’s a killer. I need to buy his company and make him a partner.” And so this idea of secret allies. So I’m obsessed with podcasting. And so what I would go do, I’d go around and I would talk to any podcaster who would talk to me. And we talk about everything, downloads, ads, who you’re selling to, how are you selling, who are you using for editing. Tim Ferriss: Maybe that’s the spider sense I got. David Senra: No. No, because I give. I give — Tim Ferriss: I know, I’m kidding. I’m kidding. David Senra: There’s people, literally, they’ll even tell you. There’s podcasters that literally, I took an idea from one podcast and gave it to another podcast because that’s the whole thing. I don’t collect it and hold it. We spread it around and they’ve made millions and millions of dollars from these ideas. Tim Ferriss: I have a friend named Kevin Kelly. Kevin Rose does that too. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Just gives away. Derek Sivers does it too. Gives away as many as possible. And if he can’t get rid of one that keeps him up at night, it’s like, “All right.” David Senra: If you’re talking about podcast data, who’s the mad scientist of podcast data? Chris Hutchins. Me and you’ve talked to him. We both talked to him. He has good shit because he tells you stuff and he tells me stuff that I didn’t know. And he’s this weird mad scientist, but he’s in this weird part of podcasting I don’t even think about. Tim Ferriss: All the Hacks. People, check him out. David Senra: Yeah. He’s been on your podcast twice. Tim Ferriss: Once because he wanted to have this long conversation with me about a bunch of stuff I was doing. And I was like, “If we’re going to do that, make it good with your questions and we’ll just record it. And then I can share it because I don’t want to answer all these questions over and over again.” It was about podcasting. David Senra: It’s a great idea. And so basically, I took that idea. So anyways, I was able to build a lot of relationships with a lot of great podcasters who are friends who share information. But then you also see, “Oh, wait, there’s a lot of disparity between podcast teams and stuff.” And so Rob Mohr and Andrew Huberman tried to recruit me years ago, because they have a podcast network called SciComm that they really don’t do much with because it’s really hard to launch another health podcast when they’re dominating that vertical. Is there another Huberman in that vertical that’s not discovered? Unlikely. And power laws were everything around us. And so I got this crazy DM and then a phone call with Rob, and he’s just like, “Dude, who are you?” And this is when I had, again, 5,000 listeners. And he’s like, “I’ve never come across anything like this.” And then we wound up talking. I think every single time we talked, it was over — this is on the phone, for over two hours every time and it’s all about podcasting. And then they’re like, “We’re looking for other Hubermans, and you’re this giant nerd that loves reading obscure shit and breaking it down in an entertaining manner just like Andrew does.” And he’s like, “Would you be interested in joining us on SciComm?” And I was like, “You are two weeks too late because it’s not announced yet. But I have a verbal agreement with this guy named Patrick and I’m joining Colossus.” But we still became friends and everything else. And so basically me and Rob, we’d spent a lot of time, I spend my summers in Malibu, so I see them all the time. And I’ve talked to Andrew and they’re just killers. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re very good at what they do. David Senra: They’re just operationally excellent. And they have a small but mighty team, and every single person in that team, they’re very focused. So their photographer’s one of the best photographers. Their editor’s one of the best editors. Their video people are some of the best video people. Their internet guy’s one of the best internet guys. It’s just everything. And so their whole point was — I was like, “Listen, Founders is never going anywhere. It’s staying on Colossus. It’s staying exactly what it is. But if I do something new, I’ll let you know.” And so when I went to them, it was just like, “Here’s the thing. I am going to pick the guests. I’m highly disagreeable. I will never take direction from anybody. I want to pick the guests and I want to have the conversations. And then everything else has to be A-plus team around me. And that means from visuals, to editing, to clips, to every single thing.” And they’re operationally excellent. I have not met a better — just spend time with them. Tim Ferriss: Very well-architected. David Senra: And then the way they built their business is genius.Tim Ferriss: So what does success look like for you two years from now? Three, five, pick your time frame. David Senra: Oh, success looks the same now and forever that I’m proud of what I made. That’s it. I don’t care what the numbers are. I love the climb. Tim Ferriss: Let’s say this show does really well. David Senra: Oh, it is going to. Tim Ferriss: So David Senra does really well. And not saying Rob would do this, but you know what we would really love to do is a third show, and it’s incredibly compelling, maybe it’s a slightly different angle or a totally different angle. Who knows? Who the hell knows? Interviewing spouses of all these famous people, which I think would actually be an amazing podcast. I’m sure someone’s doing it. But besides the quality of the product and being proud of the product, there is such a thing as too many different products. David Senra: Oh, sure. Tim Ferriss: There is such a thing as simply burning the candle at both ends. So you’re at a battery capacity that compromises the product, maybe long-term or your life. You’ve got more considerations than just business. So how do you think about those other factors when you telescope out a few years? David Senra: I’m not a long-term planner. So I would say I’m basically non-analytical at all. I go straight off intuition. Steve Jobs says this great line where he thinks intuition is more important than intelligence, and that intuition played a larger role in his success than anything else. Intuition and perseverance. And so I used to think I was more analytical and I have a five-year plan, a 10-year plan. All a great life is, is a string of great days. And so the furthest I plan out is 24 hours. I actually have this weird — I don’t even know if I should say this publicly. I don’t think humans actually understand time at all. And when you say a decade, yeah, we know a decade’s 10 years. But do we actually understand what that means? I think we maybe understand a week, a month. We definitely understand a day because that’s how we live. We live 24 hours at a time. And so all I try to do is like, “Can I design a day that I really enjoyed?” And not hedonistic. I’m not laying around doing nothing. I have to work. I feel guilt and shame when I’m not being productive. And that’s probably a bad thing. There’s all reasons that you could psychoanalyze why that is the case, but I just know how I am. I like to work. I like to get up and get after it. I don’t like taking vacations. The stuff I get invited to is crazy. I like to work. I like podcasting. I’m obsessed with it. Everybody’s like, “We talked about this multiple times. Why don’t you do something else?” I like doing this. I will keep doing this. So to answer your question, I just try to make a great day. And the way I make a great day is I want to wake up, I want to take care of my health. I want to read. I want to make a product I’m really proud of and I want to spend time with people that I love and admire. And I’m going to do that the next day and the next day and the next day. And I think if I have a great day today and a great day tomorrow and a shitty day a month from now and then a better day the next day and I get through my life and it’s just a string of great days, that will be a great life. And so two years from now, I don’t know because if you asked me two years ago, I said, “There’s no way I’m going to do another podcast.” But I would say my answer is that simple. The maxim I like about this is I love the climb. I don’t care where the summit is. I just like the activity for the sake of itself, and so therefore, I’m going to do it. And I hope it’s well-received. But I couldn’t have predicted that Founders was going to turn out the way it was. So I don’t know. I’m just going to do great work that I’m completely fascinated by and it gives me energy. And on the other side of that, this is what Stephen King said, “I’m not just the writer. I’m the first reader.” I listen to every single episode of Founders before anybody else and I just threw out one. The book is great, Bill Walsh’s The Score Takes Care of Itself. I read it for the first time five, six years ago. I read it again. Love the book. I made a podcast on it. It’s an hour and 15 minutes long. I finished editing it. I listened to it, not good enough, threw it away. That’s it. Can I make something that I’m proud of? Tim Ferriss: So I believe all of that and I want to push on a little bit. David Senra: Go for it, please. Tim Ferriss: Because the great days make great lives, I agree with. But now your circle of interaction is expanding with a show that involves other people with very busy schedules. So to what extent are you going to be traveling to all these people versus having people travel to you? That type of decision has longer-term implications, right? So I’m curious how you think about that. David Senra: So the way I think about this is this goes to the other side of me that’s probably not healthy, that I have a ruthless competitive drive that I think would terrify most people. I have a very negative inner monologue that I never think I’m doing enough. I have multiple people depending on me financially, way above and beyond just your wife and kids, other people that I have to make sure that I can take care of, so I have a lot of pressure on me. I want the pressure. So, to answer your question, it’s like I’ll do whatever it takes to win. And so, if that means I’ve got to get on a plane, or I get a little less sleep, then that’s what’s going to happen. But I also think you’re also smart, and you can think about these things, like okay, you want to talk to extreme winners in business, is essentially — not really starter/founders, I want people that have decades of experience. Every single person, if you look at the people that we’ve been recording with so long, I’m just more interested in talking to people that have done things for a long time, that are smarter and more productive and better than I am. And so, setting up here, where we are in New York, is probably a good idea because everybody comes through New York. Now, we’ve recorded several in L.A., here’s also a thing to consider, most of the people I’m talking to have planes. Rick pulls me aside and says this all the time, multiple people have told me this, you don’t understand the impact that you’re having on people, because I don’t think about it. I’m by myself all the time, I don’t look at numbers. And so, people have literally gotten their jets and flown across the country because I was like, “Hey, can you do it on this day in L.A.? Are the teams there? It’s more convenient.” And they do it because they think I’ve done something for them, but I’m just like, “No, no, no, I haven’t done anything for you, I just thank you for listening. The fact that you listen to my podcast means I get to do this for a living.” This is more Munger has really heavily basically influenced my thinking, it’s just like the reciprocation tendency in humans is so pronounced and it’s evolved. Yes, and it’s never going away, and what I didn’t understand and I still don’t understand, because I don’t like talking about, I don’t like thinking about this shit. I think about, like, as if I’m talking to one person is the fact that so many people have gotten value. Every single person’s recorded an episode with us for the new show so far has listened to a ton of shows of mine. And their point was it’s important work, and it’s more — Todd Graves has actually told me this two weeks ago. He’s like, “It’s important work and it’s more important the bigger your company gets.” Because if I can hear a single idea, or either avoid a mistake or get a good idea — Tim Ferriss: That’s true. David Senra: — and it makes a one percent difference on my business, that’s — I can’t do math, I can’t do public math. A billion dollars, whatever the number is, $2 billion. It’s a huge — no, that’d be 10 percent. So, if it makes a 10 percent difference in his business, it’s a huge swing. And so, so far, and again, you have a private jet, where do you actually live? Wherever you have to — Tim Ferriss: Also, your carrying costs for that jet are pretty high. David Senra: Yeah, so I — Tim Ferriss: So, there’s a little bit of pressure just to utilize the damn thing. David Senra: You want to hear something funny? I’ll go back to why I think New York and L.A. is going to be where I’m recording most of these. And we’re willing to travel, we will if we have to. If Dyson says, “Come do it,” I’m coming to England, I don’t give a shit. So, Sam Zell told me, he’s like, “I told you that lunch I had with him changed my life?” He’s like, “Don’t make the same mistake,” he’s like, “I know all the rich guys,” and he says, “first of all, they’re all guys…” That’s what he told me. He goes, “Two, you’d be surprised how many of them are miserable. And they do stuff they don’t like for more money that they can’t spend, and then they make the same mistake, where they buy slight…” This is his word, it’s not mine. He goes, “they buy slightly nicer versions of the same shit.” He goes, “The difference between a $10 million house and a 30 million house is negligible.” And he’s like, “I own my place in Chicago, and my compound in Malibu,” that’s the word he used, compound. And he goes, “I rent everything else.” He goes, “The things that you own start to own you.” And he said every year, after, I think, Thanksgiving and in between Christmas, he’d take his entire family, extended family, to this little village in France. And he said, he’s always a shit talker. And he said funny things, he goes, “I could buy the whole village.” He goes, “I don’t, I rent it, and then I don’t think about it until I go back. It’s somebody else’s problem.” And he goes, “There’s only one true luxury in life,” he goes, “it’s a private jet, try to get to private jet money.” And he is like, “I use my jet three hours a day.” On average, he uses jet three hours a day. He was in South Florida, because he’s like, “I woke up in Chicago this morning, I got on my jet, I went across the street, gave a talk to a bunch of investors and entrepreneurs,” because that’s what he wanted to spend his last days doing. He knew he was dying, he didn’t tell me though, I didn’t know that. We were scheduled to have another dinner, and it got canceled and they said he was sick, I was like, oh, he got COVID. He died three weeks later, so I never got to see him again. But the way he was spending his last days, at his own expense, traveling all over the world on his beautiful giant plane, spending a lot of money, is passing on the knowledge that he learned through 61 years to other investors and younger and entrepreneurs. And so he goes, “I did that this morning, came over here, had lunch, I’m going to get in my car, and go back to Chicago.” He used it three hours a day. So, so far people have been willing to fly to come to us, I’ll come to some people if they’re super busy schedules, and then I think just setting up in a place where they all will come through would make a lot of sense. Tim Ferriss: Anyone on your wish list that you haven’t been able to track down? David Senra: No, surprisingly, again, I don’t like thinking about this, where I don’t understand that today, right now, if I do an episode on somebody living, it’s going to get to them. They might not be a listener, but — this just happened with Jimmy Iovine. So I have these weird, people are always surprised, they think, who’s on your list? Obviously I respect Bezos, respect Elon, all of them, but I would say like Todd Graves, they’re like, “What the hell’s wrong with you? And James Dyson. The vacuum cleaner guy?” I’m weirdly obsessed with these people. And so, one of the people I’m obsessed with is Jimmy Iovine. And Jimmy Iovine, Defiant Ones. Tim Ferriss: Such a good series. David Senra: I watch it — Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God, it is so well done. If anyone hasn’t seen Defiant Ones, go watch it. It’s head spinningly good. David Senra: With the description of the four-part documentaries, oh, it’s a relationship between Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. Yeah, it’s really a documentary about entrepreneurship, it’s about chasing a path — chasing a path, there’s no path in front of you. There was no path for Dre to get out of Compton, there’s no path from Jimmy to get, for the son of a longshoreman in Brooklyn, to go what happened to him. He’s fascinating. And then this is my point about what do you actually value in life? Jimmy’s a billionaire. I don’t know, he’s got a billion, $2 billion, whatever the case is, I’d be more interested in that than if he had $100 billion. If you asked me whose life would you want, Buffett or Munger, Buffett was 100 times richer, I’m taking Munger every day. What I like about Jimmy is that he lived an interesting life. The episode, you see it on Defiant Ones, crazy stories in there, but Rick Rubin, who, you mentioned, if podcasting is saturated, which we can get to, Rick Rubin’s really good because he’s a world-class listener. He took a skillset, what was his skill for the work that he did? Why are these musicians hiring him? To listen, to hear something they don’t hear, and to suggest something they might not hear, might not understand. And the episode he did with Jimmy Iovine I think came out in 2023, I think it was the single best podcast I listened to all year. And it’s just Jimmy Iovine telling insane story after insane story about the music business, because the music business is a wild business. And what I like about my business is that it’s a unique experience generator. It creates opportunities and experiences you can’t buy, and the amount of people I get to meet and talk to — my memoirs are going to be wild because of the weird dinners I’ve been to, and the planes I’ve been on, and the boats I’ve been on, and it started because I was a giant nerd, with a giant head, sitting in a room by himself for five years, just mainlining biography after biography after biography. Jimmy’s really interesting to me, and then what happened is, I don’t even — part of this, I can’t tell you how I got connected, he agreed to do the show, and one of the previous guests is the one that connected me, which again, I just don’t feel I deserve how nice these people have been to me and what they’re willing to do, and I don’t even like asking them for this. But it got to Jimmy — Tim Ferriss: Is that true? David Senra: No, I don’t like — the worst possible — Tim Ferriss: You put a lot of work into your podcast. David Senra: It doesn’t matter though, the worst possible thing — Buffett has — Tim Ferriss: Do you feel like you don’t deserve it? I feel like that’s an important question. David Senra: Buffett has a — I’ll answer that question in a minute. Buffett has the line’s, it’s like, “The people that win are the ones that their eyes are on the field, not the scoreboard.” I don’t — I was going for a walk last night, and you know this happens to you all time, I’m way earlier, you’re like an OG, man, you’ve been famous way — I still, when people stop me on the street, which happens, I’m like, “How do you know what I look like?” Tim Ferriss: No, that’s going to happen more and more. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. So, I’ve read all your blog posts about this too. I was on the phone with Morgan Housel this morning, who’s a big fan of yours. Tim Ferriss: Great guy. David Senra: Obviously you guys are friends. And we were talking about that, security around this, and all this other stuff, and then we were talking about you. Morgan’s just a peach of a human, he’s the opposite of me. Tim Ferriss: Psychology of Money, great book. David Senra: It won’t stop selling, won’t stop selling. Tim Ferriss: I know. Yeah. Got lightning in a bottle on that one. Yeah. Earned it. Earned it too. David Senra: Oh, 100 percent. And the nicest guy. If you think you want to find my directional opposite, and we’ll go back to the question you think is important, Morgan genuinely believes that his ceiling that he should have — he should be an insurance salesman somewhere in the Midwest, making 100,000 a year. And the fact that this guy got really, really wealthy — Tim Ferriss: Astronomical numbers. David Senra: Yes. Really, really wealthy, and just wakes up every day, can’t believe his life. I wake up every day like, “Why am I not a billionaire?” It’s like, he’s happy in a way I will never be, and this is why I think Daniel Ek’s advice about chasing — Daniel does not believe, this is one of the first things I asked him on the show, was — he was the one that put this idea out there that life is not about happiness, it’s about impact. He is not chasing happiness, he’s chasing impact. And he’s the one that actually convinced Dara, the founder of Uber, tells the story, they were having drinks — Tim Ferriss: Dara is CEO. David Senra: CEO. Yeah, sorry. Good distinction. I met Travis too. Most intense person I’ve ever been in contact with. Tim Ferriss: He is one hell of a builder, man. David Senra: Oh, for sure. Tim Ferriss: And different batteries. David Senra: Most intense. And I’ve been around a lot of intense, he is — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. He’s — David Senra: Very fascinating. Tim Ferriss: — he has different gears than most people. David Senra: Oh, and the storytelling, and the — he’s a phenomenal storyteller, phenomenal communicator. So, anyways, when Dara was going back and forth about becoming CEO of Uber, he said originally was going to say no because he was pretty happy with his life, and Daniel, in a very direct way, was like, “When’s life about happiness? It’s about impact. It’s like one of the most important companies in the world, and you can have an impact on it. You can have an impact on the way cities are changed. You absolutely have to do this.” And I think that’s a really interesting idea. So, I am trying to have impact. So, to answer your question, do I think I deserve it? I obviously know that I put a lot of work into it, and I believe that the product is good, and I think I found what I’ve put on the planet to do, but I don’t like thinking about it. I don’t like thinking about its impact on other people. I like it because I like it. I make it, I’m like, I would listen to this podcast, I think it’s valuable. I think you start doing shit for the wrong reasons — I talked to a lot of the head people at Spotify, and they said the biggest mistake, one of the biggest mistakes they made is the great thing about podcasting is that people that come up like we did, through the garage. You just started — I listened to your first episode. I remember TimTim TalkTalk. Tim Ferriss: TimTim Talk. David Senra: Yeah, I remember. Tim Ferriss: From my kitchen table. David Senra: With a friend. And why did you do it? I think you had a couple glasses of wine, right? And with a friend, because you’re like, I don’t — Tim Ferriss: Figured it out pretty quickly after listening to episode one that the second episode was going to be sober. David Senra: Oh, man. Tim Ferriss: Josh Waitzkin, number two. David Senra: Yeah. But you come up with, you did it because you were curious, you only talked to people you really want to talk to, you had no production costs. And so, Spotify said they flipped it. They’re like, we took something that was low production costs done by enthusiasts and people in the garage. Huberman’s analogy of this is, it’s punk rock. Punk rock is great because it started with people that just wanted to play in the garage, and then they got good, and then they played for stadiums. And so, Spotify’s like, oh, what we did was we took a low production cost, made a high production cost because we had these big contracts, and then we hired celebrities, and no one listened, and the people that did listen, they stopped because the celebrities were just doing it for money, they didn’t do it because they love it. And I think that’s the key. It’s like, I truly love this, I did it for five and a half years when no one was listening. That tells you that I love it. But I think one of the worst things you could do is, I’m going to do it because status is the funny thing. Podcasting is dorky, it’s low status. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. David Senra: In 2016, you think that was fucking high status? Tim Ferriss: No. David Senra: No. It was like, “You dorky nerd with a podcast.” Tim Ferriss: And to be clear, I’m not asking if you’re seeking status, it was more if you feel that you’re unworthy of people flying to you and doing these things, those are two very different — David Senra: No, yeah, I meant I think you see this now, that podcasting is obviously very influential and can be — there’s so many people jumping into it that clearly don’t love it. They like it because the CPMs are high or whatever, or they want to be famous. I had no video for eight years, do you think I want to be famous? Do you think I want to be recognized? No, I obviously don’t. I had to fucking had the most powerful person in podcasting berate me at dinner, in a nice way, saying, you idiot, you have to do video. That’s the only reason I do video because Daniel told me to. And how smart am I if I don’t listen to him? Then I’m an idiot. I have to do it. I don’t like doing it. So, I don’t know, man. I don’t know. I think at some point the platform gets big enough, like, “I flew here for this. Why? Because you have a massive platform, and you’re willing to extend it to me, and I’d travel wherever. You say. Iceland? I’m coming to Iceland, brother. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, I knew you like Argentina, let’s go down there. We’ll do an Argentina. So, yeah, I think eventually, when they see it’s big enough, that people would come to you, also try to make it easier, and I’m not doing it in Columbia, Missouri, I’m doing it in New York or L.A., you’re going to be there anyways.” Tim Ferriss: And also with the particular cohort that you’re interviewing with jets, if they’re like, “Sure, I’ll fly to New York,” and then they can also set up five other meetings with friends or business associates, or fill in the blank. David Senra: Make it easy. But I think really, man, I do this — I don’t, this is the turtle in me. I don’t like asking. Tim Ferriss: This is the turtle. David Senra: You can ask all the people that — we have a bunch of mutual close friends, I don’t like asking for help. And I think one of the weird ways that I think I built true friendships with some of these people is because all day long it’s, give me, give me, give me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I have never asked Rick for anything. I think one time to crash at his house, that’s it. All I want is to be homies, to be friends. I don’t want anything from this. And I think I didn’t understand because I didn’t come from this background, that when you’re high profile, and you’re building these empires, these are all empire builders. All day long they’re just surrounded by people that want something from them. And I’m just like, here, I have this podcast that might be valuable for you, you want it? I don’t want anything from you. And when they tell me, ask me for stuff, I still don’t like doing it. I don’t like doing it. It really hurt me to, would you be on my show? But I was like, all right, well, if I’m going to ask for something, I’ll do this. And not a single person I’ve asked has said no. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you love what you do, that is essential to producing the quality that you produce. It’s essential for the endurance to sort of outperform and outlast, because podcasting as a whole is just an elephant graveyard of three to 10 episode shows. So, if you choose something you really like, that you would make because you intrinsically enjoy it, if it’s an outgrowth of reading the biographies, taking the notes, and you’re like, well, this is really sort of in terms of additional work for me on top of something I might already be doing, actually not like the majority of the pie, and you have the fuel of that obsession you’re going to do well, even if it’s just for yourself, but certainly with the longevity you have the competitive advantage of durability. David Senra: That means a lot coming from you, and everything you’ve accomplished, and I think you actually hit to the essence of it, where it’s like, I can’t sleep after these things. I had to get up the next day when I was in Austin, I think I had a 7:00 a.m. flight, and I slept maybe three hours because just gem after gem after gem from Michael Dell. Or you’ll see this on the Todd Graves episode, dude, we were the same person. We’re the same person. And so, we’re spontaneously high-fiving — I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of, “This guy’s a dork.” Like, “Hey, give me another high-five, buddy.” We were just geeking out about minute details of just being obsessed with, his whole thing is do one thing and doing it better than anybody else. And I remember going from the airport, it was in Baton Rouge, and I immediately called Sam, who’s the closest thing I have to a mentor, and I was like, “I’m in trouble,” and he’s like, “Why?” I go, “I’m addicted to doing these things already, I can’t stop.” This was crazy. Tim Ferriss: It’s a good sign. David Senra: Crazy. Tim Ferriss: That’s how I pick my projects, largely, it’s how I pick some of my startups too that I get involved with. If I have what I would call good insomnia, for at least a few nights in a given week, and then I try to quell it, it doesn’t matter how much Trazodone I take, or anything else, I just am so excited by something that my mind is worrying and I can’t go to sleep, I’m like, okay, there’s probably something there. Also because it seems to be such an energetic unlock, I’m like, even if that one thing doesn’t do very well, if I can create this nuclear power from that, it’s not compartmentalized, it can apply to other things. So, I get it. I get it. Now, I was listening to, I don’t know how I found it — actually, I was going on, I think it’s Tom Papa’s show. He’s a comedian, great interviewer, and I was going on his show, this is a while ago, and I was doing some homework on my own, listened to an interview he did where he interviewed Joe Rogan. And I’m paraphrasing here obviously, but Rogan effectively said, he’s like, “Yeah, I don’t really think much about discipline or willpower,” he said, “what I do have though is obsession. And when I find something that I’m obsessed with, when I deep dive, it’s like I don’t need to worry about discipline. I don’t need to worry about willpower.” So, it’s like finding that thing that you are obsessed by. David Senra: I think 100 percent right. Tim Ferriss: And so I think you’ve done that. You’ve done that. So, you’ve found your lane. A lot of people don’t find it, right? They don’t find that thing. It’s like you wonder if Kobe Bryant were born somewhere and didn’t have the chance to pick up basketball, would it have been something else? Maybe if you were Michael Jordan, okay, it’s baseball or this or that, but it’s like, you found your thing, that’s kind of amazing. David Senra: No, I appreciate it. And the way I think about it’s, it took me 32 years to find my path, and five and a half years of struggle before I could even pay my bills. It was a long time. Kobe found it — imagine finding it at 12 like he did, and knowing. I read the 600-page biography on him by Roland Lazenby. And the middle school guidance counselor is like, he wrote down, “What are you going to do?” He’s like, “I’m going to play in the NBA.” He’s like, “You need to pick something else, that’s a one in a million shot.” He goes, “I’m going to be that one in a million.” To be that so sure at 12 years old, and this is what goes back to the lack of introspection. I had a lot of angst, and what is the meaning of life, or what am I doing here? And then once you find your thing, there’s like a, definitely not resting on laurels, but there is almost a relief, like — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: Because it’s not just finding something you love to do, it’s like, what is that — you’re like a Japanese encyclopedia. Ikigai, what is the — Tim Ferriss: Ikigai, yeah. David Senra: Yeah, it’s like the intersection of what you love to do, what you’re good at, and what’s good for the world. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. Ikigai gets used in a bunch of different ways. Japan’s always good for these pithy, conceptual words. David Senra: I think, I’m just going to be blasphemous for you, but I think travel is generally overrated, after you do it — Tim Ferriss: I am not jumping in — David Senra: — after you do it for a while. Because the problem is we keep going to all the nice places, and all the nice places are all the same to each other. The one thing that Japan blew my mind and why it’s the top of my list now of everywhere I’ve been, and where I’d want to go again is because it’s one of the few truly distinct cultures in the world. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a wild one. They also, they’re kind of like a chameleon, because they pull so much from other cultures. So, when it was in isolation, it was certainly an alien environment, and then you look at everything they’ve incorporated, and in some cases, in the case of, say, The Toyota Way, right? David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You have, I guess it was, I want to say Deming? David Senra: Yep. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right. Who was basically, not ignored, but certainly not embraced in his country of birth, gets adopted by the Japanese, and you see them do this over and over and over again. So, yes, it’s a fascinating place, and I would agree with you that especially people who travel in the lap of, it doesn’t need to be luxury, it could just be comfort — like rich person travel is the most boring shit in the world. David Senra: Same stores, same — Tim Ferriss: It’s just like, okay, you’re going to the Four Seasons in 12 different places, getting on the Wi-Fi, doing whatever it is you would’ve been doing at home, and then going to the most expensive meals, it’s just not interesting. So, I think if anybody wants a great book on the art of long-term world travel, if that’s of interest, Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. David Senra: I read that because of you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: The amount of books in my library because of you. I did the same thing with you that I did with all these other people, it’s like, oh, Tim says to read it, I read it.Tim Ferriss: And a lot of these books, they’re underneath it all, at least in the case of Rolf Potts’ book, Vagabonding, they’re really philosophical operating systems, and it’s a hat you can try on. You don’t have to wear it forever, but it’s like, okay, if you only have one jacket to wear, which is six gear workaholic, neglecting family guy, just expand your wardrobe. You can always put that jacket back on, you just hang it up for a moment. And similarly, I like these books, and they certainly can be business books, whether it’s Branson, who is in some ways, he took risks, but he’s kind of the opposite, at least in a lot of capacities to a Dyson. He risk mitigates the hell out of his ventures, and caps the downside in so many creative ways. David Senra: Like his airline. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. So, the artistry of deal making for minimizing or capping downside is one of Branson’s superpowers. Even though the stuff on the magazine covers back in the day, it was like, the mad man, who’s doing X, Y, Z, and has the models, and he’s — David Senra: Phenomenal marketer. Tim Ferriss: — and he’s kite boarding with a naked model on his back. You remember that? David Senra: That’s literally the picture I have in my mind. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God. David Senra: That looks fun. Tim Ferriss: He is also, can be a wild man. But I digress. I was just going to say that these are hats that you can put on to test them out as philosophical operating systems, which is how I pick a lot of the books. Yeah. Books, books, books. I was very similar to you when I was a kid, and also all throughout, just living in books, living and living in books, and — David Senra: It’s very common though in these stories. Rockefeller, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Edwin Land, Winston Churchill — the way I say this is like they don’t just read, they devour entire shelves. There’s multiple examples of Thomas Edison, Thomas Edison read every single book in the Detroit library. Edwin Land read every single book on light in Harvard, then dropped out because he didn’t think he had anything else to learn, moves to New York City, I think one of the most beautiful buildings is the one we passed on the way here, the New York City Public Library, read every single book on light in there, and then is like, okay, I learned enough, now I can do my experiments. They just devour entire shelves. Tim Ferriss: Monster. David Senra, what have we not talked about? People will be able to find, of course, the show. Davidsenra.com. David Senra: Yep. Tim Ferriss: Is that the best website? David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And David Senra: David Senra on all social channels, Instagram, X — Tim Ferriss: All social channels. David Senra: Podcast app — Tim Ferriss: Founders podcast, of course, founderspodcast.com David Senra: I appreciate you, you’ve included me in your newsletter in the past — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. David Senra: — on your blog. I read all your shit. And I’m like — and I didn’t even know, it’s shocking to me when I’m like, oh, because it’s not like you told me. I was like, what the hell? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you put out. The obsession and attention to detail doesn’t surprise me at all, when you told me about going through your transcripts by hand, I’m like, yeah, that makes sense. And I really have my fingers crossed for you, I don’t think you need any luck, but that David Senra is as durable as Founders podcast. If anybody can do it, you can do it. David Senra: I appreciate it. It means a lot coming from you, man. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Congratulations. David Senra: You’ve had a huge influence on me. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks man. David Senra: It’s long overdue, like I said, I ran into the hallway and grabbed you. I was like, “It’s been too long — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very, very, very long overdue. So, everybody listening, check out David Senra, I’m excited to check it out. David Senra: Thank you, brother.Tim Ferriss: And also know the team at Huberman Lab, Andrew, Rob, those guys are all top tier, so what’s coming is going to be absolutely top-notch.

David Senra: Brad Jacobs is, I think, the only person in history to start eight separate billion dollar companies. A lot of people on the West Coast, they don’t really know who he is because he’s just been an East Coast guy his whole life, but he started his first company when he was like 23. He’s 68 years old. He’s by far the most energetic person I have ever been around and he wrote this book called How to Make a Few Billion Dollars. Tim Ferriss: What are some of his companies with? What industries and so on? David Senra: He’s like the roll-up king. He’d roll up logistics companies and trucking companies and now he’s got a massive one that he just took public that’s doing building supplies. Early in your career you might roll up a $5 million company or a $20 million company. His first acquisition I think was like $9 billion. He just gets progressively bigger and bigger and bigger. What I find interesting about him is usually when you study extreme winners, and he’s obviously an extreme winner, what motivates them is kind of dark like issues with their father, some kind of insecurity, never felt good enough. They grew up poor and they felt they were born in the wrong place. Brad does it out of love. He’s got no negativity. He’s just a very special human being and the fact that I get to text him and call him and go to his house is insane. He’s just an amazing human being.Tim Ferriss: There’s another legend who defeated roulette and then went on to beat the market, Ed Thorp, probably another exception where — David Senra: The exception. Tim Ferriss: The exception where he did not eviscerate his personal life in the quest for business mastery. David Senra: I don’t think anybody’s mastered life clearly as much as Ed Thorp did. Your two interviews that you did with him were incredible. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. That was such a moment of gratitude to have the chance to interview him, especially because he is so, so sharp at his age. I can’t recall his exact age right now. David Senra: It’s like 89 or something like that. Tim Ferriss: If you want a holistic figure to consider emulating, Ed Thorp would be on a very, very, very short list. David Senra: I can think of three out of 400. Tim Ferriss: Who are the three? David Senra: Ed Thorp is at the top. Sol Price who’s the one that invented essentially the warehouse model like Costco, Jim Sinegal was mentored by Sol Price when Jim Sinegal was 18. Jim Sinegal, founder of Costco, built one of the greatest companies in history and he has this great line in Sol Price’s autobiography. Sol Price’s son wrote his biography. People are like, when Sol died, like, “You must have learned a lot from Sol.” He goes, “No, I didn’t learn a lot. I learned everything. Everything that I know I learned from this guy.” Sol Price, same thing, good husband, good father, didn’t chase after more money at the expense of other areas of his life after he already had enough money. Ed Thorp turned down so much, hundreds of millions, if not billions. He could have collected. He was just like, “I already have more money than I can ever spend. Why would I do that?” Then, I would say Brunello Cucinelli. Tim Ferriss: How are those examples different? You should explain for folks. I mean, look, everything I’m wearing I got for free. You should explain to people. I did not know the last name you mentioned until a few years ago because I won’t doxx him, but my friend Tony is basically covered in Brunello. Who is this? David Senra: Brunello Cucinelli wrote this, I don’t even know the name. I read the book. It’s like it’s something about Solomeo. Essentially, he sells $5,000 sweaters. He sells sweaters that were more than my first car, but he grew up in very rural Italy. Then, everybody at the time, there was just essentially the hollowing out of his community. Everybody had moved to the cities. He is a very soulful dude.Brunello essentially works. He essentially bounds his life where it’s like you work 9:00 to 5:00. You are not allowed to send an email to the company after 5:00. You have to take a break for lunch and they have this great Italian food. Then, he spends his nights reading and then going on long walks and then sitting in the cafes in this little town that he essentially rebuilt and reinvested in. He likes having cappuccino and debating philosophy. He’s just like a real soulful dude. Now the one criticism people have is like that business model works when you have 70 percent margins and your sweaters are as much as a Honda Civic, but it was very intentional. I don’t care what people do. It’s very intentional.Tim Ferriss:Let me come back to this question of clean fuel versus let’s call it dirty fuel and there’s a lot in between. I don’t want to look at it in a totally binary way, but why do you think of the say 400 plus that you can only call to mind three or four, Ed Thorp, Sol Price, Brunello Cucinelli, Brad Jacobs? Why are there so few who seem driven in that particular, let’s just call it positive way, or that they can pursue business excellence without having a lot of collateral damage in their personal lives? What do you draw from that? Look, maybe these are just different animals and out of the box these four are just fundamentally different from the other 396 or so, but what is your take on that thin slice of the total? David Senra: I would add another one to the list. You’ve also interviewed him, Michael Dell. Recently, I’ve spent hours and hours with him. We had a five hour dinner and then I just recorded a two and a half hour conversation with him for the new show. He is in love. His is very positive. Now he has a big fear of failure, which almost I think me and you probably share this. I won’t speak for you. I want to ask you actually. I am way more afraid of failure than I love winning. Tim Ferriss: I mean that’s true for everyone I know who wins a lot. I don’t think I can think of a single exception in terms of someone who celebrates the wins as much as they punish themselves for the losses. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, I’m just saying that’s pattern matching. David Senra: Even now with all the success that you’ve had, is your inner monologue still negative? Tim Ferriss: I mean there’s a lot of negative. I’m working on that. I look at some of the, I don’t want to call them maxims, but you’ve quoted the, I think it was the founder of the Four Seasons, David Senra: Excellence is the capacity to take pain. Tim Ferriss: Right, and there may be some truth to that, but I feel like it’s very risky for me to take something like that and wear it as a marching order for life because I already tilt in that direction and not all pain is productive. I think for me when you are already tilted in that direction where you believe if there isn’t pain, if there isn’t some degree of suffering, then you’re not trying hard enough. It’s very easy to become a hammer looking for nails and that can have a lot of repercussions for your relationships also. David Senra: For sure. Tim Ferriss: If your self-talk is negative, at least in my experience, what I’ve seen in a lot of my friends and peers and founders, very often you end up having a similar type of dialogue with people around you. That can have huge repercussions. That doesn’t give anyone a neat, tidy silver bullet of an answer, but the negative self-talk, there’s a place for it. The nuance to me matters a lot. If it’s like, “You’re a piece of shit. You always do X. Why don’t you do Y,” and that has a good outcome, I would still want to refine the process. David Senra: I read this biography of Jensen Huang, which is fascinating, because it’s right after one of the best quarters in NVIDIA history. He starts this meeting and he says, “I woke up this morning, looked in the mirror, and said, ‘Why do you suck so much?’” Tim Ferriss: He’s hardcore. David Senra: He’s very hardcore. Tim Ferriss: He’s hardcore. He’s hardcore. I guess what I’d also like to ask you is about not necessarily the people you study, and hopefully you take this as a compliment. It’s intended like a highest compliment. When people ask me about you they’re like, “So what’s the story? Why do people like this stuff?” I’m like, “Well, I can only really speculate,” but I feel like you are, in a way, what Dan Carlin did with Hardcore History, you do for business. Hardcore History is my favorite podcast of all. David Senra: I think Dan Carlin’s the greatest podcaster that ever lived. The reason I do a solo history show is because of Dan Carlin. I’ve given away his back catalog. I wish he would change his business model. Tim Ferriss: It is a bit janky, but if you want to just listen to the greats, I mean the “Wrath of the Khans” — David Senra: “Blueprint for Armageddon”, “Wrath of the Khans”, I think is the best podcast series ever created, in my opinion. “Blueprint for Armageddon”, just everything, I’ve listened to them. I’ve listened. He only has like 55 episodes. He was doing it for 15 years. I fall asleep at night. Right now last night I fell asleep listening to his new one. It’s not even new. It’s like six months old because he never released any episodes, “Mania for Subjugation Part Two”, about the relationship between Alexander the Great and King Philip. Tim Ferriss: Amazing. David Senra: He just puts me to sleep. He is the greatest. Tim Ferriss: The reason that I mentioned that is I feel like I’ve learned so much from Dan Carlin. I’ve learned so much from your episodes. I’m curious though, as I know another person, you’re a fan of Derek Sivers who I’ve known I think since 2007, amazing entrepreneur. People can look him up. I’ll give the one-liner, which is sort of this philosopher king programmer entrepreneur who started companies, gave the vast majority to a charitable trust to fund musical education. At one point, he was the ringleader in a traveling circus, played guitar and sang at a pig state fair, and has just crafted the most unusual and Derek life for himself and given his family permission to do the same for themselves. Really a true, original thinker who also shows it in his actions and this is where I’m going. Derek has this line. I may be paraphrasing it slightly, but the gist is “If more information were the answer, we’d all be billionaires with six pack abs.” What do you see or surmise about people who make the leap from listening to your podcast about all of these icons and people who have not just once you’re lucky, twice you’re good, but in some cases they built $8 billion companies? In that case, I might come back to the acquisition kind of roll-up archetype. The people who make the leap from ingesting information to actually implementing and those who don’t, what’s the missing piece in the middle? David Senra: The way I think about it, the maxim I’ve made for myself on this is learning is not memorizing information. Learning is changing your behavior. If you didn’t change your behavior, this is just all mental gymnastics for you. You’re just wasting your time. What I’m trying to do, I didn’t even understand what I was doing. I had to have, as happens in many cases, somebody outside of you seeing what you’re doing actually gives you what this whole thing is about. I have a good friend of mine. His name’s Jeremy Gafan and he’s really quick-witted and he has a way to condense ideas really well. We’re just walking around taking a walk in Miami Beach one day and he’s like, “Oh, yeah, it’s pretty obvious what this whole thing is.” I didn’t even think he was thinking about it. I was like, “What do you mean?” He’s just like, “Oh, you never had any positive influences. You didn’t have any mentors. If you take somebody like you who’s like psychopathically driven and really has an obsessive personality, that’s what this whole thing is. You’re just reading book after book after book to try to find the path, to try to find the answer, to try to find the way out.” I felt like naked when he said this. I’m like, “I think he’s right. I think he’s right.” For me, I’m definitely not just reading. I’ve been taking all these ideas. The unfair advantage I have is I have one-sided conversations with history’s greatest entrepreneurs. Every week I sit down and read another biography. Then, because I like to talk, this is good because I have to shut up. I can only listen because this is what I think it is. That’s what I think reading a biography is. It’s like one-sided conversation. Then, I take that and I would be doing this even if I didn’t record it, but then sitting down once a week and condensing my thoughts and reacting to it turns it to an act of service. Then, I take the ideas. I’m like, “Oh, that’s a good idea.” I’ll take that and apply it to my business, which is the podcast. It keeps getting better and better. I’m just like, “Oh, these ideas work so I’ll keep doing this.” Then, now what has happened is the people that are trying to be great have studied great people that came before them throughout human history. Caesar was studying Alexander and Steve Jobs was studying Edwin Land and Edwin Land was studying Alexander Graham Bell. If you’re interested in American entrepreneurship, it all kind of goes back to Benjamin Franklin. Everybody looks backwards like, “That guy or that woman was great. How did they do that?” That is an enduring part of human nature that will never change. It’s going to happen while we’re alive. It’s going to happen 1,000 years from now. What I didn’t understand what I was doing is that you put it out into the world just like your work. It’s like a tuning fork, right? It’s like then the people that are really great also do this and they have a deep love of history. If you look at the people that I’ve been talking to from the new show that’s not even released yet, they came because they’re fans. They’re in the audience and it’s just like the para social relationship people have with podcasts. I’m close to the people at Spotify. I’ve been to Stockholm twice in the last six months and I was talking to the head of business at Spotify. His name’s Alex and we were talking for two and a half hours like pretty animated. I was like, “I’m not building a media company. I’m building relationships at scale.” He’s like, “What? Say that again?” I go, “What a podcast is is building relationships to scale.” This is the first time we’ve ever met. Now we should talk about how I found you, but literally I found you on MySpace. I’m going to tell you that. Tim Ferriss: My God. David Senra: The reason, and we’ll go to the influence that you played on having Founders, but I know who you are. We could sit down and talk for eight hours because I know you. There’s no possible way I can consume all of your books and, I don’t know, 600 hours of your podcast and not know Tim. You can’t act for that long. What I didn’t understand is like this other path of me trying to find good information, valuable information. I came from a family. Everybody’s like, “Oh, I’m the first to graduate college.” That’s nice. No one even graduated high school in my family. There’s no reading. There’s no self-improvement. The only thing my family read is the Bible and that can be taken to a crazy extreme. Tim Ferriss: You also didn’t go to prison. David Senra: Exactly. My grandfather, I shouldn’t even say this publicly anymore. You have a big podcast. I would say stuff on small podcasts and forget that things get bigger later on. I say crazy stuff that I should not be saying, but whatever. We’re too late now. My grandfather, my father, my brother, I remember being in high school and hearing “bang.” Five guys at 5:30 in the morning come and grab my brother and I don’t see him for a few years. That’s a fact. My point being is then I’m like, “Oh, wait.” I put this podcast out. Then, it attracts the same people that are in the books and then the fact that I could spend five hours with Michael Dell and he tweets about the podcast and he LinkedIns about it and just giving me phenomenal advice. Then, obviously we record our conversation, but before that they just want to help you because they got value from that. Tim Ferriss: Let me pause you for one second just because I want to go back to the note-taking and then converting that into some type of action. You’ve done that. You’re hitting, and you’ve had a number of these, but inflection points where now you can sit down with some of these icons and have these extended conversations. Even if you did not have that direct access, maybe your process with the note-taking wouldn’t change. I’m just curious how you read one biography or multiple biographies on a person and what the actual note-taking process looks like. I’ll volunteer what I do a lot. I use Kindle not for the convenience of the device, although that is convenient, not because I can listen on Audible or actually do it through the Kindle app and then stop and highlight things, which is also why I use it. The highlighting overall is the reason and then exporting or using something like Readwise in addition to synthesizing my highlights. I believe you also use Readwise quite a bit. I’m not sure if you still use it, but what does your process look like? I know, for instance, like Maria Popova who’s this voluminous, prodigious, genius of a writer, it used to be Brain Pickings. It’s The Marginalian now. She has a very particular process for synthesizing and putting everything together. How do you do that? David Senra: I actually think I’m going to sit down and make an episode about how I make these because I think it’s actually an older idea here that I just went through when I reread James Dyson’s autobiography. Both of them actually, but the first autobiography I’ve read like five times. The second one, I think this is the second or third time I read it. One of the genius things that he did when no one knew who he was, Dyson wasn’t a thing. Now it’s one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world. You walk into a retail store. He had one product in one market at the time and you say, “I’m going to buy a vacuum cleaner.” Five of them kind of look the same and then you have this alien-looking thing at the end. Then, what he said, he’s like, “Hey, what is the advantage I have? I’m going against all these huge multinational conglomerates and I’m just some bloke that cares about vacuum cleaners in this remote part of England.” He convinced all the retailers to let him write a story on a little leaflet and they would hang it on the handle of the Dyson. It tells a story. It’s in 200 or 300 words of who made it, why they made it, why they love it so much, and why you should buy it. People buy stories. That’s what I was saying. It’s like that’s not the first time I came across that idea. You go back to the early 1900s and there’s this guy named Claude Hopkins. I am always interested. You are — Tim Ferriss: I read — David Senra: Scientific Advertising? Tim Ferriss: Yes, in the very beginning. David Senra: I’m always interested in who influences the influencers, right? Let me give you an example. Tim Ferriss: God, I haven’t thought of that name in so many years. David Senra: I have so much shit on this guy. Tim Ferriss: Claude Hopkins. David Senra: I became obsessed. We were talking before we recorded that we both really, I won’t speak for you, love and admire, and mine is borderline idolize, Charlie Munger. If I can only learn from one person for the rest of my life, if you could say, “Hey, you can only read this guy’s words. Pick one person,” I’m picking Munger. I just love everything about him and the idea that I got to meet him is insane, absolutely insane. When I’m reading about Munger and Buffett I’m like, “Man, these guys are really genius.” I didn’t know anything at this time. It’s like 10 years ago and I’m like, “These guys are genius.” Then, they kept mentioning this guy named Henry Singleton over and over again and they will tell you. If you admire somebody, what I think is hugely important, go. They will tell you who influenced them and then you have to go and read about these people. Then, you’ll find who influenced them and you realize that the ideas didn’t start with them. They don’t start with us. They can’t die with us either. You have to push them forward down the generations. I’m like, “Oh, this guy’s interesting. Charlie Munger said that the smartest person he ever met was Henry Singleton. He’s best friends with Buffett. Buffett’s obviously, how did he say that?” Then, Buffett says that it’s a crime that business schools don’t study Singleton. That’s hell of language. That’s — Tim Ferriss: Strong language. David Senra: Strong language, and then you start reading. I’m like, “Oh, my God, the ideas that I thought were Buffett and Munger’s were Singleton’s.” You see this over and over again. I was obsessed. Another guy that Buffett introduced me to was David Ogilvy. David Ogilvy I think is one of the best writers I’ve ever come across and Buffett keeps mentioning this to shareholders. He’s like, “This genius named David Ogilvy.” Why is Buffett calling this guy a genius? Who is this guy? Tim Ferriss: I read Ogilvy’s stuff at the same time that I read Hopkins. David Senra: If you read Ogilvy, what does he talk about? He’s like, “That’s the genius. I’m not the genius. I’m just regurgitating Claude Hopkins’s work.” Then, he tells the story of Albert Lasker who made more money. There’s all these, let’s call them a dozen great advertising agency founders, the Mad Men era. The one that made the most money was this guy named Albert Lasker and he had the simplest business, no art department, no research department. He had Claude Hopkins writing copy and his words rang the cash register. If you can bring more customers to businesses, they will pay you a lot of money and it turns out Claude Hopkins wrote this book called Scientific Advertising. He would try to publish it. It was essentially the secrets of Lasker and Lasker hid it in a safe for 20 years. Tim Ferriss: I’ll get that right over to the agent. Stick that in the safe. David Senra: If you read this, he’s like, “Hey, it may be boring to you.” He uses an example of Schlitz Beer, right? They were fifth in the market share and they hire Hopkins. They’re like, “We want to sell more beer.” He’s like, “Okay.” He does the same thing he does. He does a lot of research and he goes and he tours their distillery. He’s blown away by like that we triple distill the water and I don’t know how beer is made. I don’t even drink that much, but he explains the entire process. Claude’s like, “This is amazing. Why don’t you guys talk about this?” He goes, “Because our process isn’t different than any other distillery.” He goes, “Yeah, but no one’s telling that story.” He writes these huge, essentially 1,500 words, 2,000 words of this is how the beer that you’re about to drink is made and goes from fifth to first because people buy stories. To answer your question, I think what I should do is sit down. Maybe I’ll just clip this and be like, “Okay, this is how I make the podcast or how I consume information.” I think me and you share a love of the writing of Cormac McCarthy. Tim Ferriss: Sure, my God. David Senra: He said — Tim Ferriss: Beautiful and brutal in equal measure. David Senra: Yes, he said something that’s fascinating where he — Tim Ferriss: The Road, Blood Meridian, I mean there are many other examples. David Senra: All The Pretty Horses, The Border Trilogy, just everything the guy just read everything. He’s just incredible. The Road, No Country for Old Men. I saw the movie before I saw the book. It’s crazy how they barely had to change any words. It’s like he wrote a script, so he said something that was fascinating, that subconscious is older than language. And they’re like, “How’d you write Blood Meridian?” He goes, “I didn’t.” He’s like, “I sat there and it came all from my subconscious. I eliminated anything that got in the way of it.” Right? Tim Ferriss: And you must have a busy therapist. David Senra: I couldn’t imagine within that guy’s head to write that book. The Judge. The Judge is the craziest — Tim Ferriss: Really dark. So dark. Anyway. David Senra: So anyways, so I am all intuition, all feeling. So basically what I do is I sit down with a book and usually, I do this physically and it’s like I’m doing arts and crafts over here. I sit down with a physical book because that’s how I fell in love with reading. I don’t have memories before I had love of reading and I think one of the best things that ever happened to me is the fact that I don’t know why reading grabbed a hold of me since I was four or five years old. So my mom was dying of breast cancer. What I said about the only thing they read is the Bible that you could take that to an extreme because she tried for two years. She tried to pray her cancer away. And by that time, by the time we convinced her to see an oncologist, the word he used was the horses out of the barn. And this is the most grueling way to die when it spreads to your bones. It’s just like that happens. I’m calling you to put a pillow over my face. I’m just not going through that. It was just a terrible thing to see. But one of the thing she said, she’s like, you’ve just been like this forever. You were a kid and you’d read the back of cereal boxes. I’d walk in every single room. I did this when I come in here and just automatically read everything that’s on the walls. So I have no idea where this came from. I didn’t choose the passion of reading. It chose me. And all of it is intuition. I sit down with a physical book, that’s how I fell in love with reading. I sit down with pen. Tim Ferriss: Your mom would bring you to the bookstore, right? David Senra: Yes. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They won’t kick you out for reading. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. And the library. And then I remember the first time it was like this maybe before I even knew words because I was obsessed with Where’s Waldo. So it was my first memory. So you’re not reading anything, you’re just finding the guy with the striped shirt or a striped sweater. So basically I sit down with a book, physical book, pen, six-inch ruler, Post-it notes, and scissors. And I just read and I don’t think, and if something jumps out to me, I highlight it, and then whatever pops to my mind. And normally as our mutual friends like Patrick, Chris, Rick, they’ll all see this. It’s just like I’m not actually listening to what you’re saying. There’s an idea behind it. Tim Ferriss: Meaning you’re not taking what the author says literally. You’re looking at the idea behind — David Senra: I’m just looking for the essence. So if me and Rick are talking about a giant deal that he wants to invest in, I’m thinking about how that’s similar to how Fred Smith built FedEx or how Jim Casey built UPS or how Buffett thought about buying See’s Candy. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do with the Post-it notes and the scissors and the ruler? David Senra: So basically, I underline that sentence and then whatever popped in my mind and I’m like, oh, this is kind of like James J. Hill when he was building the only profitable successful American railroad and you just write down whatever comes to mind. Tim Ferriss: On the Post-it? David Senra: On the Post-it. Tim Ferriss: And that goes on the page. David Senra: It goes on the page. David Senra: So then I’m writing it down and then I might have three sentences, but the Post-it note’s three by five, so I have to cut it. It has to be clean, it has to look good. There’s a beauty to it. I am irrational, crazy when it comes to this stuff. This is why I think I picked up on your work right away. I see a fellow nutcase and obsessive we’re like, I hand edit, now, my transcripts. So everybody’s like, “You should outsource it to AI. You should outsource it to India.” No, I have to touch it. I have to feel it. I just love it. I’m not doing it to do it quicker. I like what Jerry Seinfeld says. “The hard way is the right way.” I like the hard way. This also goes back to obviously have some kind of dark thing driving me, which we can dive into if you want. So then you go through the entire book and so then I have to take pictures of it into the Readwise app because you do it the smarter way. Kindle will just automatically go to Readwise. Tim Ferriss: Well, I still use physical. I’ll explain. I can trade. I’ll tell you how I use physical. David Senra: You want to go do it now, or you want — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Well, okay, so don’t lose your place. David Senra: I won’t. Tim Ferriss: All right, you got the scissors. I want to know about the ruler. Oh, I guess the ruler. David Senra: Straight lines. It has to be straight. It has to be beautiful. Tim Ferriss: So we both have pretty moderate to severe OCD. I remember when I was diagnosed by the psychiatrist who was doing some preliminary formality of taking me through these assessments before I was going to have this experimental brain stimulation, “Send me experimental.” And he had to check the boxes and went through these hours and hours of stuff and he’s like, “Why don’t you to take a seat? If we need to take a break, I understand.” And he gave me this OCD diagnosis. I’m like, “Yeah, what else is new? Keep going.” David Senra: “I knew this about myself.” Tim Ferriss: “Yeah, I don’t need time.” The way I use physical, and I do use physical still quite a bit, is I will, and this is another question that maybe you can answer when you pick back up is how a second or third reading differs from the first. Because when I read it the first time, I’m doing something very similar to you. I’m underlining things or if that’s just too much work, the book is actually a gem and it has a lot. Then I will just bracket it on the side of the paragraph so that I know what the highlight is. Then I will go through, if I read it a second time, and I will put T2 in a circle next to the things that still stuck out on a second reading. Now sometimes you’re just a different person if you read it five years later and your lived experience and your position is life is different. But if I’m doing it in somewhat rapid succession, I want to see what sticks on a second or third reading. So you’ll see T2, T3, etc. Sometimes, it’s just fun to see how I change over time with The Moral Letters to Lucilius by Seneca the Younger — people can find it in all sorts of compendiums. I put out a free PDF called The Tao of Seneca. I like to just see where I am at different points in my life, what resonates. And then, typically with any physical book I’m creating, I just did this with a book I finished yesterday called Deep Tech by Pablos Holman where I’m creating an index in the front. So whenever there’s a page that really, really sticks out, I’ll write down like 168, whatever it might be. Someone I want to look up, someone like a Claude Hopkins, whose name gets dropped and I’m like, that seems important. All right. And so I have this index and then I’ll take a photograph of the index just in case I lose the book, which has happened. And that’s always painful. I also will have, I’ll make a little box on the bottom right-hand corner of some of the front matter pages and I’ll put next steps there. David Senra: Wait, what’s the front matter? Tim Ferriss: So the front matter would be the copyright page, the title page, the pages that don’t really have any content on them. Maybe there’s the dedication page like ‘To Mom’, it’s like, okay, that’s a blank page that I can use. So on the bottom right-hand corner, just two lines that create sort a box, I’ll write down next steps. So for every book, not every book, in some cases if it’s just for pleasure and it’s fiction, but even then sometimes ideas will pop into mind. I’ll be like, okay, what is at least one kind of next step? Maybe it’s looking up someone like Claude Hopkins. Maybe it’s an action, maybe it’s a phone call, maybe it’s an email. But along the lines of David Allen and Getting Things Done, it’s like one physical next action. And so I almost always have that in nonfiction books. So that’s photos. I take photos of all that. I used to put it all into Evernote. I still sometimes do that because I’ve been using it forever and I have thousands of them. But you’re the last Evernote standing. I might be, yeah, I use scannable to get it into Evernote, but the point is I have a way to then OCR it so I can search it. All right, back to — David Senra: So that’s basically what I have to do now, which takes an unbelievable amount of time. But again, then now, so I’ve already read it one time. Now I have to input it into Readwise, right? So you take a picture of it and it’s laborious and now I’ve read it for the second or maybe a third time. Then you see on page and then you have to make sure that it matches up between the page and what’s on your screen. And so you’re reading it over and over again. So then I get it all into Readwise, then I will go back — Tim Ferriss: Do you want to take a sidebar just to explain what Readwise is? David Senra: Readwise is essentially just a way to keep track of your notes and highlights from everything you read. And now they’re expanding out because it turns out the total just on the market for people that want to keep highlights and notes, first of all, how many people are reading books now? That number is dwindling unfortunately. And then of that subset of smaller and dwindling people, how many read as much as you and I do? And then they want to actually research essentially giant, searchable database of everything you’ve ever read. It’s super valuable and they charge like $99 a year for it. So now basically they were running this for six years. They have a new web reader app and they said they made more money in six months from that than they didn’t Readwise for six years. This is obviously not a lot of people that want to do this. The thing that we’re describing doing. So then I used to read the physical book because actually let’s back up and I want to tell you the role that you played. And don’t let me forget where I’m at though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I won’t. David Senra: So I went to a shitty college because I remember when I was in your senior year, I went to public high school and everybody’s like, “Where are you going to school?” And I didn’t understand what they meant. I’m like, “The one I can drive to, the one I can go to at night because I have to work during the day. I don’t know where you’re talking about.” I didn’t know. I got kicked out of my house when I was 18 and I had to live in student housing. Tim Ferriss: Why did you get kicked out? David Senra: My mom’s side of the family has severe mental illness and just some of the worst people you’ve ever met. And they just had this belief that you kick your kids out when you’re 18, it’s just like — Tim Ferriss: Out of the nest. David Senra: It is not even that. It’s like they pick a fake fight and you have somebody that’s very, I’m not, that was the point of contention between my mom is she had undiagnosed mental illness for sure, maybe not schizophrenic, definitely bipolar. Her sister was schizophrenic. And listen man, as you get older, at the time I had a lot of anger, super, a lot of anger, didn’t understand why they’re doing what you’re doing and then you get older and then you have your own kids. So I went through this crazy thing where I think I hated them even more because when my daughter was born, I’m like, I remember seeing her for the first time. I was like, you think you love a woman? No. Enzo Ferrari has this great line that “It’s impossible for a man to love a woman. The only true love he has is for his kids.” And I understand what he meant. I think Ryan Reynolds said it best where it’s like “I never thought I’d love anybody as much as I love Blake Lively. And then she gave birth to our daughter and as soon as I looked at her daughter, I knew if we were ever under attack, I would use Blake as a human shield to protect that baby.” It’s funny, but it’s literally when I heard him say that, I go, “Yes.” Tim Ferriss: Right. David Senra: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: So that makes the memory all the more painful. David Senra: Then I was like, how did you do this to your children? And then you get — there’s another — you get more experience and then you’re like, yes, but imagine you grew up like they did, poor white trash. My grandfather raped all his daughters, including my mothers. Raped all of his daughters, raped his gr — I didn’t know about this until after he died or else I would’ve been the one to put them in his grave, raped his daughters, raped his granddaughters. They lived in this shitty house in Indiana with one bathroom that was in — there was two-bedroom, she had three sisters. The only bathroom is in my gr — I call them grandparents. I hate them with all of my being in their room. And so if you wanted to go in the bedroom at night, he was a monster. They would urinate in cups and pour it out the window. So again, it doesn’t excuse the bad decisions that they made and the unhappy marriage my parents had and all this other crap. It was just like, “All right, imagine that. Imagine that. You destroyed your kids. That person was supposed to protect them and I can’t even talk about this.” So anyways, we would fight a lot and she’d be alternate depending on the day, she’d be the kindest person in the world or a storm. And so the unfortunate part was when she got diagnosed with cancer, we hadn’t spoken for six months, so she only survived another, I think, two years. So that means the last two and a half years I missed — what? That’s 20 percent, 25 percent of her life. And somebody’s like, “What were you guys fighting over?” I was like, “The sad thing is I don’t remember.” But I was not one to let, I was very hardheaded. And so she had some weird fight with me. I don’t remember what it was. And then she was like, “You’re not allowed to live here.” Kicked me out, I didn’t have anything. So anyways, I went to, I lived in student housing and that was the first time — they randomly assign you a roommate and it was like the son of a rich rancher because our fridge was full of all this meat stuff, which is bad because it was the summer where Florida got hit by four hurricanes and all the meat went rotting. Tim Ferriss: Spoiled. David Senra: Oh, yes, it was disgusting, but I didn’t know that there were people legitimately, this makes me sound like an absolute moron, but I didn’t know that there were people that only went to college because my roommate didn’t have a job. He just drank and went to — I’m like, “What else do you do?” He was like, “What?” This is crazy. So I don’t know where I was going with that. Tim Ferriss: You were taking a pause on Readwise and multiple reads and you’re like, “I’ve got to tell you how I found you.” David Senra: Oh, okay. So again, I’m in a crappy school. It’s a state school in Orlando, UCF. I almost said UFC where it’s MMA. That would’ve been probably more useful now. So UCF, and this is when Facebook was coming out, but Facebook was only at the fancy schools. Tim Ferriss: Yes, right. It was very much at the fancy schools. David Senra: We didn’t have Facebook, we had MySpace. And so remember you’d go and there would be music playing on somebody’s profile? Well, people would, they would list their favorite movies and favorite books. And I think I was looking at a girl’s — probably — profile. And under favorite books, it said 4-Hour Workweek. I’m like, that’s a great title, what is that? And I immediately order it on Amazon and then I start reading it, obviously. Then that book inspired, I don’t know, 25 million people, maybe even more, but now and then I start consuming all your stuff. So I’d buy all your books. I bought your TV show. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I appreciate that. David Senra: Sometimes I’ll forget because you go on like — whatever, it’s not called iTunes anymore. And I don’t buy anything because everything streams. I’m like Tim Ferriss, [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: I know from the Natural History Museum back in the day. David Senra: So I was obsessed with podcasts, I discovered in 2010, and before I started mine in 2016, I listened to thousands of them. And you had one that changed my life, which was when you did Jocko. And that was 2015 if I remember correctly. And you told him to start a podcast and I think Rogan told him to do it as well. And he’s like, well, if I got these two guys, obviously he’s smart. Just take the advice. And I started listening to his podcast and he changed format. But in the beginning it was just him doing, he would read a first-person account, so an autobiography of somebody in combat and I could not believe what I was hearing. And so what I would do is I’d listen maybe a hundred of the books or I listen to a hundred of his episodes and maybe buy a dozen of the books. So you learn, even on the episodes, you don’t read the book, you learn so much and you’re inspired. And in the books, he kept introducing me all kinds of crazy stories and I was like, Hey. A couple months later then obviously I had started reading biographies because your friend Kevin Rose did this excellent interview with Elon Musk, we can talk about from 2012. And I was like, what if I do Jocko’s format, but I’m interested in four things. I’m interested in reading, history, podcasts, and entrepreneurship. And so if you look at it’s like it just sits in between those four. And I started doing that and essentially I was just imitating Jocko and no one gave a shit for five and a half years. Tim Ferriss: Yes. Wow. What a wild story. So I want to dive into that. The interview with Jocko, I owe special thanks to, I think it was Peter Attia — David Senra: He was. Tim Ferriss: Who made the introduction. David Senra: He said, just trust me on this. Tim Ferriss: And — David Senra: Then didn’t he just show up at your house or something? Tim Ferriss: Yes, we hung out in San Francisco. I remember exactly which coffee shop we went to. And I made the mistake. I wasn’t even thinking properly. I had a camo shirt on and I was like, I can’t believe I wore a fucking camo shirt to meet someone as legitimate as Jocko Willink. And I was just like, oh, facepalm. But we ended up connecting. That was his first ever public interview, which is wild. David Senra: One of the best ones ever done. Tim Ferriss: Oh. I mean he really brought the heat as Jocko — David Senra: He’s my alarm every morning. He’s like, “Get up.” I swear to God, I’m not joking. He’s been my alarm for half a decade. He yells at me. I’m like, “You’re right.” Tim Ferriss: Yes, Extreme Ownership still highly, highly, highly recommend to everyone. And if you want to hear me and Jocko go toe to toe, not really toe to toe, we’re sort of shoulder to shoulder with a book we did Musashi. David Senra: Episode 100. Tim Ferriss: Episode 100, which was like four and a half, five hours long going through this historical novel about the most famous swordsman in Japanese history. David Senra: I read that because of that episode. Tim Ferriss: Oh, so good. David Senra: I think I read the audiobook first. It’s 60 hours long or something. Tim Ferriss: It’s really long. And keeping in mind, this was originally published in Japanese in a country of whatever the population is like 120, 150 million. I think it sold 80 to a hundred million copies. I mean something just completely insane. And who knows, I might be getting that off, but the numbers are just astonishing as a ratio of the total population. So five and a half years, how do you explain no one giving a shit for five and a half years? In other words, was there something that happened, a decision you made, something that changed things around the five and a half year mark? Was it a change in technology? David Senra: Oh, change in business model. Tim Ferriss: What happened? Yes. David Senra: Literally I was doing nothing different, changing business model. So you remember podcasting back in there, because you were one of the OGs and you had this massive audience. Your blog was crazy. You were huge and still are. And I was none of those things. I was a weird introvert. I didn’t have any social media, I didn’t know anything about the internet. I don’t know how to describe. I just would like to read and record a podcast in my kitchen on a hundred-dollar microphone. And I remember calling around and trying to figure out what’s the business model here? And everybody was like, “Oh, it’s ads.” I’m like, “Oh, that’s great.” And so at the time there was these ad networks, essentially they just sell ads for you and they’re like, we’d love to work with you, you just have to have 50,000 downloads per show. And I go, “What? I will never! 50,000?” It seemed like such a big number. “That will never ever happen.” Tim Ferriss: In the universe of podcasts, it’s still a big number. David Senra: Yes, but now there’s a million. Think about how many people listen to The Tim Ferriss Show and there’s millions and millions and millions of people over the course of a year or whatever. So I was like, “Oh, my God, that’s never going to happen.” And so then you’d say, “Okay, well, what can you do?” And back then it’d be affiliate. So remember, Audible scaled massively. People don’t realize how big businesses can get on the back of podcasts, and how many have. Audible was, it was on every — Dan Carlin had one ad and it was an Audible ad. Tim Ferriss: It was Audible. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: They were very smart about that. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yes. They’ve been able to change a lot of their economics — David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: For the better, for Audible and Amazon since capturing more market share. But they did an excellent job of marketing and advertising. David Senra: They were on every single podcast. And so I did that. And then there was this company called Blinkist, which was a — Tim Ferriss: Summaries? David Senra: Summary, 10-minute summary app for business books, non-fiction books. And that blew my mind because so you only got paid on sales and they would show you not the people, but where the country was. And I remember the first time somebody in Japan bought, I’m like, I’m sitting in Miami in my kitchen, “Great acoustics, by the way, you idiot.” On a hundred-dollar mic with no pop filter, no nothing. There was nothing out there, there was no — editing a podcast now with the script and all the AI tools, it’s like magic compared to what we had to do back then. And I was like, what? Somebody in Japan listened to this thing? This was crazy. So the one idea I had, there is this, I actually got the business model from a socialist podcast. Tim Ferriss: Might’ve been the beginning of the troubles. David Senra: So there was this, for a long time when I opened a browser, my homepage would be this thing called Graphtreon. Graphtreon is essentially they use the Patreon API and you see people building membership communities. And what was interesting about them is people sell comic books, they would sell podcasts, they would sell newsletters, videos, and the most popular category was podcasts. I’m like, that’s weird. And so at the time, this podcast called Chapo Trap House was the number one and they had 25,000 people. Tim Ferriss: Thing is on Patreon. David Senra: Yes. And the only way you see this is because Graphtreon would aggregate the data for you and present it to you. And so, at the time, I think they had 20,000 paid subscribers, at least $5 a month. And their business model is simple. Every other podcast you have to pay for, so you can listen to half them for free. If you want more, just pay five bucks a month and you can listen to it in a podcast player. Like anything else, you just have to go through the paywall. And every month I’m watching and the number gets higher and higher and higher. Now if you pull up Graphtreon, I think the number one is Shane Gillis, I think he’s got 120,000 paid subscribers. So I was like, oh, there’s like a business here with what if I had a subscription podcast? So it’s one thing to pay five bucks a month for a comedy podcast, but my podcasts are about business. If there’s ideas on this podcast that will make people more money, which is essentially what business education comes down to, you want to be more successful at what you do, there’s some kind of, hopefully you see a better economic outcome for yourself and your family. I was like, what if I could just sell subscriptions? Because I’m not selling enough Audible subscriptions and Blinkist, that’s not going to happen. And my idea was, I think I was completely in love with podcasting and still am. It’s the only thing I think about. I work on seven days a week. It’s completely taken over my life. And my idea was I don’t even have to be wealthy, I just have to do this for a living. It has to come out of me. It’s like I had no control over this. And I was like, maybe I can make dentist money. So my idea was like, I bet you I can sell 3,000 paid subscriptions at a hundred dollars a pop, make 300 grand a year. And then I also have a lot of self-confidence like, well, if I could sell 3,000, I could sell 20,000, and then maybe I can sell as many as Chapo can and then I’m making two million. This is the idea I had. And so my idea was the genius idea I had was like, “Hey, your most valuable asset you have, which is your podcasts, they are easy to share and everything else, let’s put a big wall in front of that.” And so I put a giant paywall in front of it and obviously it slows growth because how are you going to share the episode? And the one benefit I had, which really kept me going, and I don’t think I would’ve quit anyways, I really don’t think I had any other option, but was that we don’t know who’s going to listen to this one. We just see numbers on the screen. But with a subscription, you see the email address and the emails were the top founders and top VCs and I had a very small audience and one of them was our mutual friend, Patrick O’Shaughnessy. And I was a huge fan of Patrick. And I saw, I’m not going to repeat his email address here, but I know what the, I was like, I saw that come across and there were so few, I saw every single one. You’re getting like 10 a day, I don’t know, five a day or something like that paid. And I’m like, oh, my God, Patrick bought one. He didn’t know who I was. He didn’t know I was a big fan of his, didn’t know anything. I had no followers. I think I had 7,000 followers across all, every one of my accounts. And I was trying really hard back then. And he goes, “I never find good podcasts to listen to. I think David Senra’s Founders podcast is excellent. You should listen to it.” And he linked to that one and Estée Lauder and I could not believe it. Because I was like, why do I have these mentions on Twitter? What is a mention? I don’t get mentions. What is this new thing? And then I log into my email and it’s just because back then you would get an email every time you get a new pay subscription and off of one tweet of an endorsement by people. This is why you and Andrew are kind of like the male Oprah. And I mean that in the — you know how much shit I’ve bought because you told me that it’s good. Why? Because of the trust that, people chase numbers. It’s like that. You’re not chasing numbers, you’re chasing trust and relationships. I love what Warren Buffett said: “A brand is a promise.” The fact that you guys have such high standards, I’ve never bought anything like what the hell was Tim thinking? And so that’s what makes you so valuable. So Patrick extended that trust to me where I logged into my email and you couldn’t stop scrolling. You couldn’t stop scrolling. And so I screenshotted that because — Tim Ferriss: Patrick’s a good dude. Very smart too. Invest Like the Best. David Senra: Yes. You did an excellent episode with him for when you hit your 10-year anniversary. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yes. 10 years.David Senra: And then I was a huge NBA fan and the person that found me, that’s been really, really helpful. When I had 1,500 listeners, guy named Sam Hinkie, former general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, very, very intelligent, intense, and kind of reclusive guy. Now he’s really hard to get to. And we had talked a bunch and he’s just like, “I really think you have something here. I think you’re — what you’re doing is important and I’ve tried to help you as much as I can.” And I knew him and Patrick were friends, and I screenshotted Patrick’s tweet. I was like, “Look what your friend Patrick did.” Sam didn’t say anything. He just put it, and again, Patrick trusts Sam and Sam’s telling Patrick, “This guy’s worth your time.” He put us in group chat. He goes, “You two need to know each other.” And I was like, “Patrick, I’m a huge fan. Love to talk to you.” And Patrick doesn’t have a calendar. So he’s like, “What about right now?” And I was like, “Well, let me look at my calendar.” Nothing. Nothing. Literally nothing. I was like, “Yes.” We talked for the first, first time we talked was an hour and a half. And we get to the end, he goes, “I thought I was in the podcast.” And then we become friends. And then I joined his network and then he just poured gasoline on a promising spark. Tim Ferriss: Was he the one who convinced you to remove the wall? Or how did you end up — David Senra: No. So a friend of mine, again, this is the sad part about becoming, getting more following is so many of my close friends now came from DMs. And now you can’t do that. You can’t even look at mentions. Tim Ferriss: Yes. David Senra: I’d be curious. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t work. David Senra: Yes, it’s it kind of rule. It’s such a magical thing. And now because, Tim Ferriss: Yes, well once verified could be purchased, it destroyed the utility of meeting those people on. David Senra: It’s like what Charlie Munger said, if you have a bunch of raisins in just a few turds, you still got turds and you could have 99 percent of the people are nice to you. And then it’s these psychos and you’re like, I can’t read my mentions anymore. Can’t check my DMs. It’s sad.But one of, I met a couple friends through them and again, I was grinding out hundred-dollar-year subscriptions, just like going to the factory every day trying to sell a few more. And one of my friends told me what one of his friends’ company just paid to advertise on one of the biggest business podcasts. And the number was like, what, what did you just say? And then Sam and other people like Patrick, they’re just like, “This is weird thing that you’re doing. Why don’t you just sell ads like everybody else?” And I was like, “Look at China. They’re 90 percent subscription to your podcast.” Like, “Yeah, but you’re American, you idiot.” And so I came up with all these crazy, because I can be very convincing in the opposite direction. It doesn’t have to be a good idea, I can talk myself into good ideas, but I can talk myself into bad ideas too. And so eventually I called Patrick one day and I was just like, “Man, I am fighting with one hand behind my back. This is really, really difficult. I think I’m going to make an ad based version of Founders.” He’s like, “Yeah, no shit. I’ve been telling you to do this forever.” And then I was like, “And I’d like it to be on your network.” And he’s like, “Ooh, that’s interesting.” And again, he’s just a good dude, and he’s like, “Yeah, but I own all podcasts on my network. Will you sell me equity?” And I don’t know why I said this, and I was like, “No.” It was crazy, and I’d had all these acquisition investment offers up until that point, because obviously everybody in the audience likes to do deals, so they like trying to allocate capital. Tim Ferriss: That’s their sport. David Senra: Yeah, and I was like, “No, no, no.” It wasn’t a business thing to me, it’s like a special thing. It’s like part of my soul. Michael Dell has this great answer when he was fighting with Carl Icahn when, and they’re like, “Why don’t you just start another company?” And he’s like, “I like this company. First of all, it has my name on it,” and he goes, “I’m going to care about this company after I’m dead.” So that’s how I feel, it’s a rational love that I have for this. And so I was like, “I don’t want to sell equity, but.” He’s like, “What do you want?” I was like, “I want you to help amplify my audience and connect me with first-rate advertisers. Then we could just share ad revenue.” And one call he’s like, “Done.” That completely changed everything. That was four years ago. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Thank God for Patrick, huh? David Senra: Oh, for sure. I talk to him almost every day. We’re like brothers, I called him this morning. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. He’s a very, very good guy. Tim Ferriss: Well, let’s just, actually, I’m going to zoom into your expertise, subject matter for a second, and then I want to talk more about podcasting, but just so it doesn’t become too much inside baseball, I do want to come back and talk about podcasting. But you have mentioned a number of different names at the top of your list, people to learn from. Where does Edwin Land fit into that, and who is Edwin Land? David Senra: Edwin Land is the patron saint of Founders. I want a picture of him in my house like The Last Supper, it would just be Edwin Land in the middle like Jesus. Again, I’m very interested in who influences the influencers, and where do these ideas actually come from? And Steve Jobs, if you have a Mount Rushmore of greatest entrepreneurs, his face has got to be on it, undoubtedly. He created the most successful product in history. I think he did it for the right reasons. I think he’s a very fascinating person, obviously incredibly flawed as a human, which he even said. But what’s fascinating is if you go back, and which I do, is when I read a biography of somebody, I will make a list going back to your outline of what I’ll do in the front of the books, which you called, what’s? Tim Ferriss: Front matter. David Senra: Front matter. I didn’t even know that term till now, thank you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I will write down all the other founders or all the other people they’ll talk about. And so I just did this with James Dyson. He’s obsessed with Buckminster Fuller and Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Jeremy Fry and Alec Issigonis, and all these people. He just repeats them over and over again and you just realize, oh, he studied these guys and then took their ideas and said, those ideas are good. I’ll use them and then make $60 billion or whatever his company’s worth. Tim Ferriss: Everyone should read about Buckminster Fuller. David Senra: I haven’t read the book yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I’ve read his ideas, but not the book that James read when he was in college. It’s fascinating to me how it’s almost all — and they usually find it early. I had lunch with Sam Zell. I’m talking to him. Tim Ferriss: How did he make his money, for people who don’t know? David Senra: Well, people consider him an investor. He calls himself an entrepreneur. He called himself an entrepreneur. What he’s most well known for is in 2007, he sold, I think the biggest real estate company in history for 38 billion to Blackstone. He tipped at the very top of the market, but he just likes to essentially buy businesses, try to make them grow. He would sell some, so that’s why people consider him an investor. But he considered himself an entrepreneur originally. By the time I met him, he had 61 years of experience as an entrepreneur. And my favorite entrepreneurs are I love talking to these people that have 40, 50, I’m not interested in the startup founder at all. This 25-year-old kid that thinks he’s smart, he doesn’t have enough experience yet. Life is going to teach you what you need. Tim Ferriss: People who’ve ridden many multiple macroeconomic cycles who have had to contend with different challenges at different points in their lives, not just when they have no responsibilities and no dependence, et cetera. David Senra: Well, he says something in his autobiography that you were speaking to earlier. He’s like, “Yeah, earlier in my life, my career fought my marriages and my career won and that’s why I’ve been married three times.” The very current theme is that you look at life as everything that’s not work as an unpleasant distraction, and you wonder why your relationship’s broken because you’re not spending any time there. Of course, that’s the outcome, and they all make this mistake over and over again. So what’s fascinating about this is we’ll go back to Edwin Land in a minute. Sam Zell. In his biography, he’s like, “Dude, I’m in college.” This guy was making millions of dollars a year when he was in law school. That’s how good of an entrepreneur he was from day one. Tim Ferriss: Was that real estate? David Senra: Yeah. He was developing, I think student housing at the time, I think the student housing, but he was also doing deals. He’s just a very gifted deal maker, and you see this with Rick. Understanding, you’ll bring something to Rick and he’ll be like, “Oh, here’s 10 things that are important.” Tim Ferriss: Do you want to explain who Rick is briefly? David Senra: His name is Rick Gerson. He’s one of my closest friends. You’ve known him for what? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know, 15, 20 years, a long time. David Senra: 15, 20 years, he’s one of the most generous, thoughtful, and also simultaneously super intense people I know. Tim Ferriss: He’s a master of finance, came out of this just sort of amazing training environment. We can just call that for what it is for now in simplicity and is one also of the best connected humans I’ve ever met.He identifies, there’s one thing. He learned that from Sam, and then Sam learned that from this guy named Jay Pritzker. It’s very fascinating, so. Tim Ferriss: Chicago royalty. David Senra: Yes, 100 percent. So I actually just backed, it’s not a Kickstarter, but it’s almost like this. There’s no biographies of Jay, and so there’s a guy named Rockwood Notes that essentially put his hat out. He’s like, “Hey, I want to do this, but I need to make at least, I think, 40,000 a year to write this book,” and he’s selling $800 or a thousand dollars a year subscriptions. I was like, “Yeah, I’ll obviously sign up for this. I want a Jay Pritzker biography.” So Sam Zell in his autobiography, he’s like, “Yeah, I read this book by William Zeckendorf and it changed my life because there’s one idea in this book.” It’s what Charlie Munger said, there’s ideas worth billions in a $30 history book. There was this thing called Hawaiian technique. William Zeckendorf was this real estate developer in New York, and he came from nothing and then made a lot of money, then lost it all, and then made a lot of money, then lost it all again and dies with no money, so you want to avoid that too. But he had this thing called the Hawaiian technique, which was, hey, if you just parcel out a building and you sell the different parts to whoever values it more, you’ll make more money. So the lease is valued higher by these guys, and the land is valued higher, and maybe the commercial real estate there or whatever, he just would break it apart like Legos and sell it independently and make a little money. What Sam realized, he started using that real estate and he goes, “Oh, this works in business too.” He’d buy business. It’s like maybe you want the IP, maybe you want the talent, maybe you want the actual physical assets. And he’d do this over and over again. So I remember telling Sam to his face, and Sam had no filter, and he was exactly who you thought he was. If you watched any videos, he’s just like this and I go, “Yeah, I bought that book that you recommended.” He goes, “Did you read it?” I go, “No.” He goes, “Read it,” he’s got the gravelly voice. “Read it.” I was like, “Oh, shit, okay.” And I read it as soon as I went home and started reading it. Sam Zell tells you to read a book, just read a book. But the reason I bring this up is because you’ll see this over and over again. They’ll find somebody early. You can go back and read this Playboy interview just for the, I hope when you, it’s just for the interview. Tim Ferriss: Just for the interview. David Senra: It’s not for anything else, of Steve Jobs when he’s 25, 26, and he’s talking about the fact that we have the wrong role models and heroes as a society. We want to be. Now, he’d say — you want to be YouTubers or something. We want to be athletes. We want to be all these other things. We should want to be Edwin Land. And at the time, Edwin Land was the founder of Polaroid. Edwin Land’s in his seventies. Jobs meets him, spends time with him a bunch of times. Edwin Land at that time had the third most patents of any American in history. I think it was Thomas Edison, the second guy, and then Edwin Land, or maybe it’s the first guy, and then Thomas Edison, but Edwin Land was up there, and what you would realize is when Jobs goes on stage and says, “Hey, I wanted to build Apple. I wanted to build a company at the of liberal arts and technology,” and he has that, he literally puts the street sign up on there. That is literally a direct quote from Edwin Land. Edwin Land wanted to build a company at the intersection of liberal arts and technology. He wanted to make completely vertically integrated consumer products that were magical, that had a magical experience. In Edwin Land’s case, he invented the industry that he then comes to dominate. There was no such thing as instant photography. So when we’re like, how great is the iPhone compared to one that came before it? The difference is vast, but not the same thing as if me and you were hanging out before Edwin Land was on this Earth. We take a picture at a party, “How’d it come out? Well, we’ll find out two weeks from now when we get it back from Kodak.” Tim Ferriss: Turns out it was a shot of my foot. David Senra: As opposed to, “Wait a minute and we’re going to see it right here in the Polaroid.” And then dude, the amount of ideas that Jobs took from him. Go look at the freaking tables that Jobs uses when he gives presentations. The actual table, it’s the same table that Edwin Land gave when he gave presentations. Tim Ferriss: If somebody wants to study Edwin Land, where do they start? David Senra: I read this biography of Edwin Land I thought was incredible. It’s called Insisting on the Impossible. It’s the most comprehensive biography of him. People read it, they’re like, “This book sucks.” I think it’s riveting. There is a book, I think it’s called Land’s Polaroid. That’s the one I’d read because it’s only 250 pages and it’s written by a guy that worked for and with Edwin Land for 20 years. And I love those kinds of things because you see them over a decade. But my point being is Jobs was talking about this guy when he was 25. Jobs knows he’s dying when he’s working with Isaacson on the biography, he knows he’s dying and he’s still talking about Edwin Land appears in Isaacson’s biography of Jobs six times. Why is he still talking about this guy? How could you not be interested in understanding why? What is it about this guy that he admired and liked? Yeah, and he has a saying that, he has a personal motto that I love and that I try to do. And Edwin Land’s, there’s two of them. Edwin Land says, “My personal motto is very personal. It may not apply to anybody else or anybody else or any other company, but is don’t do anything that someone else can do.” The importance of differentiation. I’m shocked at how few people understand how important it is. Dyson, Dyson’s whole thing is it has to be different. Even if it’s worse, it should be different. He demands difference. He’s got a very fascinating business philosophy. Dyson’s mind’s incredible. And then the other thing is he knows because he dropped out of Harvard, he goes, “There’s something they don’t teach you at Harvard Business School, that anything worth doing is worth doing to excess.” Tim Ferriss: So how do you think about different archetypes? Perhaps that’s the best word to use within the pantheon of successful entrepreneurs. The reason I ask that is that I imagine you get questions that along the lines of, and I get questions like this also, when you look across all of the biographies, what are some of the common patterns? Give me the top five, top six, and then people want to grab that recipe. But it could be just to use a sports analogy, it’s like, all right, you’re taking the stretching routine from LeBron James, the weight training routine from Arnold Schwarzenegger and this and this and this. You’re grabbing habits from mutants that are in entirely different spheres where they have different bodies entirely and then trying to cobble it together. It may not work. That’s point number one, probably won’t work. Number two is that within the world of business advice, whether it’s autobiographies, biographies, interviews, there’s a lot that conflicts. So you have one person who says, “Anything that’s worth doing is worth overdoing,” and then you can tell who the novice is because they do too much. And I’m wondering how you think of entrepreneurship for yourself in terms of modeling different people or taking advice because you could have two people, just to use a metric that’s easy for everybody to wrap their head around two billionaires and they give you diametrically opposed advice. How do you personally pick? David Senra: There’s no formula. This is actually something, one of the things I’m so thrilled with is the fact that I’ve become friends with Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, and this is something we’re actually trying to work on together because he brings this up. He’s like, “We need alternative founder archetypes.”And back up, first of all, Daniel is an alien. There is a specific reason that I wanted him to be the very first guest on the new show is I’m able to build relationships with other people. Daniel’s very special in the sense that he’s only a few years older than me, but he’s so much more wiser than I am. I don’t know how I can put this in words, it makes sense, but because he’s founded and is still running a $120 billion company, he’s been running for 19 years, but to me, he’s still so underrated. And the thing about Daniel is not only is he wicked smart, but he’s given me some of the best advice. And he does it in a very reserved and very precise way. He’s got very clear thinking, and I just cannot get over how generous he is with his time and his advice to me. He told me one of the things that was really important, he said an offhand comment, but he’s like, “You’re really easy to understand, so therefore you’re easy to help. I know what is important to you, and so therefore you’re easy to help and you’re easy to interface with.” And so his point is every young founder thinks they have to be an Elon or Steve Jobs, and he’s like, “But I’m not like an Elon or Steve Jobs.” And the massive success, not only what he’s done for Spotify, one of the best apps ever created. I think they have the most, I think there’s only one other company in the world that has more paid subscribers than they do, and it’s Netflix. But think about the way you feel when you get done using Spotify. And this is why I like all the top people there too and they’ve also been working together for excessively a long time. Gustav, Alex, Daniel, all of them is they want you when you’re done using Spotify to feel good. If me and you spend an hour listening to our favorite music on Spotify, you feel great. You spend an hour listening to Tim Ferriss’ podcast, inspired, you feel great. An audiobook now, you feel great. I spend an hour on TikTok or Reels, I feel like shit. Like Twitter? Oh, I can’t. Tim Ferriss: It’s like the anti-therapy. David Senra: But they’re trying to put something. Tim Ferriss: If you want to send yourself backwards. David Senra: So I like what they’re doing. Tim Ferriss: Is there any other advice that has stuck from Daniel to you? David Senra: Yeah, so let’s go to the — Tim Ferriss: And then I won’t lose track of that. David Senra: The archetype I think is really important. I think you’ll really vibe with what his opinion on or his perspective on this is. Yeah, Daniel will tell you advice in a, he’s like a wise old man. I don’t know how to describe it. So one thing is implied and never explicitly stated is he just doesn’t feel he has any, there’s no ceiling on what he can achieve, or what he can learn, or the effect he can have in the world. And when you spend time with him, that is transferred to you. And it’s one of the most important things. And I don’t even know if I told him this. I have tears in my eyes thinking about it. And then I remember hanging out with him in Stockholm. He’s done phenomenal stuff with Spotify, one of the best apps ever created at best businesses. He’s wildly successful as an investor too. And so I remember asking him, this is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. And I go, “Were you always interested in investing?” Because I knew his story, we’ve talked a lot about this. And he goes, “No, I didn’t even know anything about it. I started learning.” I go, “When did you start learning?” He’s like, “2018.” I go, “How’d you start learning?” He goes, “Patrick’s podcast.” And so he would just listen to people. He’s like, “I like that idea, I’ll take that idea. Oh, I don’t like that idea, I don’t like that at all. I’ll avoid that.” And the way Patrick describes, it’s like out of anybody you know, Daniel has the ability to apply what he’s learning faster than anybody else, and at a grander scale. Tim Ferriss: I think he’s also a very, very, very good systems thinker. He is not at a risk cobbling together this sort of camel that is a horse designed by committee that has a bunch of inherent problems and conflicts within it. He’ll be able to figure out how to put pieces together from first principles that function well as a whole. David Senra: Let me tell one other piece of advice he gave me, and he tells it in a story form. This is why he is the wise old man, and essentially was, remember why people love you. You sit in a room and you read all the time, and then you make this thing on the other side that educates and inspires us and gives us energy. And as soon as you stop doing that and you start saying yes to all these distractions, and I don’t even know, I think we might’ve talked about this in the episode we did, that comes out in a few weeks, but he tells it in a story, and he tells a story from another person. So he’s not telling you, “David, go do this.” He’s like, “Let me tell you about this little genius,” or not little genius. “This guy’s really impressive. Look at what he’s accomplished and everything else.” And then the story will hit you hours later. And he’s like, “Oh, yeah, we’ve invited him to the conference over time. I’ve invited him to visit and I keep hearing no.” And I’m like, “Oh, he’s like telling me you’re saying yes to too many things.” The magic that you have is because you say no, and once you start saying yes, and you’re at every conference, you’re traveling around, you’re doing all this sort of stuff, the magic disappears. Tim Ferriss: I’m curious what you think are some of the different archetypes because I think of the 100 plus startups that I’ve invested in since 2008, and there’s a lot of variability. You’ve got the engineer, let’s call it the engineer founder, somebody like Tobi of Shopify or Luis von Ahn of Duolingo. Then you’ve got genius operator, negotiator warrior, like a Travis Kalanick, right? Very different personalities, very different superpowers. And you just go down the list and you see some people come from a finance, numbers, spreadsheet God perspective, and they just have an analytical advantage. It’s very comparable to investing in some ways, looking at the investing world. They have this analytical advantage, let’s just call it. And I was trying to pick out what, if anything, might be commonalities because you also have the crazy artists who then figures out how to harness some of their superpower. And it strikes me that there are at least two that immediately jumped to mind. One is longer term time horizon. David Senra: Those are the people I’m obsessed with. Tim Ferriss: Like the Jeff Bezos type of mindset where it’s like if you have the exact same toolkit, the exact same competency, out of the box genetically, you’re built exactly the same as someone else, but you are able to think and plan longer term, it can be a huge advantage. Second is something that you mentioned where Daniel was saying to you, “This is the magic.” Just remember this is the magic. When other opportunities, other shiny objects show up, because they will even in very early stages. And if you deviate, it’s incredibly easy to self-immolate if you lose track of that. You see that a lot when CEOs get replaced, sometimes, founder CEOs and sometimes they need to be replaced. But what else would you add to that or how would you expand on any of it?David Senra: Just look at the founders of some of the biggest companies in the world now, they would go to war against each other, so think about Oracle and Microsoft. You can’t think of two different founder archetypes than Bill Gates and Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison’s like, “I’m a sprinter. I have intense, very intense periods of work, weeks at a time, months at time, and then I need to go on my boat with a bunch of Italian models. This is how I have to live my life.” Bill Gates is, we’d be walking into this room right here, and his feet would be under the ground underneath his desk. He’s sleeping for three hours. He’s getting back up and he’s going back on the, he’s a grinder. And then you have, I’ve been trying to name some of these and I haven’t done this yet. And the problem is I never write anything, and this is all improv, but one of them was the anti-business billionaire. And so what I, in that category is these people are so obsessed about one thing and that’s the quality of the product that they’re making. They make non-financial decisions like Steve Jobs making sure that the inside of the Mac looks beautiful even though you can’t open it up and it costs more money. He doesn’t care. He wants the best product. James Dyson’s like this, he’s an anti-business billionaire. Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, anti-business billionaire. These guys, they’re obsessed with two things, quality of the product that they’re making and retaining control of their company over long term. And the funny part about this, the reason I call them anti-business billionaires is because if you make the world’s best product and you retain control over your company, you wind up with the money anyways. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I can think of a few people, I mean within my portfolio who retained a lot of their equity at least, and that’s it. Which is preserving the magic in terms of the best product. David Senra: Well look, everybody’s like, “Look at what’s happening to Larry Ellison right now.” It’s like, yeah, the guy I think they raised, I think this could be wrong, but I think Oracle raised 32 million of equity in their IPO and no more after that. And then the guy would refuse, even when they were almost going out of business in 1990, he still wouldn’t sell. They’re like, “Sell your equity.” Like, “No.” It might be worth nothing, he just wouldn’t sell it, and then he’s buying back stock. He owns, I think, 40, I think he went down to 24 percent, now he’s back to 41 percent of Oracle. The company’s 50 years old, 45 years old. I think he was 30-something when he founded the company. He’s just an anomaly. And then you have people like Elon where it’s just like, “I’m going to run.” I wouldn’t even think that’s possible, how the hell do you run seven companies at the same time? Tim Ferriss: I can barely manage three employees, I don’t know. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: I don’t have a good answer. David Senra: That is the point. I do think Daniel hit on something that no one else has put in front of me. It’s like, man, there’s not, the people are going to dominate. Obviously, Elon’s the most famous entrepreneur in the world, but even Bezos is very different. And then you have these people that some of the people just like to make money, and that is their scoreboard. This is another thing I learned from Michael Dell. There’s two things. One thing you just said: protecting the magic. The advice that Dell gave me when I had dinner with him, and he does this in story form too, because that guy’s been running his business for 41 years, 41 years. It’s insane. And his whole thing is just like, “You’re not going to be taken out by competition. You’re going to sabotage yourself.” “Entrepreneurs sabotage themselves, and the amount of people that were doing the same thing I was doing, and they were ahead of me.” This is Dell talking, “They were ahead of me, but then they got to 500 million year in revenue and they’re like, ‘I have a house on Lake Austin now.’” They’re in the same city. They’re doing the same thing as him in the same city, and they’re smoking them. They’re ahead of them by a few hundred million, and they’re like, “Oh, I can chill now.” No, you can’t, because you’ve got Michael Dell right across the river and he’s not going to chill. That guy has no chill. When I went to him, I was like, “What the?” I heard he’s got this wonderful house in Hawaii, his son was telling me about this, and we were in Austin in July. You know, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: It’s hot. David Senra: What are you doing here? And Michael’s answer is simple. He goes, “I love my business and my business is here.” He wasn’t being mean to me, he was like, “That’s a stupid question, David. I’m working. I love what I do, this is what I’m doing.” So one thing from his autobiography though is that really, I used to say it only works if you build a business that’s authentic to you. And this is why I asked you about your inner monologue earlier, because I really feel the reason people do their best work usually later in life, in business, is obviously more experienced network, finances, everything else, but I think because they know themselves better. I think me and you, if we would’ve met 10 years ago, we’d be different people and we also wouldn’t know each other. Know ourselves as much as we do now, where I think I’ve built a business and you have two based on what I know about you, completely authentic to you, and that’s the only way it’s going to work over long term. And I used to say authentic and Michael Dell’s autobiography, which he narrates by the way, the Audible’s excellent. I listened to it three times before I read it to do the episode on it. And there’s a guy named, I think Lee Walker who Michael brought in when Michael was 21. He was in his forties, and he was an older, wiser man, and he had to quit after four years. He was basically running the company with Michael. He’s like, “We’re fighting. We’re taking on IBM with a thousand dollars of working capital from a shitty office in the industrial part in Austin.” IBM’s the biggest company in the world. I didn’t know this, it was the first company to hit $100 billion market cap. “My back hurts. I’m losing hair, I can’t sleep. I got digestive issues.” Lee’s dead after four years. And he goes, “And Michael’s excited. It’s invigorated him,” and he gave me the line, he goes, “because he built a business that was natural to him. I’m dying and he’s thriving because it’s natural to him and it’s not natural to me.” And I think that’s the key, man. People are like, “Oh, I’m going to imitate X, Y, and Z.” It’s like, no, no, no. You should be copying the how, not the what. You don’t copy what they did, you copy how they did it, and then you just take the little ideas that make sense to you. So you ask, “How am I applying this for my own work?” I am either completely apathetic and ignore something or completely obsessed. It’s zero or 100 and nothing in the middle. So the reason I love Munger, because Munger gave me really — Munger and your friend Naval, had a big role in this too. Gave me the blueprint where he’s just like, “Hey, we found that…” Oftentimes Munger has this line that oftentimes the winning system in business goes ridiculously far, maximizing and/or minimizing one or a few variables. And he used Costco like the example, and then he has another line. “Find a simple idea and take it seriously.” Sharing lessons from biographies of great people is a very, very simple idea. Doing it for nine years, working 70 hours a week at it, building systems for it, redoing it over and over again is not — that’s the serious part. His other quote that I’ve already shared earlier, “There’s ideas worth billions in a $30 history book.” That’s another idea. That’s maybe why the work will be valuable and attract the audience that it could attract, another idea from him. You want to maneuver yourself into an area that you’re intensely interested in, that just being a fanatic, like a Sam Walton or a Jim Sinegal or a Sol Price is just — Jeff Bezos, very helpful. These are fanatics, they’re intensely interested in what they’re doing. That is worth a lot of money, and I’ve become friends with Michael Ovitz, who’s also one of the first guests on my new show. And his whole thing is like, you cannot fight against your job. That’s one of the best pieces of advice. He’s like, “People fight against their job all the time and they lose.” You have to find something that you’re intensely drawn to it. Tim Ferriss: So I have a couple of bullets. You should explain who Michael Ovitz is. Why don’t you do that first, and then I’ll just hop to two questions related to Michael Ovitz specifically. David Senra: Michael Ovitz is a shark. He’s one of the most intense people. I think he’s 80 by now. So Rick and I live very close to each other in Miami, and we always have breakfast at the same spot that I’m not going to say publicly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, good idea. David Senra: And so we’re hanging out — Tim Ferriss: The disinformation campaign. Yeah, it’s always at Denny’s. Moons Over My Hammy. David Senra: So his phone is on the table and it rings and it says “Michael Ovitz” and I gasped. I’m like, “Oh,” I read — everybody knows who Michael — Michael Ovitz was the most powerful man in Hollywood at one time. He had like 75 percent market share, 90 percent market share. He was the most powerful agent. He’s the founder of CAA, which still exists to this day. And I’m like, “Oh, God, I know who that is. I’ve done episodes of this guy.” And so he picks up and they’ve been friends for 20 years, 25 years, something like that. And he goes, “Hey, I’m sitting here with somebody you might know. Have you ever heard of David Senra and the Founders podcast?” And Michael pauses, he goes, “I listened to four of them yesterday.” He was on his boat in St. Barts. Tim Ferriss: That’s incredible. David Senra: No, but this is how — he’s a shark and a killer. He’s on his boat in St. Barts, he’s like studying Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. He’s quoting stuff from the episode and so, we wind up having dinner. Tim Ferriss: Rockefeller, one of the biggest sharks to ever live. David Senra: 100 percent. And so we wound up having dinner, and this is one of the things I asked him, because his whole thing is going to run through — you’re going to meet thousands of people in your life. He’s going to definitely meet way more people than I will, because I’m an introvert. And he used to call 300 people a day, because he was kind of running Hollywood. Ovitz’s advice to me was just like, “You’re going to meet thousands of people in your life, and what I would recommend is just spend all the time with a handful that really matter.” And he’s like, “For me, Rick is one of those people.” And I go, “Why?” And obviously, he’s like, “Well, he’s intelligent,” basically. But he’s like, “Because he tells me the truth.” Tim Ferriss: That is one thing you can definitely reply. That’s one thing you can rely on Rick for. David Senra: But in general — Tim Ferriss: Not sure he can help himself. Not sure it’s a conscious decision. David Senra: No, but in general, his whole point is when you get to be as famous and as well-known, as wealthy as Ovitz, everybody is going to kiss your ass. Everybody wants something from you. They won’t either want to tell you how great you are, or they want money from you, or they want you to sell, buy something. And you’re just like, there’s so few people that you know that truly love you for you and don’t want anything from you. They just want to be friends. And they will tell you the truth. And this is the very dangerous thing that really successful people do. They surround themselves with people that don’t tell them the truth. And this is an idea I got from Jim Casey, the founder of UPS. He realized that there’s this weird capture if you only talk to your top executives, so let’s say you have 10 top executives, and then they distribute everything else to the company. They work themselves in a position where they have the ear of the king and you hear nothing good. So he’s like, “I don’t want to talk to them at all.” He would stop and talk to every single — he’d make his driver stop every single time they see a brown truck. And he would talk to the people doing the actual service. Tim Ferriss: Because he wouldn’t get the bad news or they would — David Senra: They would tell them what actually is going on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: What is actually happening? And the crazy impressive founders that I’ve been able to spend a lot of time with, most of them are 60, 70, 80 years old. Those are my favorite. I love them. They’re not in their office. They’re in their warehouses. They’re on the factory line. They’re in their stores. They’re in constant contact with the customer and the person delivering the service to the customer. Not with their — they’re not looking at a whiteboard with their executives. They’re very practical, non-theoretical people. I think it’s really important. So yeah, I think in my own thing, it’s just like I like to be obsessed and focus on one thing. I don’t like to multitask. So therefore everybody is like every single publisher. It’s like, “Write a book, you should do this.” I’m like, everybody says, “Hey, I like X, so do Y.” And I’m like, “But then if I do Y, I don’t do X.” And so my whole thing is just very simple. I want to do one thing relentlessly. Tim Ferriss: So related to Michael Ovitz, there are a few notes here that I think relate to the new show and the interview you did with him. And I want to ask about two of them. So the first is the benefits of low introspection. And the second — so you can tackle these in either order is “this can’t be my life,” in quotation marks, is a powerful motivator. Can you expand on those?David Senra: So “This can’t be my life” is a very powerful motivator. You see it over and over again. I think the sense of drive, the way you grew up on Long Island, the way I grew up, I was like, “I’m not going out like this.” I don’t care what I have to do — Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to replay this movie. David Senra: No way. I think in many cases, seeing examples of what you don’t want your life to be is more powerful than seeing what you want it to be. I think maybe that one comes first and then, you start to see, “Oh, actually this is the path I want to go down.” Tim Ferriss: There’s an expression in Japanese, which is [foreign language] is like opposite side. [foreign language] is teacher and it’s someone who teaches you by showing you what not to do. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right. David Senra: Yeah. I would say my family definitely the case — Tim Ferriss: One of those. David Senra: Yeah, you just see this over and over again. And so with him, he grew up in the valley. He could see where he wanted to be. He could see the mansions of Beverly Hills. He saw the contrast between, “This is what I’m worried about with social media.” It’s like before we grew up, what do you see? You basically see, “Oh, that’s the nice neighborhood over there. That’s kind of a bad neighborhood.” Now you see the richest people in the world every day and the poorest people in the world, you’re exposed to nothing but extremes, which is like we’ve never — in human history, we’ve never been exposed to that. And what is the long-term effects of that? I have a teenage daughter now, and I think there’s a lot of negativity of this like, you only see the most beautiful people. If you were just in a town where we grew up, you might see a really beautiful woman. You’re not seeing them all day long. It’s just this unfair — Tim Ferriss: Barrage. David Senra: Yeah, barrage of unattainable standards. So with him, he was fiercely driven to succeed. And one of my favorite parts of his book, the guy now, wildly successful, but even before that, he left, I think it was William Morris Agency, he starts CAA, they started to have a little success. He winds up buying a house in Brentwood and it was like $650,000, which is fantastic, but nothing compared to what’s going to happen over the next decades in his life. But he just woke up every morning, he’s like, “I can’t believe I live in Brentwood.” “I can’t believe this. I did this.” And then once you start seeing results, the grind becomes very addictive. And he, if you had, what’s his archetype, grinder. I’m going to throw sheer hours and energy. He’s also an amazing — one of the best salespeople alive, very charismatic. He’s got a lot of superpowers. I actually met Marc Andreessen. I asked him this because Marc Andreessen is on record saying that when he started a16z, they essentially copied CAA. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I think they brought Michael Ovitz in. David Senra: They did. They both talk about this. And I asked him, I go, “What do you think is Michael’s superpower?” He’s like, “He’s the world’s greatest agent and therefore the greatest salesperson, the world’s greatest salesperson.” And so that’s one example from his book is just like, this can’t be my life. I don’t want to be like this. I’m going to direct all my energy and do something different. Now the low introspection thing is I’m not a controversial person. I’m just sharing lessons from history that I read in a book. You don’t have to listen, you don’t have to pay attention, it doesn’t matter. But when I bring up the fact that a lot of these people have low or zero introspection. Meaning that when they find what they want to do in life, they wake up and they know exactly what they’re doing that day. Sam Walton was not waking up saying, “What are my feelings like today? What should I do? Should I think about the meaning of life?” He’s like, “No, I founded Walmart. I made one Walmart. I’m going to make another one and another one and another one. I will make every Walmart better and better and better.” And I think having low introspection after you found your mission in life — and this is a sad thing, I think most people never find their mission. I know I found my mission. I don’t think about what should I do today. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to talk, obviously, about the new show and we’ve been alluding to it and mentioning some of the guests. But before we get there — so you’re about to meet Michael and he had been ostensibly on vacation, but he’s listening to your episodes on Rockefeller and others. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Do you recall any of the other episodes? David Senra: The Vanderbilt one stuck up in my mind. I mean, we text about them. I don’t remember — the Vanderbilt is the one that really — the Rockefeller and the Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt especially because Vanderbilt is like — what I say is I’m kind of telling the same story over and over again. I think it’s more like church than it is like — just like I went to church. I grew up as a fundamentalist Christian. We met together with believers on regular intervals on Wednesday and Sunday. And it’s not like the preacher got up there and was like, “Hey, we talked about that Jesus guy enough, we’re going to move on to somebody else.” It’s like we literally just go to the same book over and over again. And so I always say there’s always a historical equivalent to anybody we’re dealing with today or in the past. But Vanderbilt, to me — there’s not an entrepreneurial historical equivalent. He’s like Putin or something. When he died, he controlled five percent of the money supply. So one out of $25. Tim Ferriss: So I guess the reason I was asking about the episodes, and I don’t know Michael, so this is not a judgment or criticism of Michael at all, but I suppose if you believe that there is a value to low introspection for the purposes of building a business, which I would agree. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is there not a risk, and I have not listened to those particular episodes on Rockefeller and Vanderbilt, but I’ve read a bit of the history. These are not necessarily people you automatically want to model everything in all — David Senra: No, I think Ovitz would. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So this is I suppose my question. Is there a risk of ending up amoral, immoral or sociopathic, if you — one of the things you optimize for is low introspection because — or maybe that’s just hardwiring frankly, and you’re just not inclined to do it. David Senra: That’s a good question. Tim Ferriss: Because this archetype does exist, just like the rape, pillage, destroy archetype is an archetype. David Senra: They’re overrepresented in entrepreneurship. Why? Because, if entrepreneurship [is] done correctly, [it yields] the greatest material rewards in human history. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: So of course, it’s going to be full of psychopaths and sociopaths. Whatever — I don’t know if you know the numbers on this, but they assume five percent of the population’s sociopathic or something like that. Is that something like that? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know the numbers. David Senra: Let’s just make it up. It’s five percent of the general population. It’s probably five times that of entrepreneurs and investors and people like this or anybody — political power. Power in general. This is why I think the work of Robert Caro is so interesting. And I always make the argument that there should only — there should be a law. The only one law that I would foist upon society is that there’s only one person allowed to write a thousand-page biography. I have no problem reading that. Almost none of the books that I’ve read that are a thousand pages needed to be a thousand pages. They just didn’t know what to put in there. Robert Caro is the only one that should be able to write long biographies because everything that he has in there should be in there. I think he’s a master of his craft. He’s the best to ever do it. But he’s saying, “I’m not writing biographies. I’m writing about how humans accumulate and then wield power. And I did it first on a local level in New York with Robert Moses, and now I’m showing what happens on a national level. And guess what, LBJ would sacrifice everything to get what he wanted. Personal ethics, his relationships, everything.” Tim Ferriss: Stealing elections. David Senra: This is the wonderful thing about studying history. History doesn’t repeat, human nature does. So if you just read Will and — and you both love Will and Ariel Durant, right? Read the history of human civilization. Read their hundred-page book, Lessons of History. The same stuff repeats over and over again. So when it comes out and you see this on the news, “Oh, of course no one stole the election.” It’s like stealing every election in all different countries. Stealing the elections is an American pastime. Just read Robert Caro. And it could be a little Senate election in Texas. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. David Senra: If you don’t think — Tim Ferriss: That missing ballot box. David Senra: Yeah. The line I have about this is from Will Durant, where he’s just like, “In every age, humans are dishonest and governments are corrupt.” It’s one of my favorite quotes from Lessons of History, and every age, nothing that we’re doing is new. We’re telling the same stories over and over and over again. You see the same people over and over again. So yeah, I’m sure there’s a ton of people that read these biographies and that listen to my podcast that are absolute psychopaths. I don’t think Ovitz is a psychopath. He’s an extreme winner. He wants to win. Tim Ferriss: The line may be pretty thin. David Senra: Yeah, of course. Of course. Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying he is, by the way, sociopath. It’s just that, just like you were mentioning, you can convince yourself of a bad idea, very compellingly, just as you can a good idea. It’s like when you start to get into the gray waters of morality as winning compounds upon winning, oftentimes the person who cares less about other people wins. If they can discard that consideration. David Senra: 100 percent, and that’s been true in the past. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: True today, will be true.That’s the point, that this is why it’s so interesting. You have to — I look at this as almost — I think something I didn’t even understand is I have the ability to step outside of myself, and I’m kind of like a casual observer of human nature. Tim Ferriss: I want to ask you, and then I’m going to hop to questions about podcasting on the new show, about how you think about assessing leaders, entrepreneurs, reading biographies or autobiographies, and figuring out what people claim as things that help them succeed, to succeed, actually help them versus hindering them. In other words, what are the “because of” versus the “in spite of?” So for instance, if high disagreeability or low agreeability is common across a lot of founders. To what extent is that — can you point to that as one of the causal factors for their success as opposed to just an emergency break they had on, causing all sorts of problems that they managed to overcome, so they succeeded despite. How do you think about separating those two things? David Senra: So one of the things I love about James Dyson, who is a hero of mine, it’s the person that on the planet that I want to meet that I haven’t met. The number one is him. And what I love about him is how stubborn he is, because I see myself in that. And it turns out his stubbornness worked out for him because he had the right idea, but this is where it goes back to like you can’t blindly copy. There’s no formula. There’s no formula, there’s no track. So it’s like he’s stubborn on an idea that was a great idea, it just needed more time. You could be stubborn on an idea that’s terrible and going nowhere. And then you did the exact same thing for the exact same amount of time. And on the other side of that, he has one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world, and you have a miserable life. There’s no answers to that. There’s nobody coming to save you. None of this shit works if you can’t trust your own judgment and figure things out. That’s why when people are like, “Oh, more people should be entrepreneurs.” I don’t know about that. I want to encourage the people that think they can do it, to do it. But I think in many cases, most people should work, like they should choose a different path because it’s very, very risky. Like Todd Graves, the Raising Cane’s guy I told you about, right? His whole thing is entrepreneurs should have higher risk tolerance. James Dyson, multiple times, risked every single possession he had to chase his dream. He signed over his house multiple times. If he failed, they could have been homeless. It worked out for him. Todd Graves had this crazy way to finance the first 28 Raising Cane’s where essentially he goes to an angel investor, he goes to Tim Ferriss and says, “Hey, you’re going to give me a 200,000 loan, okay? It’s going to be subjugated loan to the bank. I’m going to guarantee you a 15 percent return on the $200,000 for X amount of time.” You say, “Oh, that sounds great. You’re paying me 15 percent on my 200 grand.” But you don’t get any equity. I take that 200,000 equity that I have from this document from Tim. I go to a bank and say, “This is as collateral. Loan me the other 600 grand or whatever the number is to get this up and running.” And he did that for 28 times and he’s like, “Oh, I’m rolling, rolling, rolling.” Leveraged up to his eyeballs. What’s the problem? “I open up. Every time I open a new Raising Cane’s, there’s a line out the door from day one.” Well, then a little thing called Hurricane Katrina comes and guess where? 28 of his restaurants are all in Louisiana, and he almost died, and he says, “If I didn’t come out of that, there would be no story. It’d be gone.” And then I guess the second part of — I don’t know why this popped into my mind, but when you’re reading history, we’re reading about stories that happened a hundred years ago, 200 years ago, 50 years ago. Some of them are from that person’s own mouth. Like, imagine if you tell your own life story, you’re going to, here’s the good part. You’re going to hide the bad. You’re human, right? And so people are like, “Well, how do you know if what you’re reading is true?” The line is like if you think the news is fake, wait till you read history. Tim Ferriss: It’s just old news. David Senra: I don’t know. My idea is we’re not taking a test at the end of this. I’m not saying did this actually happen in 1912. It’s like, is the idea behind what he’s doing a good idea for me? And so the example of Rockefeller that you see that Elon used, where Rockefeller tells the story, I don’t know if it actually happened, but he tells the story where they would have to solder closed the barrels that they transport oil in, and he goes up one day and he says, “How many drops of solder do you use?” He’s like, “I use 40.” He’s like, “Have you ever tried 38?” He’s like, “No, we never tried 38.” “Can you try 38?” They tried 38, it leaks. “Okay, try 39.” They tried 39, doesn’t leak. That one drop of solder at the time of the business saved him $2,500 a year, the business grows and compounds for the next three decades, and now he’s saving like hundreds of thousands from that then. Did that actually happen? I don’t know. But that’s a good idea to find the limit, to actually, “Hey, maybe I should control my costs a little more. Maybe I need to actually see if I can do this in a more efficient way.” I don’t know if it happened. I just want the idea behind it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, just to reiterate what you’re saying, it’s tough to separate the fact from fiction, right? And then sometimes this is actually why I just read fiction because I’m like, “There still are truths to extract,” right? There are principles that you can extract from, this is now cliched because it’s been made into a popular movie, but Dune or Stranger in a Strange Land. You can actually pull a lot from just straight-up fiction. And then when it comes to the business side, because I’ve read so many, not as many as you, but tons of business books, still have my early copies and my notes from those books with Losing my Virginity, Richard Branson, early Yvon Chouinard, I think it’s Let My People Go Surfing, et cetera, still have all those books, and when you look at — part of the reason also that I like early biographies, so let’s just say like Hard Drive first on Bill Gates versus a later, I don’t want to say sanitized, but let’s say sanitized version where — David Senra: I’m going through this right now, where it’s like, look — Tim Ferriss: Warren Buffett, love the guy, and he’s turned himself into the “Awww, shucks” grandpa neighbor who takes his garbage out in a robe. David Senra: Killer. Killer. Tim Ferriss: He’s a killer, and I remember reading, I think it was The Making of an American Capitalist way back in the day, and the story that stuck out, and I hope I’m not inventing this, I don’t see why I would, but his routine was to go home, walk upstairs, and read. David Senra: Step over his children. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Was it his son — David Senra: Yes. Step over — Tim Ferriss: — who had fallen down the stairs, is sprawled out like a chalk outline at a crime scene, steps over his injured son to go upstairs to do more reading of S1 filings or whatever he was doing. David Senra: You bring up something interesting. This is why I don’t believe them when they say they have regrets at the end of their life. So if I read Making of an American Capitalist, an excellent book. I think that’s actually the best biography. Tim Ferriss: It’s so good. David Senra: You read Snowball after his wife leaves him and he says, “The biggest mistake, if I could go back and live life again, the biggest mistake I would do is I would change whatever I need, so” — I think her name was Susie — “didn’t leave me.” No, I don’t believe you. Tim Ferriss: I don’t buy it. David Senra: No, none of them. When they all say — like a Leonardo Del Vecchio, the guy that started Luxottica. I think I had it translated from Italian. Some of these biographies are in different languages so, again, go back to differentiation, what can I do that no one else is doing, we’ve translated the Red Bull book from German. Tim Ferriss: It was awesome. I listened to that. David Senra: I appreciate that.But he gets to the end of his life, he is an orphan. Dad dies young — Tim Ferriss: What was the company again? David Senra: Luxottica. So they essentially — Tim Ferriss: [inaudible]. David Senra: Monopolize glasses, everything. So Mark Zuckerberg just invested, I think, three and a half billion dollars for like three percent of the company. Tim Ferriss: Wow. David Senra: And so for essentially 60 years, he just a slow, methodical Rockefeller-esque march through the entire industry until he controls every single component of eyeglasses, sunglasses, everything. It’s like completely dominant. He gets to the end of his life, he’s just like, “Oh, yeah. The one regret I have is…” He’s married multiple times. I think there’s like a 50-year gap between his oldest son and his youngest son. So it’s like he’s like a wild boy, but he’s like, “The one regret I have is I didn’t spend more time with my kids.” No, you wouldn’t change a thing. Tim Ferriss: It’s not true. David Senra: It’s not true because I don’t think they could. That’s what where you just said. It’s like maybe they didn’t have a choice. Maybe it’s just hardwired. And so I’m going through that literally right now because this week I read Source Code which is Bill Gates’ autobiography about the first 20 years of his life, his version. I reread Hard Drive, Overdrive, which is also written by the same guys that wrote Hard Drive, and then I pulled all my highlights and notes for Paul Allen’s description of Bill Gates in Paul Allen’s autobiography. There is a vast difference between what’s in Source Code and what is in Hard Drive, and it’s obviously Hard Drive is more accurate. It’s written right after it happened. Bill is not the 70-year-old man he is now, and he’s in a different world, but watch his interviews, watch the documentary on Netflix about him. He’s like, “I was hardcore. That was my advantage.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. David Senra: He was. Tim Ferriss: Killer. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And also these questions, a lot of the questions that I ask myself when I’m reading any nonfiction — I shouldn’t say any nonfiction, let’s say biographies where I’m hoping to model something. One is like is, or an autobiography, okay, what’s the bias here. Are there any particular biases I should be aware of, okay? Is anyone in like reputation rehab mode before they die? Okay, let’s keep that. David Senra: Sure. Tim Ferriss: What type of survivorship bias might there be, right? Who tried the same? Do we have 99 out of 100 who tried something similar and failed? Let’s take a look at the tape. Okay. Luck is luck. Luck’s everywhere, right? So the fact that Bill Gates ended up with a computer, winding it up with the computers, it’s just like it’s, yeah. David Senra: Timing. I think timing. Tim Ferriss: Timing is a huge piece. By the way, these are not all reasons to discount anything, but I just want to mention a couple of that I try to think of. The other I try to think of, because I might try to mimic someone in sports if I’m trying to learn something, or language learning or whatever it might be, is what are attributes, what is trainable and what is not trainable, right? Because I’ve heard these stories from people who know Bill Gates and they’re like, “Well, we were going to go on this short vacation in…” fill in the blank, I can’t remember, Costa Rica, right? They’re going to go on a birding trip in the morning. It’s just like a two, three-hour thing with a world-class birding guide. They do the trip, and the night before, Bill has stayed up and read five books on birding, memorized them seemingly without trying, and is basically having like a peer-to-peer discussion with the birding expert as they’re going through the rainforest. That’s not normal. David Senra: No. It’s not. Tim Ferriss: That’s like “I’m going to do calf raises to make my body look like Michael Phelps.” No, you’re not. That’s not going to work. So it’s like when I’m looking for people to model, I’m trying to find people who have hopefully a comparable composition of strengths that I can amplify in myself or that are coachable, right? And so the question after all that is, does anyone stand out to you, of the biographies or people you’ve met, where you’re like in terms of someone doing the most with the hand they’ve been dealt — so maybe they’re not a freak of nature. David Senra: So not aliens. Tim Ferriss: They’re not a freak of nature, necessarily, because there are freaks of nature among the people that you study, the people I study, but it’s like, all right, these people might have a few strengths, but they’re not complete freaks. They’re not the Usain Bolts of — fill in the blank, and man, oh, man, did they play their hand well. They’re just so good at playing the hands that they are dealt, that person. Does anybody stick out? David Senra: Sam Walton. Tim Ferriss: All right. David Senra: Sam Walton’s one of my favorite entrepreneurs. If you really think about it, so he had this crazy thing, this crazy idea. I don’t think he obviously didn’t know what Walmart was going to turn into, but one of the ways they avoided all the inheritance tax is if you give away the equity before it’s valuable. The last time I checked, if you look at all of the Walmart equity owned by the family, that means the wealth that came from his idea, it would be like 432 billion today if it was consolidated in one person, right? When you study Sam, he’s obviously smart, but he was just like, he didn’t really know what he was going to do. Then he had this idea, he’s like, “Well, maybe I can be good at retailing.” And then he starts out in Newport, Arkansas with one store. This is what drives me insane about the modern day entrepreneurship industry is how everybody, they start out with like weird goals, like “I’m going to build a trillion-dollar company,” or “I’m going to be the fastest person to a hundred million ARR,” and you’re just like, “Okay, but none of these people talk like that. You’re doing it for the wrong reason, so you probably won’t get there if that’s just the case.” It’s like what Jerry Seinfeld says, “If you’re just doing it for money, you only get so far.” With him, he was just fascinated by stores and trying to make it a little bit better every day, and he spends — Tim Ferriss: It was on vacation, right? Didn’t matter where he was, he would go into a retail store — David Senra: His kids told the story. It’s just like vacation was essentially driving to different towns and checking out different retailers. The most important thing about his story, one of the most important things, is this idea to go slow now so you can go faster later. And so you’re like, “Okay.” The beginning of his career, he’s in one tiny store. I think they start doing 25,000 a year. 25,000 a year in revenue, and I think he gets up to like 250 grand. It took him five years. But for five years he just had one story. It was like experimenting, understanding, trying to figure out what the different parts of retail are because there’s no such thing as discounting and wholesaling and all this other stuff that he was doing that he’s going to do later on. And then what’s fascinating is later in his career after Walmart, he then takes that idea, he goes and visits Sol Price, who we mentioned earlier, he takes that idea. He’s like, “Oh, this is a great idea. I’m going to do this.” He does Sam’s Club. In that same five-year period, so you have the first five years, one store, separated by maybe 40 years in the career, that second five years when he’s starting something else, in that five-year period he doesn’t have one store. He winds up doing, I think, a hundred stores and like seven billion in revenue from this new category because you see him learning. And so, yes, I think he was brilliant, but he’s not memorizing five books overnight in doing that. This is like mine, I don’t think — man, one of the reasons that I do what I do is because Munger became a hero and he talks over and over again about being a biography nut, that he read more biographies than anybody else. I got to spend three hours inside of his house talking to him right before he died. I don’t care how many biographies I read, how many books I read for the rest of my life, I cannot have a brain like him. I will never have a brain like him. Anybody at 99 is going to have some level of cognitive decline. You know what one of my first thoughts was about an hour and a half into the conversation with him was, “This guy had to be terrifying when he was 60.” Terrifying. Terrifying. Think about this. Everybody that I know, when I get to meet fancy people I always ask them, “Who’s the smartest person you know? What’s the best business you know?” It can’t be like Apple. It’s like these interesting, weird things, and every single person that says — if they know Buffett and they don’t tell you it’s Buffett, they’re wrong. Buffett chose this guy to let him mold and shape his thinking. What does that tell you about his intelligence? I remember — because this is what I do, again, I’m like laying bricks every day. I don’t think I’m a brilliant person. I just show up every day and don’t quit. And so I read. Once I find Munger, I read, literally, not, oh, I read some of the books, I read every single book on Munger. Then I reread my highlights over and over again. So my days, I wake up, work out, read for a few hours, have lunch, then reread past highlights in the afternoon. All my social media posts are just me rereading highlights. I read every single book on Munger, then I reread all the highlights, but then I read all the books he tells me to read, because he’ll tell you, “Read Les Schwab.” He’ll tell you all these things. He’ll tell you Henry Kaiser. I was like, “Who the hell is Henry Kaiser?” Henry Kaiser started a hundred companies. He built the Hoover Dam. He built Liberty ships. I go, “What?” Tim Ferriss: By the way, just the fact that pretty much everyone listening to this podcast will have no idea of who that person is just underscores, I think, how ridiculous it is to get overly fixated on legacy as an excuse for all sorts of behaviors. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Nobody’s going to remember you. David Senra: No. I’m anti-legacy and I’m anti-family dynasty. I think bequeathing your kids a bunch of wealth is — well, that’s another story for another day. Tim Ferriss: But okay, a hundred companies. Right. Hoover Dam, which, by the way, was made in, what, like eight years or 12 years. I mean, some insane time span. David Senra: Crazy. So first of all, I’m freaked out. I’m there, it’s me, two other young entrepreneurs in their 30s, and they had both met Charlie before. And then I’m like 10 minutes in and I’m just like, “Ugh.” I just couldn’t believe what’s happening to me. I’m like, “That’s fucking Charlie Munger over there.” And then you know he’s looking at you, because he’s blind, and so if he’s looking at you like this, he’s not looking at you. He’s got to go like this and this because then he’s got to look through his glasses. So you know when he’s looking at you. And then my friend looks at me, he’s like, “Get in here. Do something.” I literally sat there. Me not speaking for 10 minutes, it’s really hard for me to do. There’s a reason I do monologue podcasts. So then I see we’re in his library, so then I’m like, “Oh, this is my savior,” because I’ve read all those books behind him because he told me to read them. And so this is why I said it doesn’t matter what I do, and this will answer your question a long way. I start asking questions about Henry Kaiser and all these books, and he knows the revenue, he knows the partner, he knows how the business ended, he knows the mistakes they made. And then I go, “Charlie, when’s the last time you read these books?” And he’s like, “15 years ago.” And then I go, when we’re shifting from the library to dinner, I was like, “Charlie, can I go through your library?” He’s like, “Of course.” He’s just sitting in his chair and I’m going through the books and I open them. No notes. Tim Ferriss: Different stock. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, different stock. Oh, my God. So, all right, we are going to get to the things I promised, but I have to ask you. So in addition to smartest person, best business, what are some of your other go-to questions when you meet the fancy folks? David Senra: So who’s the smartest person you know? What’s the best business you know? I actually got to spend some time with Eddie Lampert. So Eddie Lampert at one time was thought to be the next Buffett, and he was mentored by Richard Rainwater, and I find Richard Rainwater really fascinating because Richard Rainwater has probably — Tim Ferriss: Great man too. David Senra: Oh, excellent. Richard, first of all there’s no biographies on him. He died rather young. He probably created more billionaire investors in America than any other person in direct mentorship. Eddie broke the record, I think in like the ’80s or’ 90s for the most taxable income made by an American, and he was super young. And so Eddie lives in Miami and I was at his house. Tim Ferriss: He was like, “Never again. I’m moving to Miami.” David Senra: No, no. No, no. So that might be one of the best investments because he probably paid $12 million for his house and his house will probably sell for 150 million today because it’s on the island that Bezos lives on, and the house is beautiful. Tim Ferriss: I’m sure he won’t even notice it on his balance sheet or in his life. David Senra: He’s much more out of the spotlight now. But again, he’s one of these older guys, just very, very wise and very quiet. He’s like me. He’s introverted. You go to his house, there’s just books everywhere. He’s got this insane yacht that I went on called the Fountainhead. I’ll let people google it. It is insane. Tim Ferriss: I mean, great name too. David Senra: Yeah, but same thing. You go on the boat and you go on the boat, dude, and it’s full of books. It’s the weirdest — Tim Ferriss: Ran out of room at his house, so had to buy a super yacht for the books. David Senra: It’s the weirdest unintended hack ever to build a world-class network of just read a bunch of history and they’ll come get you. They’re like — I’ve never sent a cold DM in my life, ever. I’ve never sent a cold email in my life. Tim Ferriss: All, right. So what do you have? Why did Lampert come? You’re asking him questions. David Senra: I’m asking these questions, right? Basically, and they’re not mean to me. He’s like, “Yeah, but there’s better questions you can ask.” I was like, “Okay, tell me what they are.” And so his answers are, like the smartest person, he’s like, “Well, I spent a bunch of time with Buffett.” I go, “Okay.” He goes, “It’s obviously Buffett.” He goes, “There’s actually more interesting…” And then who’s the best investor, that was another question I asked. He goes, “There’s actually a more interesting question that you’re not asking.” I go, “What’s that?” He goes, “Who’s the best dealmaker?” Tim Ferriss: Mm. Mm-hmm. That’s a great one. David Senra: And I go, “I don’t know what that means.” I don’t know anything about investing. The question I’ve asked Rick and Patrick, they probably think I’m retarded. You can edit that question out, edit that word out. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s fine. David Senra: But they’re just like, “What is wrong with this guy?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. We didn’t even get to — I mean, I would say Brad Jacobs would fit in sort of the dealmaker. Or Zell. David Senra: Yeah. But yeah, but his is like a different — so, okay, this is very fascinating what Eddie said. So again, Eddie, you can go back and read profiles of him. He was like a boy wonderkid. Rick told me a funny story. They used to all be at the same golf club in New Jersey, and Richard Rainwater walked in, and Rick’s like a young kid and Rainwater’s a legend, and he’s making conversation with him. He goes, “We just wait, the best investor in the America’s going to walk through that door.” And Rick goes, “Buffett?” And it was Eddie. So anyways, Eddie’s like, “There’s a better question that you’re not asking.” I was like, “All right. Well, you’re way smarter than I am, tell me.” He goes, “Who’s the best dealmaker?” I don’t know what that means. He goes, “Well, an investor is judged on ROIC, return on invested capital.” He goes, “The two best dealmakers I ever knew were Richard Rainwater and David Geffen.” So the thing about David Geffen, he’s super underrated. He’s another person I’d like to spend time with if I could, is it’s one thing to have a bunch of money. It’s another thing to have a bunch of money and be liquid. There is a line in this profile on Larry Gagosian that I read that says, “Any time there’s a downturn…” Larry Gagosian’s maybe the most successful art dealer in the world. Art soars during great economic times and kind of doesn’t do so well in other times. Any time there was a dip and they needed to make money, they’d call David because they said David is as liquid as the day is long. David gave a 26-year-old Eddie Lampert like 200 million of his own money to run. So David’s just like liquid. Tim Ferriss: Staked him. David Senra: And so he goes, “David is a crazy dealmaker.” He goes — Tim Ferriss: I guess he didn’t stake him. He was an LP. David Senra: I don’t think it was a fund structure. I think it was, “Here’s 200, make it bigger.” Tim Ferriss: Make it bigger. David Senra: I don’t think he’s going to be like, “You make money if I make money.” I don’t think it was a permanent structure, which is interesting. Sam Zell never had a permanent structure. There’s actually a lot of them. I find those more interesting. But anyways, I was like, “Okay, so why is Richard Rainwater one of the best dealmakers?” He’s like, “Because with Richard it was all returns, no capital.” I was like, “What?” He goes, “Richard maneuvered himself into such an influential position in the American economy because of who he knew, and him being involved in your deal immediately made it more valuable that people just gave him the equity.” All returns, no capital. That was like one of my favorite ideas that I’ve ever heard. Yeah, and he would just tell amazing stories. He told me a story where Richard, when he mentors you — like, he recruited Eddie. Eddie was living in New York, working at Goldman Sachs, if I remember correctly. He convinced him to move to Fort Worth, Texas. Have you ever been to Fort Worth? Tim Ferriss: I have. David Senra: Okay. I’ve been there too. There’s nothing there, and in the ’80s there was less than nothing there. This kid moves there, they would travel together, and Eddie said that Richard would want to summer somewhere in Massachusetts, and it was like this 20-room hotel that was members only, so it’s not open to the random public, and he insisted that Eddie be put in the room next to him. One day, a bunch of guys knock on Eddie’s door while he’s in the room supposed to be working and researching, and they come in with a bunch of tools. He’s like, “What are you doing?” He’s like, “Richard wants us to put a hole in this wall.” Richard didn’t want to go in the hallway and walk around to Eddie’s room. So he made them knock a hole and then install a door so he could just go. He could have direct access to Eddie just with a door that didn’t exist. Tim Ferriss: That’s incredible. David Senra: He just had all kinds of crazy stories. Tim Ferriss: All right, so not Buffett, not Munger, smartest person. David Senra: That I met? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, smartest person. Let’s revise that and just say if you could pick one person you’ve met to be your coach/Yoda. David Senra: Oh, Daniel Ek. Tim Ferriss: Daniel Ek. David Senra: Easily. Tim Ferriss: All right. That was fast. Okay. David Senra: Well, again, Brad Jacobs gives me great advice. Michael Dell would give me great advice, like Todd Graves, but this guy is around my age. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. David Senra: It’s like the gap between us is so obvious when you solve for that, and again, I just think of the stuff he does, his clarity of thought. I greatly admire the product. I like products. I guess we should back up what is actually important to you. I don’t actually give a shit how much money you have. I know a lot of people, and I love these, we’re in New York right now, some of my favorite people. I like the PE guys way more than I like the VC guys because they’re just more honest. The PE guys are like, they have great lines about this, they go, “VC gets all the attention, PE gets all the money.” And then they’re like, “The VCs are lying because they say the founders are the customers. No, the LPs are our customers. The founders didn’t give you any money.” Then the PE guys are just honest. Why do you wake up every day? To maximize the value of my LP dollars. I don’t want to play that game. I don’t want to play it at all, but I respect — their honesty is refreshing. Their scoreboard is, “I have $6 billion and I’ll be better if I have eight.” I am obsessed with product. The fact that I work on my podcast for seven days a week, the fact that I hand-edit the transcript, the fact that I do — like MrBeast drives me — he’s like, “You’re stupid. Somebody can edit. Basically you need an editor. You need all these other things.” I just am obsessed. It’s like you don’t work all your life to do what you love to not do it. I don’t want to outsource stuff. I like the craft of making the product. I’m very proud — like when Spotify Wrapped, some people might, because it’s embarrassing. When my Spotify Wrapped comes out this year, the number one podcast on that is going to be my own. I go back and listen to it. One, I think of it as a tool, right? I was on a treadmill in Malibu a few weeks ago listening to episode 221, which I think is the biography of Charlie Munger. I say to Charlie Munger all the time, “We forget how much we forget.” I listened to this hour-long podcast, like, oh, God, he’s got a lot of great ideas that I forgot. I’m not doing it because I like to hear the sound of my own voice. I also do it because do you think Kobe watched game tape? How am I going to get better if I don’t — when I interviewed Michael Dell, really more of a conversation than an interview, but I listened to the Michael Dell episode that I just did a few months ago, and all I hear is the flaws. All I hear is like, “You stupid idiot. You should use three sentences, that could have been one sentence. That is not even interesting. Cut that next time.” That’s how I get better. I go back and listen to it. So I am obsessed with product. The people that I admire the most are great products. It could be Jiro’s sushi. It could be the Spotify app. It could be, it doesn’t matter, shoes that I like. I just love when people take what they do very seriously and I like the craft of it. And I want to dedicate my life to making a product that makes somebody else’s life better. That is what drives me. I understand, and I have a bunch of friends that like the money or building the systems, if you want to go back to archetypes or just having a big empire. I don’t have any employees. You have three. I guess I have two technical subcontractors doing clips for me and thumbnails and stuff like that. But yeah, I don’t have any desire for a giant empire. I’m a little craftsman in my local shed over here. Tim Ferriss: So why do the new podcast, David Senra? David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Why do it? And we can use any number of different entry points here. So number one, why do it? But you don’t have to answer that as number one. I’m also curious where you see the podcast ecosystem. Is it early? Is it late? Is it oversaturated? Is it undersaturated, et cetera? And then how do you diversify an interview-based podcast? David Senra: Okay. So let’s take number one, the why do it. I was resistant on doing it for years because I like to do one thing and I don’t like to not focus. A huge thing, that if you could summarize nine years, 400 biographies into one word of what I’ve learned, is focus. These people, whether they’re psychos, nice people, different industries, they’re remarkably focused. They’re a different species than the current level of lack of attention spans that we have now that I think are getting worse. So focus is especially important. If you look at how I spend my time though, we just talked about the importance of building a business that’s natural to you. Half my waking time, I would like to be completely alone, not in even the house with somebody else. Alone in my reading, thinking. I like solitude a lot to a scary degree. So that makes sense. Founders, reading books all day, that’s what you do. That makes perfect sense. When I’m not doing that though, if you look at what else I’m doing, essentially do this data dump where I’m in silence half the day and then I go out every night that I’m not with my family. I usually have dinner with another founder, usually that I met through the podcast, and we talk for two, three — some people are like, “Oh, really impressed.” People will send me, “I would love to talk to you.” And they send me a calendar for 30 minutes. I go, “I don’t do 30. We’re not even going to start. We haven’t even started. If that’s what you think this is, I don’t care that you’re a billionaire, we’re just never going to meet, ever.” And it’s always super long from the very first time. I can mention all these people, we talked for a long time. So I’m doing this, anyways. And for years, people like Patrick were like, “You stupid idiot. You should be recording these. This is crazy.” And so there’s two things, to answer your question, that happened. One is, the first time me and Patrick grabbed dinner in New York with Daniel Ek, okay? We talked for four hours. And we get in the car because we’re leaving the city and going back to Patrick’s house because I’m going to spend the night there before I go back home. And the first thing Patrick says, and again, this is why it’s important. The piece of advice that Charlie Munger gave us when we were at his house, he’s like, “Your job at your age is to build a seamless web of deserved trust with other people who are like you.” He’s like, “Everybody knows that me and Buffett — I met Buffett when I was 35. He was 28. What they didn’t understand, there’s a bunch of other guys around our age that we built the same level of trust with and we did life with and did deals with forever. Most of them were dead by the time I met Charlie. And so relationships are very important.” And Munger has that line, “Trust is one of the greatest economic factors in the world,” which I’ve never heard anybody else say that. That’s a truly unique idea. Tim Ferriss: I agree with that. David Senra: And so there’s a level of trust that I am very standoffish. People call me a turtle, I get my shell. And so once you’ve penetrated that, I have a level of trust that you want what’s right for me. There’s no weird competitive vibes here, we’re not secret adversaries. I want to see you win. And then we get in the car and he’s just like, “Goddammit, you need to record these.” And he’s like, “I’ve known Daniel for four years. You got more out of him in four hours than I did in four years.” He’s like, “I spoke two percent of the time. You spoke 49 percent. He spoke the other 49 percent.” And he’s just like, “There’s nobody that could speak to the soul of the founder in the world that you can.” And it’s because he says something and it’s not what he’s saying. It’s what Henry Ford did here and Henry Kaiser did there and Jim Casey did over here, and that’s how my brain naturally works. So I was like, “Okay, that was interesting.” And then part of the conversation was Daniel saying to take — I wasn’t doing video. I have 375 episodes because I’m not doing it for fame. I’m introverted. And Daniel’s just saying in a very nice way, “What are you doing? Stop riding the fence. This is the game that you chose.” And I have the data. Video obviously is important in podcasts. You’re lying to yourself again. The importance of somebody telling the truth. I want people around me to check me. I don’t want sycophants. And I’ll tell you the second person that influenced me that calls me and checks me all the time. And so that got in my mind for a while and I was like, “Okay, that’s interesting.” And I get sad when I don’t podcast. I would like to podcast every day and I can’t because I have to read an entire book before I sit down to make an episode. I cannot make more than 52 episodes a year. I just can’t. I can’t read — people are like, “You must read fast.” No, I read slow, 25 pages an hour at most. And I have to do all the other shit I just told you I had to do, highlighting. You know how long this takes? Tim Ferriss: Taking photographs, putting it into Readwise. David Senra: Yeah. And so then something else that’s important to me is I’m not a political person at all. I don’t even read the news. I will find out the important stuff. If there’s a pandemic, I’ll hear about it. If there’s a war, I’ll hear about it. Other stuff, no idea what’s going on. I have no idea what’s going on. I’m purposely aloof. But one thing that I am passionate about is that entrepreneurship is good for the world as long as you’re spending your time building. You mentioned Losing Your Virginity by Richard Branson. He has the best description I’ve ever heard of a business. “All a business is, is an idea that makes somebody else’s life better.” And therefore, there’s always opportunity because there’s infinite ways to make other people’s lives better. And so that’s what I’m trying to do. And so another person who I’ve become close with is Jared Kushner. We live in Miami together. And we went and met for dinner, and Jared’s a really smart and buttoned-up guy. And again, I don’t pay attention to politics. So the way I met him is actually he reached out to Rick and is like, “I’m a huge Founders fan. Can you contact, see if David would speak at my company offsite?” A lot of companies ask me to speak at their company offsite. And I didn’t know anything about Jared. All I know is that people on the internet like to argue about them because of the Trump stuff, but I judge people on how they are with me. This ever happened to you where you were like, “That person’s great,” and you deal with them, like, “Oh, that guy’s terrible,” or vice versa? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve had both. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. So I’m going to go into this, I’m not going to do the research. I have no idea about all this stuff. I’m just going to see how this is going to go. And then we hit it off right away, and he tried to pay me. I was like, “No, no, no. It’s in Miami. I can drive over there. I can talk about this shit all the time. I like talking about this.” And then we just built a relationship and a friendship from that. We have similar interests. And so we meet for dinner one day. Basically, he went and spoke at this conference in Miami, and he thought he was going to go talk about his new fund, and he thought he was friends with the guy, and the guy’s selling tickets and making money off his name being there. And it’s not like you’re paying speakers. And the guy, essentially, ambushed him and starts asking questions like, “How can you do business with Saudi Arabia? They chopped up Khashoggi,” and all this other stuff. And then before the talk was even done, his social media team was clipping it and sending it out in press releases and stuff. Tim Ferriss: What a mess. David Senra: So I show up at this dinner, and Jared’s always buttoned up and always got his shit together and he’s just like, “What the hell is going on here?” And by the time the dinner ends, it’s everywhere. And again, I’m like, “This is weird that the business and tech press in America, they hate business and tech. They cover things.” I’m an enthusiast. I’m not a journalist, I’m not a critic. I read books all the time where I hate the person or something. You’ll never see me do a podcast about it. I want to talk about stuff I like, not things I hate. It’s a weird thing to go through. Imagine waking up every day, and your job is to cover people that you secretly wish you were. There’s just weird stuff around this. So we had this idea at dinner. I was like, “There should be a place where…” I am not talking about sycophant. I’m saying Todd Graves, people make fun of him because he says that God made him good at chicken fingers and that he’s living a chicken finger dream he thinks is a mission. But I’ll tell you what, he believes it. He’s been offered billions. He owns over 90 percent of the company. He will never sell that company. He’s not doing it for money. He’s doing it because he wants to make money and he does a lot of great things in the community. And I think people should know this guy exists and his ideas should be spread. That’s a good for the world. So those two things happened, and I’m like, “Oh, this is interesting.” I have this weird base of knowledge. So the way Jared describes it is, he’s like, “Talking to you is like talking to 50 of history’s greatest entrepreneurs at the same time.” Because we’ll talk about something and same thing you see I do. And then Daniel’s way of saying that, he’s like, “You’re like an LLM trained on history’s greatest entrepreneurs with the temperature turned up because you’re crazy. So it makes it entertaining.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I think that’s no small contributor to why you have a die-hard fan base. It’s the pulpit preacher fervor that you bring to it. David Senra: But I didn’t understand that until I thought about my childhood. When people say they go to church, that’s not the kind of churches I went to. This really gets me sad and where I was almost crying earlier. My mom deserved a better life. She didn’t deserve to grow up with the monster of her father and frankly, the bitch that her mom was. The one thing that I remember about my mom’s mom that she said to me was that I was a faggot. That is literally the only memory I have is her — she was mentally ill. You’d go to her house, you know National Enquirer and all those things? There’s National Enquirer, there’s The Sun, and all this other stuff that you get when you go to the grocery store. First of all, she was a hoarder, so you’d go in the bathroom and there’s stacks all the way up to the — she wouldn’t throw them out. But she read them like we read The Wall Street Journal. You assume the stock is what they said the stock price is. She’d read it like, “This is true. Bigfoot is true.” I was a kid. This is the memory. I was the age when President Clinton was in the White House and she was convinced that Clinton was gay and his wife was lesbian. And so she saw conspiracy everywhere, and she would direct that at her grandchildren, which is monstrous. And so my mom deserved better. And then the problem was, my mom didn’t have an education and she was a very naive person. And so she turned to the church, but the church she turned to was — do you know who Benny Hinn is? Tim Ferriss: I do know the name. Yeah. David Senra: Okay. So you come up there and he blows on you and you don’t have leprosy anymore, or he hit you in the face, does this thing, and you can walk now. And all this stuff was acting. They caught these people over and over again. And I remember my mom didn’t have a bunch of money and her putting a couple crumpled-up dollars and giving it to them because she thought this is what she’s going to get in her life. It’s sickening to me now that that happened to her and that she fell prey to that and that these people did this and they have private jets and they have all this crazy — I’m sure there’s some people that do that and they believe it. That’s a different thing if they really believe it. I know that guy didn’t believe. Come on, you didn’t believe that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it was a racket. David Senra: But then I didn’t understand that, oh, my God, that influenced the way I make my podcast because it is like — preacher. I feel I shouldn’t be sitting at a desk. I should be sitting at a pulpit. Somebody bought the domain churchforfounders.com, and it points to my podcast. Tim Ferriss: That’s amazing. David Senra: So that’s why I’m doing it. And then the other thing was I just like podcasting and I can have a conversation every day. So we’re going to start out every other week, and then move up to every week, and then I want to be having multiple conversations a week. That’s what I want to do because I’m doing it anyways. Let’s just put a microphone there. And it’s not an interview. Yeah, there’s some questions I have for them, but it’s like a conversation. The idea that I’m going to do a business show interview and compete with Patrick, I think he’s the best interviewer by far. He’s so concise and perfect and he’s just really good at it. And I like to talk. I want to talk 49 percent of the time. Tim Ferriss: How will you balance the two shows? Because it seems like Founders podcast takes a lot as it is. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: One of the benefits of that format is — now, this might put a cap on growth to some extent, but if you’re not playing the video game, it removes a lot of complexity. You don’t necessarily need to travel. You just read. You enjoy your solitude. You do some long-form audio, you can have notes in front of you. You can be picking your nose as you take a deep breath. There’s a lot of flexibility there. How are you going to balance the two without sacrificing Founders, snuffing out the magic X when you’re working on Y? David Senra: This goes back. That’s a great question and it’s something I was very concerned with, and that’s why I said no for so many years. And so then you think if you said yes, then how would you do it instead of just blankly saying no? And there’s a secret of dealing with me that everybody that knows me for a long time realizes, anybody that’s been around me for a long time, and essentially it’s like water on a rock. This is literally going to happen multiple times. So let’s say Patrick or Sam Hinkie would be like, “I have this idea.” And immediately, I’m like, “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard.” And I’ll be really aggressive and angry. It’s like, “Stupid idea, terrible idea.” Then they mention it two weeks later, and now it’s just, “Dumb idea.” Mention it again a few weeks later, silence. Then a few weeks later, I’m like, “Hey guys, I have a great idea.” Tim Ferriss: It’s their idea. David Senra: It’s their idea. Tim Ferriss: A slow-bake. David Senra: They know. They’re just like, “Okay.” It’s just water on a rock. I’ll get to them, it’s just going to take a while. And the problem is now I’ve said that, they know that, and then you have other people that have to deal with me. I’m very difficult to deal with, obviously. You are too. And I think that’s one thing we can bond over. And you’re not trying to be mean, it’s just part of our personalities. And so the answer to your question is Founders is a one person — so I read, I research, I record, I set my own mics, I do all the editing, I hand do the transcripts, I do everything. The only thing outsourced is that I think the clip guy I have is a little genius, a young kid living in Paris. His name’s Maxim, he’s incredible. And then I have somebody now because I have to play the YouTube game, which I hate, and I refuse to do the YouTube thing. I hate it. Tim Ferriss: I haven’t. David Senra: Exactly, I won’t. Tim Ferriss: I’ve cauterized myself in that. David Senra: I won’t do that kind of shit. I’d rather not get views. I have to see something and say I would click on that myself. I’m not doing things for numbers. I didn’t even know how many people were listening to Founders until the first six years. I never looked. And then I started doing these big sponsorship deals and they’re like, “Oh, I should look.” And they’re like, “Oh, this is great.” But I don’t like thinking about numbers. I don’t want it to influence anything that I do. And so the Founders basically take seven days. Usually, I’m late on the episode. Tim Ferriss: Something in common with Dan Carlin. David Senra: Yeah. No, I’m five days late. He’s five months late. God, man. Tim Ferriss: Love you, Dan. You know that. David Senra: Yeah. He’s literally the best podcaster to ever live. So what I realized is if I was going to do this, I would need a team. And I don’t like working with other people because I’m difficult. I can be mean. I just am. And I don’t want to be mean. I really don’t. You mentioned earlier not getting some of the bad personality traits from them. And I was worried. I’ve asked friends, “Do you think I’m sociopathic? Am I all this?” They’re like, “No. You have empathy. You have a hard outer shell, but you’re really soft in the middle.” Patrick will tell you that. Tim Ferriss: Turtle. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. When I was in Japan, we went to some — what’s the ones where you have 20-course meals? Tim Ferriss: Oh, omakase. David Senra: Yeah. And they try to — Tim Ferriss: Which literally means, basically, I’ll leave it to you. Omakase is like, “Leave it to you.” So you can use it that way too, “Makaseru.” David Senra: Well, why do they call it omakase and it’s multiple — what does it have to do with — Tim Ferriss: Omakase, is you don’t pick anything à la carte. You let the chef. Sit down and they just give you what they want to give you. David Senra: Yes. And then they come in there, they make sure — Tim Ferriss: So you’re leaving it up to them. David Senra: But then they come in after everything and they want to talk to you about it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that’s very un-Japanese. That’s probably for foreigners. David Senra: Okay. So they tried to give me — Tim Ferriss: They might be like, “This is this,” and then they stop. But this guy was giving you little mini TED Talks? David Senra: No, he tried to get me to eat essence of turtle. It was baby turtle. I was like, “I’m not eating turtle.” Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t sound great. I’m not excited about essence of turtle. David Senra: Hey, the face you just made should be the turtle face. Tim Ferriss: I feel like if David Senra doesn’t work as a podcast name, you could have Essence of Turtle. David Senra: So what I realized is I need a team. So what I could see is eventually going down. Right now I’m making a new Founders episode every 10 to 14 days, which is not good. And I’ve tried to do every week. The cadence probably should be every two weeks. Me and Rick were talking about this this morning in regards to you, the same way. What’s that old apocryphal saying? “I would’ve wrote you a short letter, but I didn’t have time so I wrote you a long one.” He says me and you share that thing where the reading’s not taking longer, the recording’s not taking longer. It’s the editing before I do anything, it’s this wieldy, 15,000-word thing. I’m trying to get down to 5,000 words. Takes so long to do. So to answer your question, could see a future — I’m never going to stop doing Founders, where I have to reduce. It can’t be 52 a year. Second and biggest thing is I took an idea from one of Rockefeller’s biographies. So one of the things that I do that I also think is important is you read all the famous biographies, but you’ve got to go through the bibliographies. Books are made out of books. Everybody has read Titan by Ron Chernow. In the bibliography of that, there’s the best Rockefeller biography I’ve ever read, and I have eight at the house I haven’t read yet. I collect obscure Rockefeller biographies that I’ll eventually get to. Tim Ferriss: What’s your favorite one? David Senra: It’s called John D: The Founding Father of the Rockefellers, by David Freeman Hawke. Tim Ferriss: Better writer than a titler. David Senra: Yes. 250 pages instead of 800, but all about what you really want to know. You don’t want to know about where his grandfather was born. You want to know how he built Standard Oil. And there’s this idea in there that I’ve used called secret allies. And so this is going to answer your other question about podcasting, where he’s at the beginning of the oil industry. It’s the very beginning and he’s there. Tim Ferriss: Rough and tumble time. David Senra: Yeah. No one knows shit about oil refining. So what does he do? He goes and builds a network of secret allies with other oil refiners and then eventually do something that’s even more nefarious, which they start something called the Oil Refiners Association of America or something. And then he gets himself elected president to that. And then what happens is, it’s like if we had a podcaster union and I’m president of the podcaster union, and then I go to you and like, “Tim, what’s your downloads this month? And how much are you charging for ads? And then who’s your next guest?” And he’s getting all this data. So then he sees, “That’s a joker. That guy’s already out of business. He doesn’t even know it yet.” Tim Ferriss: “Oh, we don’t have to worry about that guy.” David Senra: Yeah. “That guy’s a killer. I need to buy his company and make him a partner.” And so this idea of secret allies. So I’m obsessed with podcasting. And so what I would go do, I’d go around and I would talk to any podcaster who would talk to me. And we talk about everything, downloads, ads, who you’re selling to, how are you selling, who are you using for editing. Tim Ferriss: Maybe that’s the spider sense I got. David Senra: No. No, because I give. I give — Tim Ferriss: I know, I’m kidding. I’m kidding. David Senra: There’s people, literally, they’ll even tell you. There’s podcasters that literally, I took an idea from one podcast and gave it to another podcast because that’s the whole thing. I don’t collect it and hold it. We spread it around and they’ve made millions and millions of dollars from these ideas. Tim Ferriss: I have a friend named Kevin Kelly. Kevin Rose does that too. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Just gives away. Derek Sivers does it too. Gives away as many as possible. And if he can’t get rid of one that keeps him up at night, it’s like, “All right.” David Senra: If you’re talking about podcast data, who’s the mad scientist of podcast data? Chris Hutchins. Me and you’ve talked to him. We both talked to him. He has good shit because he tells you stuff and he tells me stuff that I didn’t know. And he’s this weird mad scientist, but he’s in this weird part of podcasting I don’t even think about. Tim Ferriss: All the Hacks. People, check him out. David Senra: Yeah. He’s been on your podcast twice. Tim Ferriss: Once because he wanted to have this long conversation with me about a bunch of stuff I was doing. And I was like, “If we’re going to do that, make it good with your questions and we’ll just record it. And then I can share it because I don’t want to answer all these questions over and over again.” It was about podcasting. David Senra: It’s a great idea. And so basically, I took that idea. So anyways, I was able to build a lot of relationships with a lot of great podcasters who are friends who share information. But then you also see, “Oh, wait, there’s a lot of disparity between podcast teams and stuff.” And so Rob Mohr and Andrew Huberman tried to recruit me years ago, because they have a podcast network called SciComm that they really don’t do much with because it’s really hard to launch another health podcast when they’re dominating that vertical. Is there another Huberman in that vertical that’s not discovered? Unlikely. And power laws were everything around us. And so I got this crazy DM and then a phone call with Rob, and he’s just like, “Dude, who are you?” And this is when I had, again, 5,000 listeners. And he’s like, “I’ve never come across anything like this.” And then we wound up talking. I think every single time we talked, it was over — this is on the phone, for over two hours every time and it’s all about podcasting. And then they’re like, “We’re looking for other Hubermans, and you’re this giant nerd that loves reading obscure shit and breaking it down in an entertaining manner just like Andrew does.” And he’s like, “Would you be interested in joining us on SciComm?” And I was like, “You are two weeks too late because it’s not announced yet. But I have a verbal agreement with this guy named Patrick and I’m joining Colossus.” But we still became friends and everything else. And so basically me and Rob, we’d spent a lot of time, I spend my summers in Malibu, so I see them all the time. And I’ve talked to Andrew and they’re just killers. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re very good at what they do. David Senra: They’re just operationally excellent. And they have a small but mighty team, and every single person in that team, they’re very focused. So their photographer’s one of the best photographers. Their editor’s one of the best editors. Their video people are some of the best video people. Their internet guy’s one of the best internet guys. It’s just everything. And so their whole point was — I was like, “Listen, Founders is never going anywhere. It’s staying on Colossus. It’s staying exactly what it is. But if I do something new, I’ll let you know.” And so when I went to them, it was just like, “Here’s the thing. I am going to pick the guests. I’m highly disagreeable. I will never take direction from anybody. I want to pick the guests and I want to have the conversations. And then everything else has to be A-plus team around me. And that means from visuals, to editing, to clips, to every single thing.” And they’re operationally excellent. I have not met a better — just spend time with them. Tim Ferriss: Very well-architected. David Senra: And then the way they built their business is genius.Tim Ferriss: So what does success look like for you two years from now? Three, five, pick your time frame. David Senra: Oh, success looks the same now and forever that I’m proud of what I made. That’s it. I don’t care what the numbers are. I love the climb. Tim Ferriss: Let’s say this show does really well. David Senra: Oh, it is going to. Tim Ferriss: So David Senra does really well. And not saying Rob would do this, but you know what we would really love to do is a third show, and it’s incredibly compelling, maybe it’s a slightly different angle or a totally different angle. Who knows? Who the hell knows? Interviewing spouses of all these famous people, which I think would actually be an amazing podcast. I’m sure someone’s doing it. But besides the quality of the product and being proud of the product, there is such a thing as too many different products. David Senra: Oh, sure. Tim Ferriss: There is such a thing as simply burning the candle at both ends. So you’re at a battery capacity that compromises the product, maybe long-term or your life. You’ve got more considerations than just business. So how do you think about those other factors when you telescope out a few years? David Senra: I’m not a long-term planner. So I would say I’m basically non-analytical at all. I go straight off intuition. Steve Jobs says this great line where he thinks intuition is more important than intelligence, and that intuition played a larger role in his success than anything else. Intuition and perseverance. And so I used to think I was more analytical and I have a five-year plan, a 10-year plan. All a great life is, is a string of great days. And so the furthest I plan out is 24 hours. I actually have this weird — I don’t even know if I should say this publicly. I don’t think humans actually understand time at all. And when you say a decade, yeah, we know a decade’s 10 years. But do we actually understand what that means? I think we maybe understand a week, a month. We definitely understand a day because that’s how we live. We live 24 hours at a time. And so all I try to do is like, “Can I design a day that I really enjoyed?” And not hedonistic. I’m not laying around doing nothing. I have to work. I feel guilt and shame when I’m not being productive. And that’s probably a bad thing. There’s all reasons that you could psychoanalyze why that is the case, but I just know how I am. I like to work. I like to get up and get after it. I don’t like taking vacations. The stuff I get invited to is crazy. I like to work. I like podcasting. I’m obsessed with it. Everybody’s like, “We talked about this multiple times. Why don’t you do something else?” I like doing this. I will keep doing this. So to answer your question, I just try to make a great day. And the way I make a great day is I want to wake up, I want to take care of my health. I want to read. I want to make a product I’m really proud of and I want to spend time with people that I love and admire. And I’m going to do that the next day and the next day and the next day. And I think if I have a great day today and a great day tomorrow and a shitty day a month from now and then a better day the next day and I get through my life and it’s just a string of great days, that will be a great life. And so two years from now, I don’t know because if you asked me two years ago, I said, “There’s no way I’m going to do another podcast.” But I would say my answer is that simple. The maxim I like about this is I love the climb. I don’t care where the summit is. I just like the activity for the sake of itself, and so therefore, I’m going to do it. And I hope it’s well-received. But I couldn’t have predicted that Founders was going to turn out the way it was. So I don’t know. I’m just going to do great work that I’m completely fascinated by and it gives me energy. And on the other side of that, this is what Stephen King said, “I’m not just the writer. I’m the first reader.” I listen to every single episode of Founders before anybody else and I just threw out one. The book is great, Bill Walsh’s The Score Takes Care of Itself. I read it for the first time five, six years ago. I read it again. Love the book. I made a podcast on it. It’s an hour and 15 minutes long. I finished editing it. I listened to it, not good enough, threw it away. That’s it. Can I make something that I’m proud of? Tim Ferriss: So I believe all of that and I want to push on a little bit. David Senra: Go for it, please. Tim Ferriss: Because the great days make great lives, I agree with. But now your circle of interaction is expanding with a show that involves other people with very busy schedules. So to what extent are you going to be traveling to all these people versus having people travel to you? That type of decision has longer-term implications, right? So I’m curious how you think about that. David Senra: So the way I think about this is this goes to the other side of me that’s probably not healthy, that I have a ruthless competitive drive that I think would terrify most people. I have a very negative inner monologue that I never think I’m doing enough. I have multiple people depending on me financially, way above and beyond just your wife and kids, other people that I have to make sure that I can take care of, so I have a lot of pressure on me. I want the pressure. So, to answer your question, it’s like I’ll do whatever it takes to win. And so, if that means I’ve got to get on a plane, or I get a little less sleep, then that’s what’s going to happen. But I also think you’re also smart, and you can think about these things, like okay, you want to talk to extreme winners in business, is essentially — not really starter/founders, I want people that have decades of experience. Every single person, if you look at the people that we’ve been recording with so long, I’m just more interested in talking to people that have done things for a long time, that are smarter and more productive and better than I am. And so, setting up here, where we are in New York, is probably a good idea because everybody comes through New York. Now, we’ve recorded several in L.A., here’s also a thing to consider, most of the people I’m talking to have planes. Rick pulls me aside and says this all the time, multiple people have told me this, you don’t understand the impact that you’re having on people, because I don’t think about it. I’m by myself all the time, I don’t look at numbers. And so, people have literally gotten their jets and flown across the country because I was like, “Hey, can you do it on this day in L.A.? Are the teams there? It’s more convenient.” And they do it because they think I’ve done something for them, but I’m just like, “No, no, no, I haven’t done anything for you, I just thank you for listening. The fact that you listen to my podcast means I get to do this for a living.” This is more Munger has really heavily basically influenced my thinking, it’s just like the reciprocation tendency in humans is so pronounced and it’s evolved. Yes, and it’s never going away, and what I didn’t understand and I still don’t understand, because I don’t like talking about, I don’t like thinking about this shit. I think about, like, as if I’m talking to one person is the fact that so many people have gotten value. Every single person’s recorded an episode with us for the new show so far has listened to a ton of shows of mine. And their point was it’s important work, and it’s more — Todd Graves has actually told me this two weeks ago. He’s like, “It’s important work and it’s more important the bigger your company gets.” Because if I can hear a single idea, or either avoid a mistake or get a good idea — Tim Ferriss: That’s true. David Senra: — and it makes a one percent difference on my business, that’s — I can’t do math, I can’t do public math. A billion dollars, whatever the number is, $2 billion. It’s a huge — no, that’d be 10 percent. So, if it makes a 10 percent difference in his business, it’s a huge swing. And so, so far, and again, you have a private jet, where do you actually live? Wherever you have to — Tim Ferriss: Also, your carrying costs for that jet are pretty high. David Senra: Yeah, so I — Tim Ferriss: So, there’s a little bit of pressure just to utilize the damn thing. David Senra: You want to hear something funny? I’ll go back to why I think New York and L.A. is going to be where I’m recording most of these. And we’re willing to travel, we will if we have to. If Dyson says, “Come do it,” I’m coming to England, I don’t give a shit. So, Sam Zell told me, he’s like, “I told you that lunch I had with him changed my life?” He’s like, “Don’t make the same mistake,” he’s like, “I know all the rich guys,” and he says, “first of all, they’re all guys…” That’s what he told me. He goes, “Two, you’d be surprised how many of them are miserable. And they do stuff they don’t like for more money that they can’t spend, and then they make the same mistake, where they buy slight…” This is his word, it’s not mine. He goes, “they buy slightly nicer versions of the same shit.” He goes, “The difference between a $10 million house and a 30 million house is negligible.” And he’s like, “I own my place in Chicago, and my compound in Malibu,” that’s the word he used, compound. And he goes, “I rent everything else.” He goes, “The things that you own start to own you.” And he said every year, after, I think, Thanksgiving and in between Christmas, he’d take his entire family, extended family, to this little village in France. And he said, he’s always a shit talker. And he said funny things, he goes, “I could buy the whole village.” He goes, “I don’t, I rent it, and then I don’t think about it until I go back. It’s somebody else’s problem.” And he goes, “There’s only one true luxury in life,” he goes, “it’s a private jet, try to get to private jet money.” And he is like, “I use my jet three hours a day.” On average, he uses jet three hours a day. He was in South Florida, because he’s like, “I woke up in Chicago this morning, I got on my jet, I went across the street, gave a talk to a bunch of investors and entrepreneurs,” because that’s what he wanted to spend his last days doing. He knew he was dying, he didn’t tell me though, I didn’t know that. We were scheduled to have another dinner, and it got canceled and they said he was sick, I was like, oh, he got COVID. He died three weeks later, so I never got to see him again. But the way he was spending his last days, at his own expense, traveling all over the world on his beautiful giant plane, spending a lot of money, is passing on the knowledge that he learned through 61 years to other investors and younger and entrepreneurs. And so he goes, “I did that this morning, came over here, had lunch, I’m going to get in my car, and go back to Chicago.” He used it three hours a day. So, so far people have been willing to fly to come to us, I’ll come to some people if they’re super busy schedules, and then I think just setting up in a place where they all will come through would make a lot of sense. Tim Ferriss: Anyone on your wish list that you haven’t been able to track down? David Senra: No, surprisingly, again, I don’t like thinking about this, where I don’t understand that today, right now, if I do an episode on somebody living, it’s going to get to them. They might not be a listener, but — this just happened with Jimmy Iovine. So I have these weird, people are always surprised, they think, who’s on your list? Obviously I respect Bezos, respect Elon, all of them, but I would say like Todd Graves, they’re like, “What the hell’s wrong with you? And James Dyson. The vacuum cleaner guy?” I’m weirdly obsessed with these people. And so, one of the people I’m obsessed with is Jimmy Iovine. And Jimmy Iovine, Defiant Ones. Tim Ferriss: Such a good series. David Senra: I watch it — Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God, it is so well done. If anyone hasn’t seen Defiant Ones, go watch it. It’s head spinningly good. David Senra: With the description of the four-part documentaries, oh, it’s a relationship between Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. Yeah, it’s really a documentary about entrepreneurship, it’s about chasing a path — chasing a path, there’s no path in front of you. There was no path for Dre to get out of Compton, there’s no path from Jimmy to get, for the son of a longshoreman in Brooklyn, to go what happened to him. He’s fascinating. And then this is my point about what do you actually value in life? Jimmy’s a billionaire. I don’t know, he’s got a billion, $2 billion, whatever the case is, I’d be more interested in that than if he had $100 billion. If you asked me whose life would you want, Buffett or Munger, Buffett was 100 times richer, I’m taking Munger every day. What I like about Jimmy is that he lived an interesting life. The episode, you see it on Defiant Ones, crazy stories in there, but Rick Rubin, who, you mentioned, if podcasting is saturated, which we can get to, Rick Rubin’s really good because he’s a world-class listener. He took a skillset, what was his skill for the work that he did? Why are these musicians hiring him? To listen, to hear something they don’t hear, and to suggest something they might not hear, might not understand. And the episode he did with Jimmy Iovine I think came out in 2023, I think it was the single best podcast I listened to all year. And it’s just Jimmy Iovine telling insane story after insane story about the music business, because the music business is a wild business. And what I like about my business is that it’s a unique experience generator. It creates opportunities and experiences you can’t buy, and the amount of people I get to meet and talk to — my memoirs are going to be wild because of the weird dinners I’ve been to, and the planes I’ve been on, and the boats I’ve been on, and it started because I was a giant nerd, with a giant head, sitting in a room by himself for five years, just mainlining biography after biography after biography. Jimmy’s really interesting to me, and then what happened is, I don’t even — part of this, I can’t tell you how I got connected, he agreed to do the show, and one of the previous guests is the one that connected me, which again, I just don’t feel I deserve how nice these people have been to me and what they’re willing to do, and I don’t even like asking them for this. But it got to Jimmy — Tim Ferriss: Is that true? David Senra: No, I don’t like — the worst possible — Tim Ferriss: You put a lot of work into your podcast. David Senra: It doesn’t matter though, the worst possible thing — Buffett has — Tim Ferriss: Do you feel like you don’t deserve it? I feel like that’s an important question. David Senra: Buffett has a — I’ll answer that question in a minute. Buffett has the line’s, it’s like, “The people that win are the ones that their eyes are on the field, not the scoreboard.” I don’t — I was going for a walk last night, and you know this happens to you all time, I’m way earlier, you’re like an OG, man, you’ve been famous way — I still, when people stop me on the street, which happens, I’m like, “How do you know what I look like?” Tim Ferriss: No, that’s going to happen more and more. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. So, I’ve read all your blog posts about this too. I was on the phone with Morgan Housel this morning, who’s a big fan of yours. Tim Ferriss: Great guy. David Senra: Obviously you guys are friends. And we were talking about that, security around this, and all this other stuff, and then we were talking about you. Morgan’s just a peach of a human, he’s the opposite of me. Tim Ferriss: Psychology of Money, great book. David Senra: It won’t stop selling, won’t stop selling. Tim Ferriss: I know. Yeah. Got lightning in a bottle on that one. Yeah. Earned it. Earned it too. David Senra: Oh, 100 percent. And the nicest guy. If you think you want to find my directional opposite, and we’ll go back to the question you think is important, Morgan genuinely believes that his ceiling that he should have — he should be an insurance salesman somewhere in the Midwest, making 100,000 a year. And the fact that this guy got really, really wealthy — Tim Ferriss: Astronomical numbers. David Senra: Yes. Really, really wealthy, and just wakes up every day, can’t believe his life. I wake up every day like, “Why am I not a billionaire?” It’s like, he’s happy in a way I will never be, and this is why I think Daniel Ek’s advice about chasing — Daniel does not believe, this is one of the first things I asked him on the show, was — he was the one that put this idea out there that life is not about happiness, it’s about impact. He is not chasing happiness, he’s chasing impact. And he’s the one that actually convinced Dara, the founder of Uber, tells the story, they were having drinks — Tim Ferriss: Dara is CEO. David Senra: CEO. Yeah, sorry. Good distinction. I met Travis too. Most intense person I’ve ever been in contact with. Tim Ferriss: He is one hell of a builder, man. David Senra: Oh, for sure. Tim Ferriss: And different batteries. David Senra: Most intense. And I’ve been around a lot of intense, he is — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. He’s — David Senra: Very fascinating. Tim Ferriss: — he has different gears than most people. David Senra: Oh, and the storytelling, and the — he’s a phenomenal storyteller, phenomenal communicator. So, anyways, when Dara was going back and forth about becoming CEO of Uber, he said originally was going to say no because he was pretty happy with his life, and Daniel, in a very direct way, was like, “When’s life about happiness? It’s about impact. It’s like one of the most important companies in the world, and you can have an impact on it. You can have an impact on the way cities are changed. You absolutely have to do this.” And I think that’s a really interesting idea. So, I am trying to have impact. So, to answer your question, do I think I deserve it? I obviously know that I put a lot of work into it, and I believe that the product is good, and I think I found what I’ve put on the planet to do, but I don’t like thinking about it. I don’t like thinking about its impact on other people. I like it because I like it. I make it, I’m like, I would listen to this podcast, I think it’s valuable. I think you start doing shit for the wrong reasons — I talked to a lot of the head people at Spotify, and they said the biggest mistake, one of the biggest mistakes they made is the great thing about podcasting is that people that come up like we did, through the garage. You just started — I listened to your first episode. I remember TimTim TalkTalk. Tim Ferriss: TimTim Talk. David Senra: Yeah, I remember. Tim Ferriss: From my kitchen table. David Senra: With a friend. And why did you do it? I think you had a couple glasses of wine, right? And with a friend, because you’re like, I don’t — Tim Ferriss: Figured it out pretty quickly after listening to episode one that the second episode was going to be sober. David Senra: Oh, man. Tim Ferriss: Josh Waitzkin, number two. David Senra: Yeah. But you come up with, you did it because you were curious, you only talked to people you really want to talk to, you had no production costs. And so, Spotify said they flipped it. They’re like, we took something that was low production costs done by enthusiasts and people in the garage. Huberman’s analogy of this is, it’s punk rock. Punk rock is great because it started with people that just wanted to play in the garage, and then they got good, and then they played for stadiums. And so, Spotify’s like, oh, what we did was we took a low production cost, made a high production cost because we had these big contracts, and then we hired celebrities, and no one listened, and the people that did listen, they stopped because the celebrities were just doing it for money, they didn’t do it because they love it. And I think that’s the key. It’s like, I truly love this, I did it for five and a half years when no one was listening. That tells you that I love it. But I think one of the worst things you could do is, I’m going to do it because status is the funny thing. Podcasting is dorky, it’s low status. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. David Senra: In 2016, you think that was fucking high status? Tim Ferriss: No. David Senra: No. It was like, “You dorky nerd with a podcast.” Tim Ferriss: And to be clear, I’m not asking if you’re seeking status, it was more if you feel that you’re unworthy of people flying to you and doing these things, those are two very different — David Senra: No, yeah, I meant I think you see this now, that podcasting is obviously very influential and can be — there’s so many people jumping into it that clearly don’t love it. They like it because the CPMs are high or whatever, or they want to be famous. I had no video for eight years, do you think I want to be famous? Do you think I want to be recognized? No, I obviously don’t. I had to fucking had the most powerful person in podcasting berate me at dinner, in a nice way, saying, you idiot, you have to do video. That’s the only reason I do video because Daniel told me to. And how smart am I if I don’t listen to him? Then I’m an idiot. I have to do it. I don’t like doing it. So, I don’t know, man. I don’t know. I think at some point the platform gets big enough, like, “I flew here for this. Why? Because you have a massive platform, and you’re willing to extend it to me, and I’d travel wherever. You say. Iceland? I’m coming to Iceland, brother. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, I knew you like Argentina, let’s go down there. We’ll do an Argentina. So, yeah, I think eventually, when they see it’s big enough, that people would come to you, also try to make it easier, and I’m not doing it in Columbia, Missouri, I’m doing it in New York or L.A., you’re going to be there anyways.” Tim Ferriss: And also with the particular cohort that you’re interviewing with jets, if they’re like, “Sure, I’ll fly to New York,” and then they can also set up five other meetings with friends or business associates, or fill in the blank. David Senra: Make it easy. But I think really, man, I do this — I don’t, this is the turtle in me. I don’t like asking. Tim Ferriss: This is the turtle. David Senra: You can ask all the people that — we have a bunch of mutual close friends, I don’t like asking for help. And I think one of the weird ways that I think I built true friendships with some of these people is because all day long it’s, give me, give me, give me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I have never asked Rick for anything. I think one time to crash at his house, that’s it. All I want is to be homies, to be friends. I don’t want anything from this. And I think I didn’t understand because I didn’t come from this background, that when you’re high profile, and you’re building these empires, these are all empire builders. All day long they’re just surrounded by people that want something from them. And I’m just like, here, I have this podcast that might be valuable for you, you want it? I don’t want anything from you. And when they tell me, ask me for stuff, I still don’t like doing it. I don’t like doing it. It really hurt me to, would you be on my show? But I was like, all right, well, if I’m going to ask for something, I’ll do this. And not a single person I’ve asked has said no. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you love what you do, that is essential to producing the quality that you produce. It’s essential for the endurance to sort of outperform and outlast, because podcasting as a whole is just an elephant graveyard of three to 10 episode shows. So, if you choose something you really like, that you would make because you intrinsically enjoy it, if it’s an outgrowth of reading the biographies, taking the notes, and you’re like, well, this is really sort of in terms of additional work for me on top of something I might already be doing, actually not like the majority of the pie, and you have the fuel of that obsession you’re going to do well, even if it’s just for yourself, but certainly with the longevity you have the competitive advantage of durability. David Senra: That means a lot coming from you, and everything you’ve accomplished, and I think you actually hit to the essence of it, where it’s like, I can’t sleep after these things. I had to get up the next day when I was in Austin, I think I had a 7:00 a.m. flight, and I slept maybe three hours because just gem after gem after gem from Michael Dell. Or you’ll see this on the Todd Graves episode, dude, we were the same person. We’re the same person. And so, we’re spontaneously high-fiving — I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of, “This guy’s a dork.” Like, “Hey, give me another high-five, buddy.” We were just geeking out about minute details of just being obsessed with, his whole thing is do one thing and doing it better than anybody else. And I remember going from the airport, it was in Baton Rouge, and I immediately called Sam, who’s the closest thing I have to a mentor, and I was like, “I’m in trouble,” and he’s like, “Why?” I go, “I’m addicted to doing these things already, I can’t stop.” This was crazy. Tim Ferriss: It’s a good sign. David Senra: Crazy. Tim Ferriss: That’s how I pick my projects, largely, it’s how I pick some of my startups too that I get involved with. If I have what I would call good insomnia, for at least a few nights in a given week, and then I try to quell it, it doesn’t matter how much Trazodone I take, or anything else, I just am so excited by something that my mind is worrying and I can’t go to sleep, I’m like, okay, there’s probably something there. Also because it seems to be such an energetic unlock, I’m like, even if that one thing doesn’t do very well, if I can create this nuclear power from that, it’s not compartmentalized, it can apply to other things. So, I get it. I get it. Now, I was listening to, I don’t know how I found it — actually, I was going on, I think it’s Tom Papa’s show. He’s a comedian, great interviewer, and I was going on his show, this is a while ago, and I was doing some homework on my own, listened to an interview he did where he interviewed Joe Rogan. And I’m paraphrasing here obviously, but Rogan effectively said, he’s like, “Yeah, I don’t really think much about discipline or willpower,” he said, “what I do have though is obsession. And when I find something that I’m obsessed with, when I deep dive, it’s like I don’t need to worry about discipline. I don’t need to worry about willpower.” So, it’s like finding that thing that you are obsessed by. David Senra: I think 100 percent right. Tim Ferriss: And so I think you’ve done that. You’ve done that. So, you’ve found your lane. A lot of people don’t find it, right? They don’t find that thing. It’s like you wonder if Kobe Bryant were born somewhere and didn’t have the chance to pick up basketball, would it have been something else? Maybe if you were Michael Jordan, okay, it’s baseball or this or that, but it’s like, you found your thing, that’s kind of amazing. David Senra: No, I appreciate it. And the way I think about it’s, it took me 32 years to find my path, and five and a half years of struggle before I could even pay my bills. It was a long time. Kobe found it — imagine finding it at 12 like he did, and knowing. I read the 600-page biography on him by Roland Lazenby. And the middle school guidance counselor is like, he wrote down, “What are you going to do?” He’s like, “I’m going to play in the NBA.” He’s like, “You need to pick something else, that’s a one in a million shot.” He goes, “I’m going to be that one in a million.” To be that so sure at 12 years old, and this is what goes back to the lack of introspection. I had a lot of angst, and what is the meaning of life, or what am I doing here? And then once you find your thing, there’s like a, definitely not resting on laurels, but there is almost a relief, like — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: Because it’s not just finding something you love to do, it’s like, what is that — you’re like a Japanese encyclopedia. Ikigai, what is the — Tim Ferriss: Ikigai, yeah. David Senra: Yeah, it’s like the intersection of what you love to do, what you’re good at, and what’s good for the world. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. Ikigai gets used in a bunch of different ways. Japan’s always good for these pithy, conceptual words. David Senra: I think, I’m just going to be blasphemous for you, but I think travel is generally overrated, after you do it — Tim Ferriss: I am not jumping in — David Senra: — after you do it for a while. Because the problem is we keep going to all the nice places, and all the nice places are all the same to each other. The one thing that Japan blew my mind and why it’s the top of my list now of everywhere I’ve been, and where I’d want to go again is because it’s one of the few truly distinct cultures in the world. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a wild one. They also, they’re kind of like a chameleon, because they pull so much from other cultures. So, when it was in isolation, it was certainly an alien environment, and then you look at everything they’ve incorporated, and in some cases, in the case of, say, The Toyota Way, right? David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You have, I guess it was, I want to say Deming? David Senra: Yep. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right. Who was basically, not ignored, but certainly not embraced in his country of birth, gets adopted by the Japanese, and you see them do this over and over and over again. So, yes, it’s a fascinating place, and I would agree with you that especially people who travel in the lap of, it doesn’t need to be luxury, it could just be comfort — like rich person travel is the most boring shit in the world. David Senra: Same stores, same — Tim Ferriss: It’s just like, okay, you’re going to the Four Seasons in 12 different places, getting on the Wi-Fi, doing whatever it is you would’ve been doing at home, and then going to the most expensive meals, it’s just not interesting. So, I think if anybody wants a great book on the art of long-term world travel, if that’s of interest, Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. David Senra: I read that because of you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: The amount of books in my library because of you. I did the same thing with you that I did with all these other people, it’s like, oh, Tim says to read it, I read it.Tim Ferriss: And a lot of these books, they’re underneath it all, at least in the case of Rolf Potts’ book, Vagabonding, they’re really philosophical operating systems, and it’s a hat you can try on. You don’t have to wear it forever, but it’s like, okay, if you only have one jacket to wear, which is six gear workaholic, neglecting family guy, just expand your wardrobe. You can always put that jacket back on, you just hang it up for a moment. And similarly, I like these books, and they certainly can be business books, whether it’s Branson, who is in some ways, he took risks, but he’s kind of the opposite, at least in a lot of capacities to a Dyson. He risk mitigates the hell out of his ventures, and caps the downside in so many creative ways. David Senra: Like his airline. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. So, the artistry of deal making for minimizing or capping downside is one of Branson’s superpowers. Even though the stuff on the magazine covers back in the day, it was like, the mad man, who’s doing X, Y, Z, and has the models, and he’s — David Senra: Phenomenal marketer. Tim Ferriss: — and he’s kite boarding with a naked model on his back. You remember that? David Senra: That’s literally the picture I have in my mind. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God. David Senra: That looks fun. Tim Ferriss: He is also, can be a wild man. But I digress. I was just going to say that these are hats that you can put on to test them out as philosophical operating systems, which is how I pick a lot of the books. Yeah. Books, books, books. I was very similar to you when I was a kid, and also all throughout, just living in books, living and living in books, and — David Senra: It’s very common though in these stories. Rockefeller, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Edwin Land, Winston Churchill — the way I say this is like they don’t just read, they devour entire shelves. There’s multiple examples of Thomas Edison, Thomas Edison read every single book in the Detroit library. Edwin Land read every single book on light in Harvard, then dropped out because he didn’t think he had anything else to learn, moves to New York City, I think one of the most beautiful buildings is the one we passed on the way here, the New York City Public Library, read every single book on light in there, and then is like, okay, I learned enough, now I can do my experiments. They just devour entire shelves. Tim Ferriss: Monster. David Senra, what have we not talked about? People will be able to find, of course, the show. Davidsenra.com. David Senra: Yep. Tim Ferriss: Is that the best website? David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And David Senra: David Senra on all social channels, Instagram, X — Tim Ferriss: All social channels. David Senra: Podcast app — Tim Ferriss: Founders podcast, of course, founderspodcast.com David Senra: I appreciate you, you’ve included me in your newsletter in the past — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. David Senra: — on your blog. I read all your shit. And I’m like — and I didn’t even know, it’s shocking to me when I’m like, oh, because it’s not like you told me. I was like, what the hell? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you put out. The obsession and attention to detail doesn’t surprise me at all, when you told me about going through your transcripts by hand, I’m like, yeah, that makes sense. And I really have my fingers crossed for you, I don’t think you need any luck, but that David Senra is as durable as Founders podcast. If anybody can do it, you can do it. David Senra: I appreciate it. It means a lot coming from you, man. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Congratulations. David Senra: You’ve had a huge influence on me. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks man. David Senra: It’s long overdue, like I said, I ran into the hallway and grabbed you. I was like, “It’s been too long — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very, very, very long overdue. So, everybody listening, check out David Senra, I’m excited to check it out. David Senra: Thank you, brother.Tim Ferriss: And also know the team at Huberman Lab, Andrew, Rob, those guys are all top tier, so what’s coming is going to be absolutely top-notch.

David Senra: Brad Jacobs is, I think, the only person in history to start eight separate billion dollar companies. A lot of people on the West Coast, they don’t really know who he is because he’s just been an East Coast guy his whole life, but he started his first company when he was like 23. He’s 68 years old. He’s by far the most energetic person I have ever been around and he wrote this book called How to Make a Few Billion Dollars. Tim Ferriss: What are some of his companies with? What industries and so on? David Senra: He’s like the roll-up king. He’d roll up logistics companies and trucking companies and now he’s got a massive one that he just took public that’s doing building supplies. Early in your career you might roll up a $5 million company or a $20 million company. His first acquisition I think was like $9 billion. He just gets progressively bigger and bigger and bigger. What I find interesting about him is usually when you study extreme winners, and he’s obviously an extreme winner, what motivates them is kind of dark like issues with their father, some kind of insecurity, never felt good enough. They grew up poor and they felt they were born in the wrong place. Brad does it out of love. He’s got no negativity. He’s just a very special human being and the fact that I get to text him and call him and go to his house is insane. He’s just an amazing human being.Tim Ferriss: There’s another legend who defeated roulette and then went on to beat the market, Ed Thorp, probably another exception where — David Senra: The exception. Tim Ferriss: The exception where he did not eviscerate his personal life in the quest for business mastery. David Senra: I don’t think anybody’s mastered life clearly as much as Ed Thorp did. Your two interviews that you did with him were incredible. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. That was such a moment of gratitude to have the chance to interview him, especially because he is so, so sharp at his age. I can’t recall his exact age right now. David Senra: It’s like 89 or something like that. Tim Ferriss: If you want a holistic figure to consider emulating, Ed Thorp would be on a very, very, very short list. David Senra: I can think of three out of 400. Tim Ferriss: Who are the three? David Senra: Ed Thorp is at the top. Sol Price who’s the one that invented essentially the warehouse model like Costco, Jim Sinegal was mentored by Sol Price when Jim Sinegal was 18. Jim Sinegal, founder of Costco, built one of the greatest companies in history and he has this great line in Sol Price’s autobiography. Sol Price’s son wrote his biography. People are like, when Sol died, like, “You must have learned a lot from Sol.” He goes, “No, I didn’t learn a lot. I learned everything. Everything that I know I learned from this guy.” Sol Price, same thing, good husband, good father, didn’t chase after more money at the expense of other areas of his life after he already had enough money. Ed Thorp turned down so much, hundreds of millions, if not billions. He could have collected. He was just like, “I already have more money than I can ever spend. Why would I do that?” Then, I would say Brunello Cucinelli. Tim Ferriss: How are those examples different? You should explain for folks. I mean, look, everything I’m wearing I got for free. You should explain to people. I did not know the last name you mentioned until a few years ago because I won’t doxx him, but my friend Tony is basically covered in Brunello. Who is this? David Senra: Brunello Cucinelli wrote this, I don’t even know the name. I read the book. It’s like it’s something about Solomeo. Essentially, he sells $5,000 sweaters. He sells sweaters that were more than my first car, but he grew up in very rural Italy. Then, everybody at the time, there was just essentially the hollowing out of his community. Everybody had moved to the cities. He is a very soulful dude.Brunello essentially works. He essentially bounds his life where it’s like you work 9:00 to 5:00. You are not allowed to send an email to the company after 5:00. You have to take a break for lunch and they have this great Italian food. Then, he spends his nights reading and then going on long walks and then sitting in the cafes in this little town that he essentially rebuilt and reinvested in. He likes having cappuccino and debating philosophy. He’s just like a real soulful dude. Now the one criticism people have is like that business model works when you have 70 percent margins and your sweaters are as much as a Honda Civic, but it was very intentional. I don’t care what people do. It’s very intentional.Tim Ferriss:Let me come back to this question of clean fuel versus let’s call it dirty fuel and there’s a lot in between. I don’t want to look at it in a totally binary way, but why do you think of the say 400 plus that you can only call to mind three or four, Ed Thorp, Sol Price, Brunello Cucinelli, Brad Jacobs? Why are there so few who seem driven in that particular, let’s just call it positive way, or that they can pursue business excellence without having a lot of collateral damage in their personal lives? What do you draw from that? Look, maybe these are just different animals and out of the box these four are just fundamentally different from the other 396 or so, but what is your take on that thin slice of the total? David Senra: I would add another one to the list. You’ve also interviewed him, Michael Dell. Recently, I’ve spent hours and hours with him. We had a five hour dinner and then I just recorded a two and a half hour conversation with him for the new show. He is in love. His is very positive. Now he has a big fear of failure, which almost I think me and you probably share this. I won’t speak for you. I want to ask you actually. I am way more afraid of failure than I love winning. Tim Ferriss: I mean that’s true for everyone I know who wins a lot. I don’t think I can think of a single exception in terms of someone who celebrates the wins as much as they punish themselves for the losses. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, I’m just saying that’s pattern matching. David Senra: Even now with all the success that you’ve had, is your inner monologue still negative? Tim Ferriss: I mean there’s a lot of negative. I’m working on that. I look at some of the, I don’t want to call them maxims, but you’ve quoted the, I think it was the founder of the Four Seasons, David Senra: Excellence is the capacity to take pain. Tim Ferriss: Right, and there may be some truth to that, but I feel like it’s very risky for me to take something like that and wear it as a marching order for life because I already tilt in that direction and not all pain is productive. I think for me when you are already tilted in that direction where you believe if there isn’t pain, if there isn’t some degree of suffering, then you’re not trying hard enough. It’s very easy to become a hammer looking for nails and that can have a lot of repercussions for your relationships also. David Senra: For sure. Tim Ferriss: If your self-talk is negative, at least in my experience, what I’ve seen in a lot of my friends and peers and founders, very often you end up having a similar type of dialogue with people around you. That can have huge repercussions. That doesn’t give anyone a neat, tidy silver bullet of an answer, but the negative self-talk, there’s a place for it. The nuance to me matters a lot. If it’s like, “You’re a piece of shit. You always do X. Why don’t you do Y,” and that has a good outcome, I would still want to refine the process. David Senra: I read this biography of Jensen Huang, which is fascinating, because it’s right after one of the best quarters in NVIDIA history. He starts this meeting and he says, “I woke up this morning, looked in the mirror, and said, ‘Why do you suck so much?’” Tim Ferriss: He’s hardcore. David Senra: He’s very hardcore. Tim Ferriss: He’s hardcore. He’s hardcore. I guess what I’d also like to ask you is about not necessarily the people you study, and hopefully you take this as a compliment. It’s intended like a highest compliment. When people ask me about you they’re like, “So what’s the story? Why do people like this stuff?” I’m like, “Well, I can only really speculate,” but I feel like you are, in a way, what Dan Carlin did with Hardcore History, you do for business. Hardcore History is my favorite podcast of all. David Senra: I think Dan Carlin’s the greatest podcaster that ever lived. The reason I do a solo history show is because of Dan Carlin. I’ve given away his back catalog. I wish he would change his business model. Tim Ferriss: It is a bit janky, but if you want to just listen to the greats, I mean the “Wrath of the Khans” — David Senra: “Blueprint for Armageddon”, “Wrath of the Khans”, I think is the best podcast series ever created, in my opinion. “Blueprint for Armageddon”, just everything, I’ve listened to them. I’ve listened. He only has like 55 episodes. He was doing it for 15 years. I fall asleep at night. Right now last night I fell asleep listening to his new one. It’s not even new. It’s like six months old because he never released any episodes, “Mania for Subjugation Part Two”, about the relationship between Alexander the Great and King Philip. Tim Ferriss: Amazing. David Senra: He just puts me to sleep. He is the greatest. Tim Ferriss: The reason that I mentioned that is I feel like I’ve learned so much from Dan Carlin. I’ve learned so much from your episodes. I’m curious though, as I know another person, you’re a fan of Derek Sivers who I’ve known I think since 2007, amazing entrepreneur. People can look him up. I’ll give the one-liner, which is sort of this philosopher king programmer entrepreneur who started companies, gave the vast majority to a charitable trust to fund musical education. At one point, he was the ringleader in a traveling circus, played guitar and sang at a pig state fair, and has just crafted the most unusual and Derek life for himself and given his family permission to do the same for themselves. Really a true, original thinker who also shows it in his actions and this is where I’m going. Derek has this line. I may be paraphrasing it slightly, but the gist is “If more information were the answer, we’d all be billionaires with six pack abs.” What do you see or surmise about people who make the leap from listening to your podcast about all of these icons and people who have not just once you’re lucky, twice you’re good, but in some cases they built $8 billion companies? In that case, I might come back to the acquisition kind of roll-up archetype. The people who make the leap from ingesting information to actually implementing and those who don’t, what’s the missing piece in the middle? David Senra: The way I think about it, the maxim I’ve made for myself on this is learning is not memorizing information. Learning is changing your behavior. If you didn’t change your behavior, this is just all mental gymnastics for you. You’re just wasting your time. What I’m trying to do, I didn’t even understand what I was doing. I had to have, as happens in many cases, somebody outside of you seeing what you’re doing actually gives you what this whole thing is about. I have a good friend of mine. His name’s Jeremy Gafan and he’s really quick-witted and he has a way to condense ideas really well. We’re just walking around taking a walk in Miami Beach one day and he’s like, “Oh, yeah, it’s pretty obvious what this whole thing is.” I didn’t even think he was thinking about it. I was like, “What do you mean?” He’s just like, “Oh, you never had any positive influences. You didn’t have any mentors. If you take somebody like you who’s like psychopathically driven and really has an obsessive personality, that’s what this whole thing is. You’re just reading book after book after book to try to find the path, to try to find the answer, to try to find the way out.” I felt like naked when he said this. I’m like, “I think he’s right. I think he’s right.” For me, I’m definitely not just reading. I’ve been taking all these ideas. The unfair advantage I have is I have one-sided conversations with history’s greatest entrepreneurs. Every week I sit down and read another biography. Then, because I like to talk, this is good because I have to shut up. I can only listen because this is what I think it is. That’s what I think reading a biography is. It’s like one-sided conversation. Then, I take that and I would be doing this even if I didn’t record it, but then sitting down once a week and condensing my thoughts and reacting to it turns it to an act of service. Then, I take the ideas. I’m like, “Oh, that’s a good idea.” I’ll take that and apply it to my business, which is the podcast. It keeps getting better and better. I’m just like, “Oh, these ideas work so I’ll keep doing this.” Then, now what has happened is the people that are trying to be great have studied great people that came before them throughout human history. Caesar was studying Alexander and Steve Jobs was studying Edwin Land and Edwin Land was studying Alexander Graham Bell. If you’re interested in American entrepreneurship, it all kind of goes back to Benjamin Franklin. Everybody looks backwards like, “That guy or that woman was great. How did they do that?” That is an enduring part of human nature that will never change. It’s going to happen while we’re alive. It’s going to happen 1,000 years from now. What I didn’t understand what I was doing is that you put it out into the world just like your work. It’s like a tuning fork, right? It’s like then the people that are really great also do this and they have a deep love of history. If you look at the people that I’ve been talking to from the new show that’s not even released yet, they came because they’re fans. They’re in the audience and it’s just like the para social relationship people have with podcasts. I’m close to the people at Spotify. I’ve been to Stockholm twice in the last six months and I was talking to the head of business at Spotify. His name’s Alex and we were talking for two and a half hours like pretty animated. I was like, “I’m not building a media company. I’m building relationships at scale.” He’s like, “What? Say that again?” I go, “What a podcast is is building relationships to scale.” This is the first time we’ve ever met. Now we should talk about how I found you, but literally I found you on MySpace. I’m going to tell you that. Tim Ferriss: My God. David Senra: The reason, and we’ll go to the influence that you played on having Founders, but I know who you are. We could sit down and talk for eight hours because I know you. There’s no possible way I can consume all of your books and, I don’t know, 600 hours of your podcast and not know Tim. You can’t act for that long. What I didn’t understand is like this other path of me trying to find good information, valuable information. I came from a family. Everybody’s like, “Oh, I’m the first to graduate college.” That’s nice. No one even graduated high school in my family. There’s no reading. There’s no self-improvement. The only thing my family read is the Bible and that can be taken to a crazy extreme. Tim Ferriss: You also didn’t go to prison. David Senra: Exactly. My grandfather, I shouldn’t even say this publicly anymore. You have a big podcast. I would say stuff on small podcasts and forget that things get bigger later on. I say crazy stuff that I should not be saying, but whatever. We’re too late now. My grandfather, my father, my brother, I remember being in high school and hearing “bang.” Five guys at 5:30 in the morning come and grab my brother and I don’t see him for a few years. That’s a fact. My point being is then I’m like, “Oh, wait.” I put this podcast out. Then, it attracts the same people that are in the books and then the fact that I could spend five hours with Michael Dell and he tweets about the podcast and he LinkedIns about it and just giving me phenomenal advice. Then, obviously we record our conversation, but before that they just want to help you because they got value from that. Tim Ferriss: Let me pause you for one second just because I want to go back to the note-taking and then converting that into some type of action. You’ve done that. You’re hitting, and you’ve had a number of these, but inflection points where now you can sit down with some of these icons and have these extended conversations. Even if you did not have that direct access, maybe your process with the note-taking wouldn’t change. I’m just curious how you read one biography or multiple biographies on a person and what the actual note-taking process looks like. I’ll volunteer what I do a lot. I use Kindle not for the convenience of the device, although that is convenient, not because I can listen on Audible or actually do it through the Kindle app and then stop and highlight things, which is also why I use it. The highlighting overall is the reason and then exporting or using something like Readwise in addition to synthesizing my highlights. I believe you also use Readwise quite a bit. I’m not sure if you still use it, but what does your process look like? I know, for instance, like Maria Popova who’s this voluminous, prodigious, genius of a writer, it used to be Brain Pickings. It’s The Marginalian now. She has a very particular process for synthesizing and putting everything together. How do you do that? David Senra: I actually think I’m going to sit down and make an episode about how I make these because I think it’s actually an older idea here that I just went through when I reread James Dyson’s autobiography. Both of them actually, but the first autobiography I’ve read like five times. The second one, I think this is the second or third time I read it. One of the genius things that he did when no one knew who he was, Dyson wasn’t a thing. Now it’s one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world. You walk into a retail store. He had one product in one market at the time and you say, “I’m going to buy a vacuum cleaner.” Five of them kind of look the same and then you have this alien-looking thing at the end. Then, what he said, he’s like, “Hey, what is the advantage I have? I’m going against all these huge multinational conglomerates and I’m just some bloke that cares about vacuum cleaners in this remote part of England.” He convinced all the retailers to let him write a story on a little leaflet and they would hang it on the handle of the Dyson. It tells a story. It’s in 200 or 300 words of who made it, why they made it, why they love it so much, and why you should buy it. People buy stories. That’s what I was saying. It’s like that’s not the first time I came across that idea. You go back to the early 1900s and there’s this guy named Claude Hopkins. I am always interested. You are — Tim Ferriss: I read — David Senra: Scientific Advertising? Tim Ferriss: Yes, in the very beginning. David Senra: I’m always interested in who influences the influencers, right? Let me give you an example. Tim Ferriss: God, I haven’t thought of that name in so many years. David Senra: I have so much shit on this guy. Tim Ferriss: Claude Hopkins. David Senra: I became obsessed. We were talking before we recorded that we both really, I won’t speak for you, love and admire, and mine is borderline idolize, Charlie Munger. If I can only learn from one person for the rest of my life, if you could say, “Hey, you can only read this guy’s words. Pick one person,” I’m picking Munger. I just love everything about him and the idea that I got to meet him is insane, absolutely insane. When I’m reading about Munger and Buffett I’m like, “Man, these guys are really genius.” I didn’t know anything at this time. It’s like 10 years ago and I’m like, “These guys are genius.” Then, they kept mentioning this guy named Henry Singleton over and over again and they will tell you. If you admire somebody, what I think is hugely important, go. They will tell you who influenced them and then you have to go and read about these people. Then, you’ll find who influenced them and you realize that the ideas didn’t start with them. They don’t start with us. They can’t die with us either. You have to push them forward down the generations. I’m like, “Oh, this guy’s interesting. Charlie Munger said that the smartest person he ever met was Henry Singleton. He’s best friends with Buffett. Buffett’s obviously, how did he say that?” Then, Buffett says that it’s a crime that business schools don’t study Singleton. That’s hell of language. That’s — Tim Ferriss: Strong language. David Senra: Strong language, and then you start reading. I’m like, “Oh, my God, the ideas that I thought were Buffett and Munger’s were Singleton’s.” You see this over and over again. I was obsessed. Another guy that Buffett introduced me to was David Ogilvy. David Ogilvy I think is one of the best writers I’ve ever come across and Buffett keeps mentioning this to shareholders. He’s like, “This genius named David Ogilvy.” Why is Buffett calling this guy a genius? Who is this guy? Tim Ferriss: I read Ogilvy’s stuff at the same time that I read Hopkins. David Senra: If you read Ogilvy, what does he talk about? He’s like, “That’s the genius. I’m not the genius. I’m just regurgitating Claude Hopkins’s work.” Then, he tells the story of Albert Lasker who made more money. There’s all these, let’s call them a dozen great advertising agency founders, the Mad Men era. The one that made the most money was this guy named Albert Lasker and he had the simplest business, no art department, no research department. He had Claude Hopkins writing copy and his words rang the cash register. If you can bring more customers to businesses, they will pay you a lot of money and it turns out Claude Hopkins wrote this book called Scientific Advertising. He would try to publish it. It was essentially the secrets of Lasker and Lasker hid it in a safe for 20 years. Tim Ferriss: I’ll get that right over to the agent. Stick that in the safe. David Senra: If you read this, he’s like, “Hey, it may be boring to you.” He uses an example of Schlitz Beer, right? They were fifth in the market share and they hire Hopkins. They’re like, “We want to sell more beer.” He’s like, “Okay.” He does the same thing he does. He does a lot of research and he goes and he tours their distillery. He’s blown away by like that we triple distill the water and I don’t know how beer is made. I don’t even drink that much, but he explains the entire process. Claude’s like, “This is amazing. Why don’t you guys talk about this?” He goes, “Because our process isn’t different than any other distillery.” He goes, “Yeah, but no one’s telling that story.” He writes these huge, essentially 1,500 words, 2,000 words of this is how the beer that you’re about to drink is made and goes from fifth to first because people buy stories. To answer your question, I think what I should do is sit down. Maybe I’ll just clip this and be like, “Okay, this is how I make the podcast or how I consume information.” I think me and you share a love of the writing of Cormac McCarthy. Tim Ferriss: Sure, my God. David Senra: He said — Tim Ferriss: Beautiful and brutal in equal measure. David Senra: Yes, he said something that’s fascinating where he — Tim Ferriss: The Road, Blood Meridian, I mean there are many other examples. David Senra: All The Pretty Horses, The Border Trilogy, just everything the guy just read everything. He’s just incredible. The Road, No Country for Old Men. I saw the movie before I saw the book. It’s crazy how they barely had to change any words. It’s like he wrote a script, so he said something that was fascinating, that subconscious is older than language. And they’re like, “How’d you write Blood Meridian?” He goes, “I didn’t.” He’s like, “I sat there and it came all from my subconscious. I eliminated anything that got in the way of it.” Right? Tim Ferriss: And you must have a busy therapist. David Senra: I couldn’t imagine within that guy’s head to write that book. The Judge. The Judge is the craziest — Tim Ferriss: Really dark. So dark. Anyway. David Senra: So anyways, so I am all intuition, all feeling. So basically what I do is I sit down with a book and usually, I do this physically and it’s like I’m doing arts and crafts over here. I sit down with a physical book because that’s how I fell in love with reading. I don’t have memories before I had love of reading and I think one of the best things that ever happened to me is the fact that I don’t know why reading grabbed a hold of me since I was four or five years old. So my mom was dying of breast cancer. What I said about the only thing they read is the Bible that you could take that to an extreme because she tried for two years. She tried to pray her cancer away. And by that time, by the time we convinced her to see an oncologist, the word he used was the horses out of the barn. And this is the most grueling way to die when it spreads to your bones. It’s just like that happens. I’m calling you to put a pillow over my face. I’m just not going through that. It was just a terrible thing to see. But one of the thing she said, she’s like, you’ve just been like this forever. You were a kid and you’d read the back of cereal boxes. I’d walk in every single room. I did this when I come in here and just automatically read everything that’s on the walls. So I have no idea where this came from. I didn’t choose the passion of reading. It chose me. And all of it is intuition. I sit down with a physical book, that’s how I fell in love with reading. I sit down with pen. Tim Ferriss: Your mom would bring you to the bookstore, right? David Senra: Yes. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They won’t kick you out for reading. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. And the library. And then I remember the first time it was like this maybe before I even knew words because I was obsessed with Where’s Waldo. So it was my first memory. So you’re not reading anything, you’re just finding the guy with the striped shirt or a striped sweater. So basically I sit down with a book, physical book, pen, six-inch ruler, Post-it notes, and scissors. And I just read and I don’t think, and if something jumps out to me, I highlight it, and then whatever pops to my mind. And normally as our mutual friends like Patrick, Chris, Rick, they’ll all see this. It’s just like I’m not actually listening to what you’re saying. There’s an idea behind it. Tim Ferriss: Meaning you’re not taking what the author says literally. You’re looking at the idea behind — David Senra: I’m just looking for the essence. So if me and Rick are talking about a giant deal that he wants to invest in, I’m thinking about how that’s similar to how Fred Smith built FedEx or how Jim Casey built UPS or how Buffett thought about buying See’s Candy. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do with the Post-it notes and the scissors and the ruler? David Senra: So basically, I underline that sentence and then whatever popped in my mind and I’m like, oh, this is kind of like James J. Hill when he was building the only profitable successful American railroad and you just write down whatever comes to mind. Tim Ferriss: On the Post-it? David Senra: On the Post-it. Tim Ferriss: And that goes on the page. David Senra: It goes on the page. David Senra: So then I’m writing it down and then I might have three sentences, but the Post-it note’s three by five, so I have to cut it. It has to be clean, it has to look good. There’s a beauty to it. I am irrational, crazy when it comes to this stuff. This is why I think I picked up on your work right away. I see a fellow nutcase and obsessive we’re like, I hand edit, now, my transcripts. So everybody’s like, “You should outsource it to AI. You should outsource it to India.” No, I have to touch it. I have to feel it. I just love it. I’m not doing it to do it quicker. I like what Jerry Seinfeld says. “The hard way is the right way.” I like the hard way. This also goes back to obviously have some kind of dark thing driving me, which we can dive into if you want. So then you go through the entire book and so then I have to take pictures of it into the Readwise app because you do it the smarter way. Kindle will just automatically go to Readwise. Tim Ferriss: Well, I still use physical. I’ll explain. I can trade. I’ll tell you how I use physical. David Senra: You want to go do it now, or you want — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Well, okay, so don’t lose your place. David Senra: I won’t. Tim Ferriss: All right, you got the scissors. I want to know about the ruler. Oh, I guess the ruler. David Senra: Straight lines. It has to be straight. It has to be beautiful. Tim Ferriss: So we both have pretty moderate to severe OCD. I remember when I was diagnosed by the psychiatrist who was doing some preliminary formality of taking me through these assessments before I was going to have this experimental brain stimulation, “Send me experimental.” And he had to check the boxes and went through these hours and hours of stuff and he’s like, “Why don’t you to take a seat? If we need to take a break, I understand.” And he gave me this OCD diagnosis. I’m like, “Yeah, what else is new? Keep going.” David Senra: “I knew this about myself.” Tim Ferriss: “Yeah, I don’t need time.” The way I use physical, and I do use physical still quite a bit, is I will, and this is another question that maybe you can answer when you pick back up is how a second or third reading differs from the first. Because when I read it the first time, I’m doing something very similar to you. I’m underlining things or if that’s just too much work, the book is actually a gem and it has a lot. Then I will just bracket it on the side of the paragraph so that I know what the highlight is. Then I will go through, if I read it a second time, and I will put T2 in a circle next to the things that still stuck out on a second reading. Now sometimes you’re just a different person if you read it five years later and your lived experience and your position is life is different. But if I’m doing it in somewhat rapid succession, I want to see what sticks on a second or third reading. So you’ll see T2, T3, etc. Sometimes, it’s just fun to see how I change over time with The Moral Letters to Lucilius by Seneca the Younger — people can find it in all sorts of compendiums. I put out a free PDF called The Tao of Seneca. I like to just see where I am at different points in my life, what resonates. And then, typically with any physical book I’m creating, I just did this with a book I finished yesterday called Deep Tech by Pablos Holman where I’m creating an index in the front. So whenever there’s a page that really, really sticks out, I’ll write down like 168, whatever it might be. Someone I want to look up, someone like a Claude Hopkins, whose name gets dropped and I’m like, that seems important. All right. And so I have this index and then I’ll take a photograph of the index just in case I lose the book, which has happened. And that’s always painful. I also will have, I’ll make a little box on the bottom right-hand corner of some of the front matter pages and I’ll put next steps there. David Senra: Wait, what’s the front matter? Tim Ferriss: So the front matter would be the copyright page, the title page, the pages that don’t really have any content on them. Maybe there’s the dedication page like ‘To Mom’, it’s like, okay, that’s a blank page that I can use. So on the bottom right-hand corner, just two lines that create sort a box, I’ll write down next steps. So for every book, not every book, in some cases if it’s just for pleasure and it’s fiction, but even then sometimes ideas will pop into mind. I’ll be like, okay, what is at least one kind of next step? Maybe it’s looking up someone like Claude Hopkins. Maybe it’s an action, maybe it’s a phone call, maybe it’s an email. But along the lines of David Allen and Getting Things Done, it’s like one physical next action. And so I almost always have that in nonfiction books. So that’s photos. I take photos of all that. I used to put it all into Evernote. I still sometimes do that because I’ve been using it forever and I have thousands of them. But you’re the last Evernote standing. I might be, yeah, I use scannable to get it into Evernote, but the point is I have a way to then OCR it so I can search it. All right, back to — David Senra: So that’s basically what I have to do now, which takes an unbelievable amount of time. But again, then now, so I’ve already read it one time. Now I have to input it into Readwise, right? So you take a picture of it and it’s laborious and now I’ve read it for the second or maybe a third time. Then you see on page and then you have to make sure that it matches up between the page and what’s on your screen. And so you’re reading it over and over again. So then I get it all into Readwise, then I will go back — Tim Ferriss: Do you want to take a sidebar just to explain what Readwise is? David Senra: Readwise is essentially just a way to keep track of your notes and highlights from everything you read. And now they’re expanding out because it turns out the total just on the market for people that want to keep highlights and notes, first of all, how many people are reading books now? That number is dwindling unfortunately. And then of that subset of smaller and dwindling people, how many read as much as you and I do? And then they want to actually research essentially giant, searchable database of everything you’ve ever read. It’s super valuable and they charge like $99 a year for it. So now basically they were running this for six years. They have a new web reader app and they said they made more money in six months from that than they didn’t Readwise for six years. This is obviously not a lot of people that want to do this. The thing that we’re describing doing. So then I used to read the physical book because actually let’s back up and I want to tell you the role that you played. And don’t let me forget where I’m at though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I won’t. David Senra: So I went to a shitty college because I remember when I was in your senior year, I went to public high school and everybody’s like, “Where are you going to school?” And I didn’t understand what they meant. I’m like, “The one I can drive to, the one I can go to at night because I have to work during the day. I don’t know where you’re talking about.” I didn’t know. I got kicked out of my house when I was 18 and I had to live in student housing. Tim Ferriss: Why did you get kicked out? David Senra: My mom’s side of the family has severe mental illness and just some of the worst people you’ve ever met. And they just had this belief that you kick your kids out when you’re 18, it’s just like — Tim Ferriss: Out of the nest. David Senra: It is not even that. It’s like they pick a fake fight and you have somebody that’s very, I’m not, that was the point of contention between my mom is she had undiagnosed mental illness for sure, maybe not schizophrenic, definitely bipolar. Her sister was schizophrenic. And listen man, as you get older, at the time I had a lot of anger, super, a lot of anger, didn’t understand why they’re doing what you’re doing and then you get older and then you have your own kids. So I went through this crazy thing where I think I hated them even more because when my daughter was born, I’m like, I remember seeing her for the first time. I was like, you think you love a woman? No. Enzo Ferrari has this great line that “It’s impossible for a man to love a woman. The only true love he has is for his kids.” And I understand what he meant. I think Ryan Reynolds said it best where it’s like “I never thought I’d love anybody as much as I love Blake Lively. And then she gave birth to our daughter and as soon as I looked at her daughter, I knew if we were ever under attack, I would use Blake as a human shield to protect that baby.” It’s funny, but it’s literally when I heard him say that, I go, “Yes.” Tim Ferriss: Right. David Senra: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: So that makes the memory all the more painful. David Senra: Then I was like, how did you do this to your children? And then you get — there’s another — you get more experience and then you’re like, yes, but imagine you grew up like they did, poor white trash. My grandfather raped all his daughters, including my mothers. Raped all of his daughters, raped his gr — I didn’t know about this until after he died or else I would’ve been the one to put them in his grave, raped his daughters, raped his granddaughters. They lived in this shitty house in Indiana with one bathroom that was in — there was two-bedroom, she had three sisters. The only bathroom is in my gr — I call them grandparents. I hate them with all of my being in their room. And so if you wanted to go in the bedroom at night, he was a monster. They would urinate in cups and pour it out the window. So again, it doesn’t excuse the bad decisions that they made and the unhappy marriage my parents had and all this other crap. It was just like, “All right, imagine that. Imagine that. You destroyed your kids. That person was supposed to protect them and I can’t even talk about this.” So anyways, we would fight a lot and she’d be alternate depending on the day, she’d be the kindest person in the world or a storm. And so the unfortunate part was when she got diagnosed with cancer, we hadn’t spoken for six months, so she only survived another, I think, two years. So that means the last two and a half years I missed — what? That’s 20 percent, 25 percent of her life. And somebody’s like, “What were you guys fighting over?” I was like, “The sad thing is I don’t remember.” But I was not one to let, I was very hardheaded. And so she had some weird fight with me. I don’t remember what it was. And then she was like, “You’re not allowed to live here.” Kicked me out, I didn’t have anything. So anyways, I went to, I lived in student housing and that was the first time — they randomly assign you a roommate and it was like the son of a rich rancher because our fridge was full of all this meat stuff, which is bad because it was the summer where Florida got hit by four hurricanes and all the meat went rotting. Tim Ferriss: Spoiled. David Senra: Oh, yes, it was disgusting, but I didn’t know that there were people legitimately, this makes me sound like an absolute moron, but I didn’t know that there were people that only went to college because my roommate didn’t have a job. He just drank and went to — I’m like, “What else do you do?” He was like, “What?” This is crazy. So I don’t know where I was going with that. Tim Ferriss: You were taking a pause on Readwise and multiple reads and you’re like, “I’ve got to tell you how I found you.” David Senra: Oh, okay. So again, I’m in a crappy school. It’s a state school in Orlando, UCF. I almost said UFC where it’s MMA. That would’ve been probably more useful now. So UCF, and this is when Facebook was coming out, but Facebook was only at the fancy schools. Tim Ferriss: Yes, right. It was very much at the fancy schools. David Senra: We didn’t have Facebook, we had MySpace. And so remember you’d go and there would be music playing on somebody’s profile? Well, people would, they would list their favorite movies and favorite books. And I think I was looking at a girl’s — probably — profile. And under favorite books, it said 4-Hour Workweek. I’m like, that’s a great title, what is that? And I immediately order it on Amazon and then I start reading it, obviously. Then that book inspired, I don’t know, 25 million people, maybe even more, but now and then I start consuming all your stuff. So I’d buy all your books. I bought your TV show. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I appreciate that. David Senra: Sometimes I’ll forget because you go on like — whatever, it’s not called iTunes anymore. And I don’t buy anything because everything streams. I’m like Tim Ferriss, [inaudible]. Tim Ferriss: I know from the Natural History Museum back in the day. David Senra: So I was obsessed with podcasts, I discovered in 2010, and before I started mine in 2016, I listened to thousands of them. And you had one that changed my life, which was when you did Jocko. And that was 2015 if I remember correctly. And you told him to start a podcast and I think Rogan told him to do it as well. And he’s like, well, if I got these two guys, obviously he’s smart. Just take the advice. And I started listening to his podcast and he changed format. But in the beginning it was just him doing, he would read a first-person account, so an autobiography of somebody in combat and I could not believe what I was hearing. And so what I would do is I’d listen maybe a hundred of the books or I listen to a hundred of his episodes and maybe buy a dozen of the books. So you learn, even on the episodes, you don’t read the book, you learn so much and you’re inspired. And in the books, he kept introducing me all kinds of crazy stories and I was like, Hey. A couple months later then obviously I had started reading biographies because your friend Kevin Rose did this excellent interview with Elon Musk, we can talk about from 2012. And I was like, what if I do Jocko’s format, but I’m interested in four things. I’m interested in reading, history, podcasts, and entrepreneurship. And so if you look at it’s like it just sits in between those four. And I started doing that and essentially I was just imitating Jocko and no one gave a shit for five and a half years. Tim Ferriss: Yes. Wow. What a wild story. So I want to dive into that. The interview with Jocko, I owe special thanks to, I think it was Peter Attia — David Senra: He was. Tim Ferriss: Who made the introduction. David Senra: He said, just trust me on this. Tim Ferriss: And — David Senra: Then didn’t he just show up at your house or something? Tim Ferriss: Yes, we hung out in San Francisco. I remember exactly which coffee shop we went to. And I made the mistake. I wasn’t even thinking properly. I had a camo shirt on and I was like, I can’t believe I wore a fucking camo shirt to meet someone as legitimate as Jocko Willink. And I was just like, oh, facepalm. But we ended up connecting. That was his first ever public interview, which is wild. David Senra: One of the best ones ever done. Tim Ferriss: Oh. I mean he really brought the heat as Jocko — David Senra: He’s my alarm every morning. He’s like, “Get up.” I swear to God, I’m not joking. He’s been my alarm for half a decade. He yells at me. I’m like, “You’re right.” Tim Ferriss: Yes, Extreme Ownership still highly, highly, highly recommend to everyone. And if you want to hear me and Jocko go toe to toe, not really toe to toe, we’re sort of shoulder to shoulder with a book we did Musashi. David Senra: Episode 100. Tim Ferriss: Episode 100, which was like four and a half, five hours long going through this historical novel about the most famous swordsman in Japanese history. David Senra: I read that because of that episode. Tim Ferriss: Oh, so good. David Senra: I think I read the audiobook first. It’s 60 hours long or something. Tim Ferriss: It’s really long. And keeping in mind, this was originally published in Japanese in a country of whatever the population is like 120, 150 million. I think it sold 80 to a hundred million copies. I mean something just completely insane. And who knows, I might be getting that off, but the numbers are just astonishing as a ratio of the total population. So five and a half years, how do you explain no one giving a shit for five and a half years? In other words, was there something that happened, a decision you made, something that changed things around the five and a half year mark? Was it a change in technology? David Senra: Oh, change in business model. Tim Ferriss: What happened? Yes. David Senra: Literally I was doing nothing different, changing business model. So you remember podcasting back in there, because you were one of the OGs and you had this massive audience. Your blog was crazy. You were huge and still are. And I was none of those things. I was a weird introvert. I didn’t have any social media, I didn’t know anything about the internet. I don’t know how to describe. I just would like to read and record a podcast in my kitchen on a hundred-dollar microphone. And I remember calling around and trying to figure out what’s the business model here? And everybody was like, “Oh, it’s ads.” I’m like, “Oh, that’s great.” And so at the time there was these ad networks, essentially they just sell ads for you and they’re like, we’d love to work with you, you just have to have 50,000 downloads per show. And I go, “What? I will never! 50,000?” It seemed like such a big number. “That will never ever happen.” Tim Ferriss: In the universe of podcasts, it’s still a big number. David Senra: Yes, but now there’s a million. Think about how many people listen to The Tim Ferriss Show and there’s millions and millions and millions of people over the course of a year or whatever. So I was like, “Oh, my God, that’s never going to happen.” And so then you’d say, “Okay, well, what can you do?” And back then it’d be affiliate. So remember, Audible scaled massively. People don’t realize how big businesses can get on the back of podcasts, and how many have. Audible was, it was on every — Dan Carlin had one ad and it was an Audible ad. Tim Ferriss: It was Audible. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: They were very smart about that. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yes. They’ve been able to change a lot of their economics — David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: For the better, for Audible and Amazon since capturing more market share. But they did an excellent job of marketing and advertising. David Senra: They were on every single podcast. And so I did that. And then there was this company called Blinkist, which was a — Tim Ferriss: Summaries? David Senra: Summary, 10-minute summary app for business books, non-fiction books. And that blew my mind because so you only got paid on sales and they would show you not the people, but where the country was. And I remember the first time somebody in Japan bought, I’m like, I’m sitting in Miami in my kitchen, “Great acoustics, by the way, you idiot.” On a hundred-dollar mic with no pop filter, no nothing. There was nothing out there, there was no — editing a podcast now with the script and all the AI tools, it’s like magic compared to what we had to do back then. And I was like, what? Somebody in Japan listened to this thing? This was crazy. So the one idea I had, there is this, I actually got the business model from a socialist podcast. Tim Ferriss: Might’ve been the beginning of the troubles. David Senra: So there was this, for a long time when I opened a browser, my homepage would be this thing called Graphtreon. Graphtreon is essentially they use the Patreon API and you see people building membership communities. And what was interesting about them is people sell comic books, they would sell podcasts, they would sell newsletters, videos, and the most popular category was podcasts. I’m like, that’s weird. And so at the time, this podcast called Chapo Trap House was the number one and they had 25,000 people. Tim Ferriss: Thing is on Patreon. David Senra: Yes. And the only way you see this is because Graphtreon would aggregate the data for you and present it to you. And so, at the time, I think they had 20,000 paid subscribers, at least $5 a month. And their business model is simple. Every other podcast you have to pay for, so you can listen to half them for free. If you want more, just pay five bucks a month and you can listen to it in a podcast player. Like anything else, you just have to go through the paywall. And every month I’m watching and the number gets higher and higher and higher. Now if you pull up Graphtreon, I think the number one is Shane Gillis, I think he’s got 120,000 paid subscribers. So I was like, oh, there’s like a business here with what if I had a subscription podcast? So it’s one thing to pay five bucks a month for a comedy podcast, but my podcasts are about business. If there’s ideas on this podcast that will make people more money, which is essentially what business education comes down to, you want to be more successful at what you do, there’s some kind of, hopefully you see a better economic outcome for yourself and your family. I was like, what if I could just sell subscriptions? Because I’m not selling enough Audible subscriptions and Blinkist, that’s not going to happen. And my idea was, I think I was completely in love with podcasting and still am. It’s the only thing I think about. I work on seven days a week. It’s completely taken over my life. And my idea was I don’t even have to be wealthy, I just have to do this for a living. It has to come out of me. It’s like I had no control over this. And I was like, maybe I can make dentist money. So my idea was like, I bet you I can sell 3,000 paid subscriptions at a hundred dollars a pop, make 300 grand a year. And then I also have a lot of self-confidence like, well, if I could sell 3,000, I could sell 20,000, and then maybe I can sell as many as Chapo can and then I’m making two million. This is the idea I had. And so my idea was the genius idea I had was like, “Hey, your most valuable asset you have, which is your podcasts, they are easy to share and everything else, let’s put a big wall in front of that.” And so I put a giant paywall in front of it and obviously it slows growth because how are you going to share the episode? And the one benefit I had, which really kept me going, and I don’t think I would’ve quit anyways, I really don’t think I had any other option, but was that we don’t know who’s going to listen to this one. We just see numbers on the screen. But with a subscription, you see the email address and the emails were the top founders and top VCs and I had a very small audience and one of them was our mutual friend, Patrick O’Shaughnessy. And I was a huge fan of Patrick. And I saw, I’m not going to repeat his email address here, but I know what the, I was like, I saw that come across and there were so few, I saw every single one. You’re getting like 10 a day, I don’t know, five a day or something like that paid. And I’m like, oh, my God, Patrick bought one. He didn’t know who I was. He didn’t know I was a big fan of his, didn’t know anything. I had no followers. I think I had 7,000 followers across all, every one of my accounts. And I was trying really hard back then. And he goes, “I never find good podcasts to listen to. I think David Senra’s Founders podcast is excellent. You should listen to it.” And he linked to that one and Estée Lauder and I could not believe it. Because I was like, why do I have these mentions on Twitter? What is a mention? I don’t get mentions. What is this new thing? And then I log into my email and it’s just because back then you would get an email every time you get a new pay subscription and off of one tweet of an endorsement by people. This is why you and Andrew are kind of like the male Oprah. And I mean that in the — you know how much shit I’ve bought because you told me that it’s good. Why? Because of the trust that, people chase numbers. It’s like that. You’re not chasing numbers, you’re chasing trust and relationships. I love what Warren Buffett said: “A brand is a promise.” The fact that you guys have such high standards, I’ve never bought anything like what the hell was Tim thinking? And so that’s what makes you so valuable. So Patrick extended that trust to me where I logged into my email and you couldn’t stop scrolling. You couldn’t stop scrolling. And so I screenshotted that because — Tim Ferriss: Patrick’s a good dude. Very smart too. Invest Like the Best. David Senra: Yes. You did an excellent episode with him for when you hit your 10-year anniversary. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yes. 10 years.David Senra: And then I was a huge NBA fan and the person that found me, that’s been really, really helpful. When I had 1,500 listeners, guy named Sam Hinkie, former general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, very, very intelligent, intense, and kind of reclusive guy. Now he’s really hard to get to. And we had talked a bunch and he’s just like, “I really think you have something here. I think you’re — what you’re doing is important and I’ve tried to help you as much as I can.” And I knew him and Patrick were friends, and I screenshotted Patrick’s tweet. I was like, “Look what your friend Patrick did.” Sam didn’t say anything. He just put it, and again, Patrick trusts Sam and Sam’s telling Patrick, “This guy’s worth your time.” He put us in group chat. He goes, “You two need to know each other.” And I was like, “Patrick, I’m a huge fan. Love to talk to you.” And Patrick doesn’t have a calendar. So he’s like, “What about right now?” And I was like, “Well, let me look at my calendar.” Nothing. Nothing. Literally nothing. I was like, “Yes.” We talked for the first, first time we talked was an hour and a half. And we get to the end, he goes, “I thought I was in the podcast.” And then we become friends. And then I joined his network and then he just poured gasoline on a promising spark. Tim Ferriss: Was he the one who convinced you to remove the wall? Or how did you end up — David Senra: No. So a friend of mine, again, this is the sad part about becoming, getting more following is so many of my close friends now came from DMs. And now you can’t do that. You can’t even look at mentions. Tim Ferriss: Yes. David Senra: I’d be curious. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t work. David Senra: Yes, it’s it kind of rule. It’s such a magical thing. And now because, Tim Ferriss: Yes, well once verified could be purchased, it destroyed the utility of meeting those people on. David Senra: It’s like what Charlie Munger said, if you have a bunch of raisins in just a few turds, you still got turds and you could have 99 percent of the people are nice to you. And then it’s these psychos and you’re like, I can’t read my mentions anymore. Can’t check my DMs. It’s sad.But one of, I met a couple friends through them and again, I was grinding out hundred-dollar-year subscriptions, just like going to the factory every day trying to sell a few more. And one of my friends told me what one of his friends’ company just paid to advertise on one of the biggest business podcasts. And the number was like, what, what did you just say? And then Sam and other people like Patrick, they’re just like, “This is weird thing that you’re doing. Why don’t you just sell ads like everybody else?” And I was like, “Look at China. They’re 90 percent subscription to your podcast.” Like, “Yeah, but you’re American, you idiot.” And so I came up with all these crazy, because I can be very convincing in the opposite direction. It doesn’t have to be a good idea, I can talk myself into good ideas, but I can talk myself into bad ideas too. And so eventually I called Patrick one day and I was just like, “Man, I am fighting with one hand behind my back. This is really, really difficult. I think I’m going to make an ad based version of Founders.” He’s like, “Yeah, no shit. I’ve been telling you to do this forever.” And then I was like, “And I’d like it to be on your network.” And he’s like, “Ooh, that’s interesting.” And again, he’s just a good dude, and he’s like, “Yeah, but I own all podcasts on my network. Will you sell me equity?” And I don’t know why I said this, and I was like, “No.” It was crazy, and I’d had all these acquisition investment offers up until that point, because obviously everybody in the audience likes to do deals, so they like trying to allocate capital. Tim Ferriss: That’s their sport. David Senra: Yeah, and I was like, “No, no, no.” It wasn’t a business thing to me, it’s like a special thing. It’s like part of my soul. Michael Dell has this great answer when he was fighting with Carl Icahn when, and they’re like, “Why don’t you just start another company?” And he’s like, “I like this company. First of all, it has my name on it,” and he goes, “I’m going to care about this company after I’m dead.” So that’s how I feel, it’s a rational love that I have for this. And so I was like, “I don’t want to sell equity, but.” He’s like, “What do you want?” I was like, “I want you to help amplify my audience and connect me with first-rate advertisers. Then we could just share ad revenue.” And one call he’s like, “Done.” That completely changed everything. That was four years ago. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Thank God for Patrick, huh? David Senra: Oh, for sure. I talk to him almost every day. We’re like brothers, I called him this morning. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. He’s a very, very good guy. Tim Ferriss: Well, let’s just, actually, I’m going to zoom into your expertise, subject matter for a second, and then I want to talk more about podcasting, but just so it doesn’t become too much inside baseball, I do want to come back and talk about podcasting. But you have mentioned a number of different names at the top of your list, people to learn from. Where does Edwin Land fit into that, and who is Edwin Land? David Senra: Edwin Land is the patron saint of Founders. I want a picture of him in my house like The Last Supper, it would just be Edwin Land in the middle like Jesus. Again, I’m very interested in who influences the influencers, and where do these ideas actually come from? And Steve Jobs, if you have a Mount Rushmore of greatest entrepreneurs, his face has got to be on it, undoubtedly. He created the most successful product in history. I think he did it for the right reasons. I think he’s a very fascinating person, obviously incredibly flawed as a human, which he even said. But what’s fascinating is if you go back, and which I do, is when I read a biography of somebody, I will make a list going back to your outline of what I’ll do in the front of the books, which you called, what’s? Tim Ferriss: Front matter. David Senra: Front matter. I didn’t even know that term till now, thank you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I will write down all the other founders or all the other people they’ll talk about. And so I just did this with James Dyson. He’s obsessed with Buckminster Fuller and Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Jeremy Fry and Alec Issigonis, and all these people. He just repeats them over and over again and you just realize, oh, he studied these guys and then took their ideas and said, those ideas are good. I’ll use them and then make $60 billion or whatever his company’s worth. Tim Ferriss: Everyone should read about Buckminster Fuller. David Senra: I haven’t read the book yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I’ve read his ideas, but not the book that James read when he was in college. It’s fascinating to me how it’s almost all — and they usually find it early. I had lunch with Sam Zell. I’m talking to him. Tim Ferriss: How did he make his money, for people who don’t know? David Senra: Well, people consider him an investor. He calls himself an entrepreneur. He called himself an entrepreneur. What he’s most well known for is in 2007, he sold, I think the biggest real estate company in history for 38 billion to Blackstone. He tipped at the very top of the market, but he just likes to essentially buy businesses, try to make them grow. He would sell some, so that’s why people consider him an investor. But he considered himself an entrepreneur originally. By the time I met him, he had 61 years of experience as an entrepreneur. And my favorite entrepreneurs are I love talking to these people that have 40, 50, I’m not interested in the startup founder at all. This 25-year-old kid that thinks he’s smart, he doesn’t have enough experience yet. Life is going to teach you what you need. Tim Ferriss: People who’ve ridden many multiple macroeconomic cycles who have had to contend with different challenges at different points in their lives, not just when they have no responsibilities and no dependence, et cetera. David Senra: Well, he says something in his autobiography that you were speaking to earlier. He’s like, “Yeah, earlier in my life, my career fought my marriages and my career won and that’s why I’ve been married three times.” The very current theme is that you look at life as everything that’s not work as an unpleasant distraction, and you wonder why your relationship’s broken because you’re not spending any time there. Of course, that’s the outcome, and they all make this mistake over and over again. So what’s fascinating about this is we’ll go back to Edwin Land in a minute. Sam Zell. In his biography, he’s like, “Dude, I’m in college.” This guy was making millions of dollars a year when he was in law school. That’s how good of an entrepreneur he was from day one. Tim Ferriss: Was that real estate? David Senra: Yeah. He was developing, I think student housing at the time, I think the student housing, but he was also doing deals. He’s just a very gifted deal maker, and you see this with Rick. Understanding, you’ll bring something to Rick and he’ll be like, “Oh, here’s 10 things that are important.” Tim Ferriss: Do you want to explain who Rick is briefly? David Senra: His name is Rick Gerson. He’s one of my closest friends. You’ve known him for what? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know, 15, 20 years, a long time. David Senra: 15, 20 years, he’s one of the most generous, thoughtful, and also simultaneously super intense people I know. Tim Ferriss: He’s a master of finance, came out of this just sort of amazing training environment. We can just call that for what it is for now in simplicity and is one also of the best connected humans I’ve ever met.He identifies, there’s one thing. He learned that from Sam, and then Sam learned that from this guy named Jay Pritzker. It’s very fascinating, so. Tim Ferriss: Chicago royalty. David Senra: Yes, 100 percent. So I actually just backed, it’s not a Kickstarter, but it’s almost like this. There’s no biographies of Jay, and so there’s a guy named Rockwood Notes that essentially put his hat out. He’s like, “Hey, I want to do this, but I need to make at least, I think, 40,000 a year to write this book,” and he’s selling $800 or a thousand dollars a year subscriptions. I was like, “Yeah, I’ll obviously sign up for this. I want a Jay Pritzker biography.” So Sam Zell in his autobiography, he’s like, “Yeah, I read this book by William Zeckendorf and it changed my life because there’s one idea in this book.” It’s what Charlie Munger said, there’s ideas worth billions in a $30 history book. There was this thing called Hawaiian technique. William Zeckendorf was this real estate developer in New York, and he came from nothing and then made a lot of money, then lost it all, and then made a lot of money, then lost it all again and dies with no money, so you want to avoid that too. But he had this thing called the Hawaiian technique, which was, hey, if you just parcel out a building and you sell the different parts to whoever values it more, you’ll make more money. So the lease is valued higher by these guys, and the land is valued higher, and maybe the commercial real estate there or whatever, he just would break it apart like Legos and sell it independently and make a little money. What Sam realized, he started using that real estate and he goes, “Oh, this works in business too.” He’d buy business. It’s like maybe you want the IP, maybe you want the talent, maybe you want the actual physical assets. And he’d do this over and over again. So I remember telling Sam to his face, and Sam had no filter, and he was exactly who you thought he was. If you watched any videos, he’s just like this and I go, “Yeah, I bought that book that you recommended.” He goes, “Did you read it?” I go, “No.” He goes, “Read it,” he’s got the gravelly voice. “Read it.” I was like, “Oh, shit, okay.” And I read it as soon as I went home and started reading it. Sam Zell tells you to read a book, just read a book. But the reason I bring this up is because you’ll see this over and over again. They’ll find somebody early. You can go back and read this Playboy interview just for the, I hope when you, it’s just for the interview. Tim Ferriss: Just for the interview. David Senra: It’s not for anything else, of Steve Jobs when he’s 25, 26, and he’s talking about the fact that we have the wrong role models and heroes as a society. We want to be. Now, he’d say — you want to be YouTubers or something. We want to be athletes. We want to be all these other things. We should want to be Edwin Land. And at the time, Edwin Land was the founder of Polaroid. Edwin Land’s in his seventies. Jobs meets him, spends time with him a bunch of times. Edwin Land at that time had the third most patents of any American in history. I think it was Thomas Edison, the second guy, and then Edwin Land, or maybe it’s the first guy, and then Thomas Edison, but Edwin Land was up there, and what you would realize is when Jobs goes on stage and says, “Hey, I wanted to build Apple. I wanted to build a company at the of liberal arts and technology,” and he has that, he literally puts the street sign up on there. That is literally a direct quote from Edwin Land. Edwin Land wanted to build a company at the intersection of liberal arts and technology. He wanted to make completely vertically integrated consumer products that were magical, that had a magical experience. In Edwin Land’s case, he invented the industry that he then comes to dominate. There was no such thing as instant photography. So when we’re like, how great is the iPhone compared to one that came before it? The difference is vast, but not the same thing as if me and you were hanging out before Edwin Land was on this Earth. We take a picture at a party, “How’d it come out? Well, we’ll find out two weeks from now when we get it back from Kodak.” Tim Ferriss: Turns out it was a shot of my foot. David Senra: As opposed to, “Wait a minute and we’re going to see it right here in the Polaroid.” And then dude, the amount of ideas that Jobs took from him. Go look at the freaking tables that Jobs uses when he gives presentations. The actual table, it’s the same table that Edwin Land gave when he gave presentations. Tim Ferriss: If somebody wants to study Edwin Land, where do they start? David Senra: I read this biography of Edwin Land I thought was incredible. It’s called Insisting on the Impossible. It’s the most comprehensive biography of him. People read it, they’re like, “This book sucks.” I think it’s riveting. There is a book, I think it’s called Land’s Polaroid. That’s the one I’d read because it’s only 250 pages and it’s written by a guy that worked for and with Edwin Land for 20 years. And I love those kinds of things because you see them over a decade. But my point being is Jobs was talking about this guy when he was 25. Jobs knows he’s dying when he’s working with Isaacson on the biography, he knows he’s dying and he’s still talking about Edwin Land appears in Isaacson’s biography of Jobs six times. Why is he still talking about this guy? How could you not be interested in understanding why? What is it about this guy that he admired and liked? Yeah, and he has a saying that, he has a personal motto that I love and that I try to do. And Edwin Land’s, there’s two of them. Edwin Land says, “My personal motto is very personal. It may not apply to anybody else or anybody else or any other company, but is don’t do anything that someone else can do.” The importance of differentiation. I’m shocked at how few people understand how important it is. Dyson, Dyson’s whole thing is it has to be different. Even if it’s worse, it should be different. He demands difference. He’s got a very fascinating business philosophy. Dyson’s mind’s incredible. And then the other thing is he knows because he dropped out of Harvard, he goes, “There’s something they don’t teach you at Harvard Business School, that anything worth doing is worth doing to excess.” Tim Ferriss: So how do you think about different archetypes? Perhaps that’s the best word to use within the pantheon of successful entrepreneurs. The reason I ask that is that I imagine you get questions that along the lines of, and I get questions like this also, when you look across all of the biographies, what are some of the common patterns? Give me the top five, top six, and then people want to grab that recipe. But it could be just to use a sports analogy, it’s like, all right, you’re taking the stretching routine from LeBron James, the weight training routine from Arnold Schwarzenegger and this and this and this. You’re grabbing habits from mutants that are in entirely different spheres where they have different bodies entirely and then trying to cobble it together. It may not work. That’s point number one, probably won’t work. Number two is that within the world of business advice, whether it’s autobiographies, biographies, interviews, there’s a lot that conflicts. So you have one person who says, “Anything that’s worth doing is worth overdoing,” and then you can tell who the novice is because they do too much. And I’m wondering how you think of entrepreneurship for yourself in terms of modeling different people or taking advice because you could have two people, just to use a metric that’s easy for everybody to wrap their head around two billionaires and they give you diametrically opposed advice. How do you personally pick? David Senra: There’s no formula. This is actually something, one of the things I’m so thrilled with is the fact that I’ve become friends with Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, and this is something we’re actually trying to work on together because he brings this up. He’s like, “We need alternative founder archetypes.”And back up, first of all, Daniel is an alien. There is a specific reason that I wanted him to be the very first guest on the new show is I’m able to build relationships with other people. Daniel’s very special in the sense that he’s only a few years older than me, but he’s so much more wiser than I am. I don’t know how I can put this in words, it makes sense, but because he’s founded and is still running a $120 billion company, he’s been running for 19 years, but to me, he’s still so underrated. And the thing about Daniel is not only is he wicked smart, but he’s given me some of the best advice. And he does it in a very reserved and very precise way. He’s got very clear thinking, and I just cannot get over how generous he is with his time and his advice to me. He told me one of the things that was really important, he said an offhand comment, but he’s like, “You’re really easy to understand, so therefore you’re easy to help. I know what is important to you, and so therefore you’re easy to help and you’re easy to interface with.” And so his point is every young founder thinks they have to be an Elon or Steve Jobs, and he’s like, “But I’m not like an Elon or Steve Jobs.” And the massive success, not only what he’s done for Spotify, one of the best apps ever created. I think they have the most, I think there’s only one other company in the world that has more paid subscribers than they do, and it’s Netflix. But think about the way you feel when you get done using Spotify. And this is why I like all the top people there too and they’ve also been working together for excessively a long time. Gustav, Alex, Daniel, all of them is they want you when you’re done using Spotify to feel good. If me and you spend an hour listening to our favorite music on Spotify, you feel great. You spend an hour listening to Tim Ferriss’ podcast, inspired, you feel great. An audiobook now, you feel great. I spend an hour on TikTok or Reels, I feel like shit. Like Twitter? Oh, I can’t. Tim Ferriss: It’s like the anti-therapy. David Senra: But they’re trying to put something. Tim Ferriss: If you want to send yourself backwards. David Senra: So I like what they’re doing. Tim Ferriss: Is there any other advice that has stuck from Daniel to you? David Senra: Yeah, so let’s go to the — Tim Ferriss: And then I won’t lose track of that. David Senra: The archetype I think is really important. I think you’ll really vibe with what his opinion on or his perspective on this is. Yeah, Daniel will tell you advice in a, he’s like a wise old man. I don’t know how to describe it. So one thing is implied and never explicitly stated is he just doesn’t feel he has any, there’s no ceiling on what he can achieve, or what he can learn, or the effect he can have in the world. And when you spend time with him, that is transferred to you. And it’s one of the most important things. And I don’t even know if I told him this. I have tears in my eyes thinking about it. And then I remember hanging out with him in Stockholm. He’s done phenomenal stuff with Spotify, one of the best apps ever created at best businesses. He’s wildly successful as an investor too. And so I remember asking him, this is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. And I go, “Were you always interested in investing?” Because I knew his story, we’ve talked a lot about this. And he goes, “No, I didn’t even know anything about it. I started learning.” I go, “When did you start learning?” He’s like, “2018.” I go, “How’d you start learning?” He goes, “Patrick’s podcast.” And so he would just listen to people. He’s like, “I like that idea, I’ll take that idea. Oh, I don’t like that idea, I don’t like that at all. I’ll avoid that.” And the way Patrick describes, it’s like out of anybody you know, Daniel has the ability to apply what he’s learning faster than anybody else, and at a grander scale. Tim Ferriss: I think he’s also a very, very, very good systems thinker. He is not at a risk cobbling together this sort of camel that is a horse designed by committee that has a bunch of inherent problems and conflicts within it. He’ll be able to figure out how to put pieces together from first principles that function well as a whole. David Senra: Let me tell one other piece of advice he gave me, and he tells it in a story form. This is why he is the wise old man, and essentially was, remember why people love you. You sit in a room and you read all the time, and then you make this thing on the other side that educates and inspires us and gives us energy. And as soon as you stop doing that and you start saying yes to all these distractions, and I don’t even know, I think we might’ve talked about this in the episode we did, that comes out in a few weeks, but he tells it in a story, and he tells a story from another person. So he’s not telling you, “David, go do this.” He’s like, “Let me tell you about this little genius,” or not little genius. “This guy’s really impressive. Look at what he’s accomplished and everything else.” And then the story will hit you hours later. And he’s like, “Oh, yeah, we’ve invited him to the conference over time. I’ve invited him to visit and I keep hearing no.” And I’m like, “Oh, he’s like telling me you’re saying yes to too many things.” The magic that you have is because you say no, and once you start saying yes, and you’re at every conference, you’re traveling around, you’re doing all this sort of stuff, the magic disappears. Tim Ferriss: I’m curious what you think are some of the different archetypes because I think of the 100 plus startups that I’ve invested in since 2008, and there’s a lot of variability. You’ve got the engineer, let’s call it the engineer founder, somebody like Tobi of Shopify or Luis von Ahn of Duolingo. Then you’ve got genius operator, negotiator warrior, like a Travis Kalanick, right? Very different personalities, very different superpowers. And you just go down the list and you see some people come from a finance, numbers, spreadsheet God perspective, and they just have an analytical advantage. It’s very comparable to investing in some ways, looking at the investing world. They have this analytical advantage, let’s just call it. And I was trying to pick out what, if anything, might be commonalities because you also have the crazy artists who then figures out how to harness some of their superpower. And it strikes me that there are at least two that immediately jumped to mind. One is longer term time horizon. David Senra: Those are the people I’m obsessed with. Tim Ferriss: Like the Jeff Bezos type of mindset where it’s like if you have the exact same toolkit, the exact same competency, out of the box genetically, you’re built exactly the same as someone else, but you are able to think and plan longer term, it can be a huge advantage. Second is something that you mentioned where Daniel was saying to you, “This is the magic.” Just remember this is the magic. When other opportunities, other shiny objects show up, because they will even in very early stages. And if you deviate, it’s incredibly easy to self-immolate if you lose track of that. You see that a lot when CEOs get replaced, sometimes, founder CEOs and sometimes they need to be replaced. But what else would you add to that or how would you expand on any of it?David Senra: Just look at the founders of some of the biggest companies in the world now, they would go to war against each other, so think about Oracle and Microsoft. You can’t think of two different founder archetypes than Bill Gates and Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison’s like, “I’m a sprinter. I have intense, very intense periods of work, weeks at a time, months at time, and then I need to go on my boat with a bunch of Italian models. This is how I have to live my life.” Bill Gates is, we’d be walking into this room right here, and his feet would be under the ground underneath his desk. He’s sleeping for three hours. He’s getting back up and he’s going back on the, he’s a grinder. And then you have, I’ve been trying to name some of these and I haven’t done this yet. And the problem is I never write anything, and this is all improv, but one of them was the anti-business billionaire. And so what I, in that category is these people are so obsessed about one thing and that’s the quality of the product that they’re making. They make non-financial decisions like Steve Jobs making sure that the inside of the Mac looks beautiful even though you can’t open it up and it costs more money. He doesn’t care. He wants the best product. James Dyson’s like this, he’s an anti-business billionaire. Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, anti-business billionaire. These guys, they’re obsessed with two things, quality of the product that they’re making and retaining control of their company over long term. And the funny part about this, the reason I call them anti-business billionaires is because if you make the world’s best product and you retain control over your company, you wind up with the money anyways. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I can think of a few people, I mean within my portfolio who retained a lot of their equity at least, and that’s it. Which is preserving the magic in terms of the best product. David Senra: Well look, everybody’s like, “Look at what’s happening to Larry Ellison right now.” It’s like, yeah, the guy I think they raised, I think this could be wrong, but I think Oracle raised 32 million of equity in their IPO and no more after that. And then the guy would refuse, even when they were almost going out of business in 1990, he still wouldn’t sell. They’re like, “Sell your equity.” Like, “No.” It might be worth nothing, he just wouldn’t sell it, and then he’s buying back stock. He owns, I think, 40, I think he went down to 24 percent, now he’s back to 41 percent of Oracle. The company’s 50 years old, 45 years old. I think he was 30-something when he founded the company. He’s just an anomaly. And then you have people like Elon where it’s just like, “I’m going to run.” I wouldn’t even think that’s possible, how the hell do you run seven companies at the same time? Tim Ferriss: I can barely manage three employees, I don’t know. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: I don’t have a good answer. David Senra: That is the point. I do think Daniel hit on something that no one else has put in front of me. It’s like, man, there’s not, the people are going to dominate. Obviously, Elon’s the most famous entrepreneur in the world, but even Bezos is very different. And then you have these people that some of the people just like to make money, and that is their scoreboard. This is another thing I learned from Michael Dell. There’s two things. One thing you just said: protecting the magic. The advice that Dell gave me when I had dinner with him, and he does this in story form too, because that guy’s been running his business for 41 years, 41 years. It’s insane. And his whole thing is just like, “You’re not going to be taken out by competition. You’re going to sabotage yourself.” “Entrepreneurs sabotage themselves, and the amount of people that were doing the same thing I was doing, and they were ahead of me.” This is Dell talking, “They were ahead of me, but then they got to 500 million year in revenue and they’re like, ‘I have a house on Lake Austin now.’” They’re in the same city. They’re doing the same thing as him in the same city, and they’re smoking them. They’re ahead of them by a few hundred million, and they’re like, “Oh, I can chill now.” No, you can’t, because you’ve got Michael Dell right across the river and he’s not going to chill. That guy has no chill. When I went to him, I was like, “What the?” I heard he’s got this wonderful house in Hawaii, his son was telling me about this, and we were in Austin in July. You know, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: It’s hot. David Senra: What are you doing here? And Michael’s answer is simple. He goes, “I love my business and my business is here.” He wasn’t being mean to me, he was like, “That’s a stupid question, David. I’m working. I love what I do, this is what I’m doing.” So one thing from his autobiography though is that really, I used to say it only works if you build a business that’s authentic to you. And this is why I asked you about your inner monologue earlier, because I really feel the reason people do their best work usually later in life, in business, is obviously more experienced network, finances, everything else, but I think because they know themselves better. I think me and you, if we would’ve met 10 years ago, we’d be different people and we also wouldn’t know each other. Know ourselves as much as we do now, where I think I’ve built a business and you have two based on what I know about you, completely authentic to you, and that’s the only way it’s going to work over long term. And I used to say authentic and Michael Dell’s autobiography, which he narrates by the way, the Audible’s excellent. I listened to it three times before I read it to do the episode on it. And there’s a guy named, I think Lee Walker who Michael brought in when Michael was 21. He was in his forties, and he was an older, wiser man, and he had to quit after four years. He was basically running the company with Michael. He’s like, “We’re fighting. We’re taking on IBM with a thousand dollars of working capital from a shitty office in the industrial part in Austin.” IBM’s the biggest company in the world. I didn’t know this, it was the first company to hit $100 billion market cap. “My back hurts. I’m losing hair, I can’t sleep. I got digestive issues.” Lee’s dead after four years. And he goes, “And Michael’s excited. It’s invigorated him,” and he gave me the line, he goes, “because he built a business that was natural to him. I’m dying and he’s thriving because it’s natural to him and it’s not natural to me.” And I think that’s the key, man. People are like, “Oh, I’m going to imitate X, Y, and Z.” It’s like, no, no, no. You should be copying the how, not the what. You don’t copy what they did, you copy how they did it, and then you just take the little ideas that make sense to you. So you ask, “How am I applying this for my own work?” I am either completely apathetic and ignore something or completely obsessed. It’s zero or 100 and nothing in the middle. So the reason I love Munger, because Munger gave me really — Munger and your friend Naval, had a big role in this too. Gave me the blueprint where he’s just like, “Hey, we found that…” Oftentimes Munger has this line that oftentimes the winning system in business goes ridiculously far, maximizing and/or minimizing one or a few variables. And he used Costco like the example, and then he has another line. “Find a simple idea and take it seriously.” Sharing lessons from biographies of great people is a very, very simple idea. Doing it for nine years, working 70 hours a week at it, building systems for it, redoing it over and over again is not — that’s the serious part. His other quote that I’ve already shared earlier, “There’s ideas worth billions in a $30 history book.” That’s another idea. That’s maybe why the work will be valuable and attract the audience that it could attract, another idea from him. You want to maneuver yourself into an area that you’re intensely interested in, that just being a fanatic, like a Sam Walton or a Jim Sinegal or a Sol Price is just — Jeff Bezos, very helpful. These are fanatics, they’re intensely interested in what they’re doing. That is worth a lot of money, and I’ve become friends with Michael Ovitz, who’s also one of the first guests on my new show. And his whole thing is like, you cannot fight against your job. That’s one of the best pieces of advice. He’s like, “People fight against their job all the time and they lose.” You have to find something that you’re intensely drawn to it. Tim Ferriss: So I have a couple of bullets. You should explain who Michael Ovitz is. Why don’t you do that first, and then I’ll just hop to two questions related to Michael Ovitz specifically. David Senra: Michael Ovitz is a shark. He’s one of the most intense people. I think he’s 80 by now. So Rick and I live very close to each other in Miami, and we always have breakfast at the same spot that I’m not going to say publicly. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, good idea. David Senra: And so we’re hanging out — Tim Ferriss: The disinformation campaign. Yeah, it’s always at Denny’s. Moons Over My Hammy. David Senra: So his phone is on the table and it rings and it says “Michael Ovitz” and I gasped. I’m like, “Oh,” I read — everybody knows who Michael — Michael Ovitz was the most powerful man in Hollywood at one time. He had like 75 percent market share, 90 percent market share. He was the most powerful agent. He’s the founder of CAA, which still exists to this day. And I’m like, “Oh, God, I know who that is. I’ve done episodes of this guy.” And so he picks up and they’ve been friends for 20 years, 25 years, something like that. And he goes, “Hey, I’m sitting here with somebody you might know. Have you ever heard of David Senra and the Founders podcast?” And Michael pauses, he goes, “I listened to four of them yesterday.” He was on his boat in St. Barts. Tim Ferriss: That’s incredible. David Senra: No, but this is how — he’s a shark and a killer. He’s on his boat in St. Barts, he’s like studying Rockefeller and Vanderbilt. He’s quoting stuff from the episode and so, we wind up having dinner. Tim Ferriss: Rockefeller, one of the biggest sharks to ever live. David Senra: 100 percent. And so we wound up having dinner, and this is one of the things I asked him, because his whole thing is going to run through — you’re going to meet thousands of people in your life. He’s going to definitely meet way more people than I will, because I’m an introvert. And he used to call 300 people a day, because he was kind of running Hollywood. Ovitz’s advice to me was just like, “You’re going to meet thousands of people in your life, and what I would recommend is just spend all the time with a handful that really matter.” And he’s like, “For me, Rick is one of those people.” And I go, “Why?” And obviously, he’s like, “Well, he’s intelligent,” basically. But he’s like, “Because he tells me the truth.” Tim Ferriss: That is one thing you can definitely reply. That’s one thing you can rely on Rick for. David Senra: But in general — Tim Ferriss: Not sure he can help himself. Not sure it’s a conscious decision. David Senra: No, but in general, his whole point is when you get to be as famous and as well-known, as wealthy as Ovitz, everybody is going to kiss your ass. Everybody wants something from you. They won’t either want to tell you how great you are, or they want money from you, or they want you to sell, buy something. And you’re just like, there’s so few people that you know that truly love you for you and don’t want anything from you. They just want to be friends. And they will tell you the truth. And this is the very dangerous thing that really successful people do. They surround themselves with people that don’t tell them the truth. And this is an idea I got from Jim Casey, the founder of UPS. He realized that there’s this weird capture if you only talk to your top executives, so let’s say you have 10 top executives, and then they distribute everything else to the company. They work themselves in a position where they have the ear of the king and you hear nothing good. So he’s like, “I don’t want to talk to them at all.” He would stop and talk to every single — he’d make his driver stop every single time they see a brown truck. And he would talk to the people doing the actual service. Tim Ferriss: Because he wouldn’t get the bad news or they would — David Senra: They would tell them what actually is going on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: What is actually happening? And the crazy impressive founders that I’ve been able to spend a lot of time with, most of them are 60, 70, 80 years old. Those are my favorite. I love them. They’re not in their office. They’re in their warehouses. They’re on the factory line. They’re in their stores. They’re in constant contact with the customer and the person delivering the service to the customer. Not with their — they’re not looking at a whiteboard with their executives. They’re very practical, non-theoretical people. I think it’s really important. So yeah, I think in my own thing, it’s just like I like to be obsessed and focus on one thing. I don’t like to multitask. So therefore everybody is like every single publisher. It’s like, “Write a book, you should do this.” I’m like, everybody says, “Hey, I like X, so do Y.” And I’m like, “But then if I do Y, I don’t do X.” And so my whole thing is just very simple. I want to do one thing relentlessly. Tim Ferriss: So related to Michael Ovitz, there are a few notes here that I think relate to the new show and the interview you did with him. And I want to ask about two of them. So the first is the benefits of low introspection. And the second — so you can tackle these in either order is “this can’t be my life,” in quotation marks, is a powerful motivator. Can you expand on those?David Senra: So “This can’t be my life” is a very powerful motivator. You see it over and over again. I think the sense of drive, the way you grew up on Long Island, the way I grew up, I was like, “I’m not going out like this.” I don’t care what I have to do — Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to replay this movie. David Senra: No way. I think in many cases, seeing examples of what you don’t want your life to be is more powerful than seeing what you want it to be. I think maybe that one comes first and then, you start to see, “Oh, actually this is the path I want to go down.” Tim Ferriss: There’s an expression in Japanese, which is [foreign language] is like opposite side. [foreign language] is teacher and it’s someone who teaches you by showing you what not to do. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right. David Senra: Yeah. I would say my family definitely the case — Tim Ferriss: One of those. David Senra: Yeah, you just see this over and over again. And so with him, he grew up in the valley. He could see where he wanted to be. He could see the mansions of Beverly Hills. He saw the contrast between, “This is what I’m worried about with social media.” It’s like before we grew up, what do you see? You basically see, “Oh, that’s the nice neighborhood over there. That’s kind of a bad neighborhood.” Now you see the richest people in the world every day and the poorest people in the world, you’re exposed to nothing but extremes, which is like we’ve never — in human history, we’ve never been exposed to that. And what is the long-term effects of that? I have a teenage daughter now, and I think there’s a lot of negativity of this like, you only see the most beautiful people. If you were just in a town where we grew up, you might see a really beautiful woman. You’re not seeing them all day long. It’s just this unfair — Tim Ferriss: Barrage. David Senra: Yeah, barrage of unattainable standards. So with him, he was fiercely driven to succeed. And one of my favorite parts of his book, the guy now, wildly successful, but even before that, he left, I think it was William Morris Agency, he starts CAA, they started to have a little success. He winds up buying a house in Brentwood and it was like $650,000, which is fantastic, but nothing compared to what’s going to happen over the next decades in his life. But he just woke up every morning, he’s like, “I can’t believe I live in Brentwood.” “I can’t believe this. I did this.” And then once you start seeing results, the grind becomes very addictive. And he, if you had, what’s his archetype, grinder. I’m going to throw sheer hours and energy. He’s also an amazing — one of the best salespeople alive, very charismatic. He’s got a lot of superpowers. I actually met Marc Andreessen. I asked him this because Marc Andreessen is on record saying that when he started a16z, they essentially copied CAA. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I think they brought Michael Ovitz in. David Senra: They did. They both talk about this. And I asked him, I go, “What do you think is Michael’s superpower?” He’s like, “He’s the world’s greatest agent and therefore the greatest salesperson, the world’s greatest salesperson.” And so that’s one example from his book is just like, this can’t be my life. I don’t want to be like this. I’m going to direct all my energy and do something different. Now the low introspection thing is I’m not a controversial person. I’m just sharing lessons from history that I read in a book. You don’t have to listen, you don’t have to pay attention, it doesn’t matter. But when I bring up the fact that a lot of these people have low or zero introspection. Meaning that when they find what they want to do in life, they wake up and they know exactly what they’re doing that day. Sam Walton was not waking up saying, “What are my feelings like today? What should I do? Should I think about the meaning of life?” He’s like, “No, I founded Walmart. I made one Walmart. I’m going to make another one and another one and another one. I will make every Walmart better and better and better.” And I think having low introspection after you found your mission in life — and this is a sad thing, I think most people never find their mission. I know I found my mission. I don’t think about what should I do today. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to talk, obviously, about the new show and we’ve been alluding to it and mentioning some of the guests. But before we get there — so you’re about to meet Michael and he had been ostensibly on vacation, but he’s listening to your episodes on Rockefeller and others. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Do you recall any of the other episodes? David Senra: The Vanderbilt one stuck up in my mind. I mean, we text about them. I don’t remember — the Vanderbilt is the one that really — the Rockefeller and the Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt especially because Vanderbilt is like — what I say is I’m kind of telling the same story over and over again. I think it’s more like church than it is like — just like I went to church. I grew up as a fundamentalist Christian. We met together with believers on regular intervals on Wednesday and Sunday. And it’s not like the preacher got up there and was like, “Hey, we talked about that Jesus guy enough, we’re going to move on to somebody else.” It’s like we literally just go to the same book over and over again. And so I always say there’s always a historical equivalent to anybody we’re dealing with today or in the past. But Vanderbilt, to me — there’s not an entrepreneurial historical equivalent. He’s like Putin or something. When he died, he controlled five percent of the money supply. So one out of $25. Tim Ferriss: So I guess the reason I was asking about the episodes, and I don’t know Michael, so this is not a judgment or criticism of Michael at all, but I suppose if you believe that there is a value to low introspection for the purposes of building a business, which I would agree. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is there not a risk, and I have not listened to those particular episodes on Rockefeller and Vanderbilt, but I’ve read a bit of the history. These are not necessarily people you automatically want to model everything in all — David Senra: No, I think Ovitz would. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So this is I suppose my question. Is there a risk of ending up amoral, immoral or sociopathic, if you — one of the things you optimize for is low introspection because — or maybe that’s just hardwiring frankly, and you’re just not inclined to do it. David Senra: That’s a good question. Tim Ferriss: Because this archetype does exist, just like the rape, pillage, destroy archetype is an archetype. David Senra: They’re overrepresented in entrepreneurship. Why? Because, if entrepreneurship [is] done correctly, [it yields] the greatest material rewards in human history. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: So of course, it’s going to be full of psychopaths and sociopaths. Whatever — I don’t know if you know the numbers on this, but they assume five percent of the population’s sociopathic or something like that. Is that something like that? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know the numbers. David Senra: Let’s just make it up. It’s five percent of the general population. It’s probably five times that of entrepreneurs and investors and people like this or anybody — political power. Power in general. This is why I think the work of Robert Caro is so interesting. And I always make the argument that there should only — there should be a law. The only one law that I would foist upon society is that there’s only one person allowed to write a thousand-page biography. I have no problem reading that. Almost none of the books that I’ve read that are a thousand pages needed to be a thousand pages. They just didn’t know what to put in there. Robert Caro is the only one that should be able to write long biographies because everything that he has in there should be in there. I think he’s a master of his craft. He’s the best to ever do it. But he’s saying, “I’m not writing biographies. I’m writing about how humans accumulate and then wield power. And I did it first on a local level in New York with Robert Moses, and now I’m showing what happens on a national level. And guess what, LBJ would sacrifice everything to get what he wanted. Personal ethics, his relationships, everything.” Tim Ferriss: Stealing elections. David Senra: This is the wonderful thing about studying history. History doesn’t repeat, human nature does. So if you just read Will and — and you both love Will and Ariel Durant, right? Read the history of human civilization. Read their hundred-page book, Lessons of History. The same stuff repeats over and over again. So when it comes out and you see this on the news, “Oh, of course no one stole the election.” It’s like stealing every election in all different countries. Stealing the elections is an American pastime. Just read Robert Caro. And it could be a little Senate election in Texas. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. David Senra: If you don’t think — Tim Ferriss: That missing ballot box. David Senra: Yeah. The line I have about this is from Will Durant, where he’s just like, “In every age, humans are dishonest and governments are corrupt.” It’s one of my favorite quotes from Lessons of History, and every age, nothing that we’re doing is new. We’re telling the same stories over and over and over again. You see the same people over and over again. So yeah, I’m sure there’s a ton of people that read these biographies and that listen to my podcast that are absolute psychopaths. I don’t think Ovitz is a psychopath. He’s an extreme winner. He wants to win. Tim Ferriss: The line may be pretty thin. David Senra: Yeah, of course. Of course. Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying he is, by the way, sociopath. It’s just that, just like you were mentioning, you can convince yourself of a bad idea, very compellingly, just as you can a good idea. It’s like when you start to get into the gray waters of morality as winning compounds upon winning, oftentimes the person who cares less about other people wins. If they can discard that consideration. David Senra: 100 percent, and that’s been true in the past. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: True today, will be true.That’s the point, that this is why it’s so interesting. You have to — I look at this as almost — I think something I didn’t even understand is I have the ability to step outside of myself, and I’m kind of like a casual observer of human nature. Tim Ferriss: I want to ask you, and then I’m going to hop to questions about podcasting on the new show, about how you think about assessing leaders, entrepreneurs, reading biographies or autobiographies, and figuring out what people claim as things that help them succeed, to succeed, actually help them versus hindering them. In other words, what are the “because of” versus the “in spite of?” So for instance, if high disagreeability or low agreeability is common across a lot of founders. To what extent is that — can you point to that as one of the causal factors for their success as opposed to just an emergency break they had on, causing all sorts of problems that they managed to overcome, so they succeeded despite. How do you think about separating those two things? David Senra: So one of the things I love about James Dyson, who is a hero of mine, it’s the person that on the planet that I want to meet that I haven’t met. The number one is him. And what I love about him is how stubborn he is, because I see myself in that. And it turns out his stubbornness worked out for him because he had the right idea, but this is where it goes back to like you can’t blindly copy. There’s no formula. There’s no formula, there’s no track. So it’s like he’s stubborn on an idea that was a great idea, it just needed more time. You could be stubborn on an idea that’s terrible and going nowhere. And then you did the exact same thing for the exact same amount of time. And on the other side of that, he has one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world, and you have a miserable life. There’s no answers to that. There’s nobody coming to save you. None of this shit works if you can’t trust your own judgment and figure things out. That’s why when people are like, “Oh, more people should be entrepreneurs.” I don’t know about that. I want to encourage the people that think they can do it, to do it. But I think in many cases, most people should work, like they should choose a different path because it’s very, very risky. Like Todd Graves, the Raising Cane’s guy I told you about, right? His whole thing is entrepreneurs should have higher risk tolerance. James Dyson, multiple times, risked every single possession he had to chase his dream. He signed over his house multiple times. If he failed, they could have been homeless. It worked out for him. Todd Graves had this crazy way to finance the first 28 Raising Cane’s where essentially he goes to an angel investor, he goes to Tim Ferriss and says, “Hey, you’re going to give me a 200,000 loan, okay? It’s going to be subjugated loan to the bank. I’m going to guarantee you a 15 percent return on the $200,000 for X amount of time.” You say, “Oh, that sounds great. You’re paying me 15 percent on my 200 grand.” But you don’t get any equity. I take that 200,000 equity that I have from this document from Tim. I go to a bank and say, “This is as collateral. Loan me the other 600 grand or whatever the number is to get this up and running.” And he did that for 28 times and he’s like, “Oh, I’m rolling, rolling, rolling.” Leveraged up to his eyeballs. What’s the problem? “I open up. Every time I open a new Raising Cane’s, there’s a line out the door from day one.” Well, then a little thing called Hurricane Katrina comes and guess where? 28 of his restaurants are all in Louisiana, and he almost died, and he says, “If I didn’t come out of that, there would be no story. It’d be gone.” And then I guess the second part of — I don’t know why this popped into my mind, but when you’re reading history, we’re reading about stories that happened a hundred years ago, 200 years ago, 50 years ago. Some of them are from that person’s own mouth. Like, imagine if you tell your own life story, you’re going to, here’s the good part. You’re going to hide the bad. You’re human, right? And so people are like, “Well, how do you know if what you’re reading is true?” The line is like if you think the news is fake, wait till you read history. Tim Ferriss: It’s just old news. David Senra: I don’t know. My idea is we’re not taking a test at the end of this. I’m not saying did this actually happen in 1912. It’s like, is the idea behind what he’s doing a good idea for me? And so the example of Rockefeller that you see that Elon used, where Rockefeller tells the story, I don’t know if it actually happened, but he tells the story where they would have to solder closed the barrels that they transport oil in, and he goes up one day and he says, “How many drops of solder do you use?” He’s like, “I use 40.” He’s like, “Have you ever tried 38?” He’s like, “No, we never tried 38.” “Can you try 38?” They tried 38, it leaks. “Okay, try 39.” They tried 39, doesn’t leak. That one drop of solder at the time of the business saved him $2,500 a year, the business grows and compounds for the next three decades, and now he’s saving like hundreds of thousands from that then. Did that actually happen? I don’t know. But that’s a good idea to find the limit, to actually, “Hey, maybe I should control my costs a little more. Maybe I need to actually see if I can do this in a more efficient way.” I don’t know if it happened. I just want the idea behind it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, just to reiterate what you’re saying, it’s tough to separate the fact from fiction, right? And then sometimes this is actually why I just read fiction because I’m like, “There still are truths to extract,” right? There are principles that you can extract from, this is now cliched because it’s been made into a popular movie, but Dune or Stranger in a Strange Land. You can actually pull a lot from just straight-up fiction. And then when it comes to the business side, because I’ve read so many, not as many as you, but tons of business books, still have my early copies and my notes from those books with Losing my Virginity, Richard Branson, early Yvon Chouinard, I think it’s Let My People Go Surfing, et cetera, still have all those books, and when you look at — part of the reason also that I like early biographies, so let’s just say like Hard Drive first on Bill Gates versus a later, I don’t want to say sanitized, but let’s say sanitized version where — David Senra: I’m going through this right now, where it’s like, look — Tim Ferriss: Warren Buffett, love the guy, and he’s turned himself into the “Awww, shucks” grandpa neighbor who takes his garbage out in a robe. David Senra: Killer. Killer. Tim Ferriss: He’s a killer, and I remember reading, I think it was The Making of an American Capitalist way back in the day, and the story that stuck out, and I hope I’m not inventing this, I don’t see why I would, but his routine was to go home, walk upstairs, and read. David Senra: Step over his children. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. Was it his son — David Senra: Yes. Step over — Tim Ferriss: — who had fallen down the stairs, is sprawled out like a chalk outline at a crime scene, steps over his injured son to go upstairs to do more reading of S1 filings or whatever he was doing. David Senra: You bring up something interesting. This is why I don’t believe them when they say they have regrets at the end of their life. So if I read Making of an American Capitalist, an excellent book. I think that’s actually the best biography. Tim Ferriss: It’s so good. David Senra: You read Snowball after his wife leaves him and he says, “The biggest mistake, if I could go back and live life again, the biggest mistake I would do is I would change whatever I need, so” — I think her name was Susie — “didn’t leave me.” No, I don’t believe you. Tim Ferriss: I don’t buy it. David Senra: No, none of them. When they all say — like a Leonardo Del Vecchio, the guy that started Luxottica. I think I had it translated from Italian. Some of these biographies are in different languages so, again, go back to differentiation, what can I do that no one else is doing, we’ve translated the Red Bull book from German. Tim Ferriss: It was awesome. I listened to that. David Senra: I appreciate that.But he gets to the end of his life, he is an orphan. Dad dies young — Tim Ferriss: What was the company again? David Senra: Luxottica. So they essentially — Tim Ferriss: [inaudible]. David Senra: Monopolize glasses, everything. So Mark Zuckerberg just invested, I think, three and a half billion dollars for like three percent of the company. Tim Ferriss: Wow. David Senra: And so for essentially 60 years, he just a slow, methodical Rockefeller-esque march through the entire industry until he controls every single component of eyeglasses, sunglasses, everything. It’s like completely dominant. He gets to the end of his life, he’s just like, “Oh, yeah. The one regret I have is…” He’s married multiple times. I think there’s like a 50-year gap between his oldest son and his youngest son. So it’s like he’s like a wild boy, but he’s like, “The one regret I have is I didn’t spend more time with my kids.” No, you wouldn’t change a thing. Tim Ferriss: It’s not true. David Senra: It’s not true because I don’t think they could. That’s what where you just said. It’s like maybe they didn’t have a choice. Maybe it’s just hardwired. And so I’m going through that literally right now because this week I read Source Code which is Bill Gates’ autobiography about the first 20 years of his life, his version. I reread Hard Drive, Overdrive, which is also written by the same guys that wrote Hard Drive, and then I pulled all my highlights and notes for Paul Allen’s description of Bill Gates in Paul Allen’s autobiography. There is a vast difference between what’s in Source Code and what is in Hard Drive, and it’s obviously Hard Drive is more accurate. It’s written right after it happened. Bill is not the 70-year-old man he is now, and he’s in a different world, but watch his interviews, watch the documentary on Netflix about him. He’s like, “I was hardcore. That was my advantage.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. David Senra: He was. Tim Ferriss: Killer. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And also these questions, a lot of the questions that I ask myself when I’m reading any nonfiction — I shouldn’t say any nonfiction, let’s say biographies where I’m hoping to model something. One is like is, or an autobiography, okay, what’s the bias here. Are there any particular biases I should be aware of, okay? Is anyone in like reputation rehab mode before they die? Okay, let’s keep that. David Senra: Sure. Tim Ferriss: What type of survivorship bias might there be, right? Who tried the same? Do we have 99 out of 100 who tried something similar and failed? Let’s take a look at the tape. Okay. Luck is luck. Luck’s everywhere, right? So the fact that Bill Gates ended up with a computer, winding it up with the computers, it’s just like it’s, yeah. David Senra: Timing. I think timing. Tim Ferriss: Timing is a huge piece. By the way, these are not all reasons to discount anything, but I just want to mention a couple of that I try to think of. The other I try to think of, because I might try to mimic someone in sports if I’m trying to learn something, or language learning or whatever it might be, is what are attributes, what is trainable and what is not trainable, right? Because I’ve heard these stories from people who know Bill Gates and they’re like, “Well, we were going to go on this short vacation in…” fill in the blank, I can’t remember, Costa Rica, right? They’re going to go on a birding trip in the morning. It’s just like a two, three-hour thing with a world-class birding guide. They do the trip, and the night before, Bill has stayed up and read five books on birding, memorized them seemingly without trying, and is basically having like a peer-to-peer discussion with the birding expert as they’re going through the rainforest. That’s not normal. David Senra: No. It’s not. Tim Ferriss: That’s like “I’m going to do calf raises to make my body look like Michael Phelps.” No, you’re not. That’s not going to work. So it’s like when I’m looking for people to model, I’m trying to find people who have hopefully a comparable composition of strengths that I can amplify in myself or that are coachable, right? And so the question after all that is, does anyone stand out to you, of the biographies or people you’ve met, where you’re like in terms of someone doing the most with the hand they’ve been dealt — so maybe they’re not a freak of nature. David Senra: So not aliens. Tim Ferriss: They’re not a freak of nature, necessarily, because there are freaks of nature among the people that you study, the people I study, but it’s like, all right, these people might have a few strengths, but they’re not complete freaks. They’re not the Usain Bolts of — fill in the blank, and man, oh, man, did they play their hand well. They’re just so good at playing the hands that they are dealt, that person. Does anybody stick out? David Senra: Sam Walton. Tim Ferriss: All right. David Senra: Sam Walton’s one of my favorite entrepreneurs. If you really think about it, so he had this crazy thing, this crazy idea. I don’t think he obviously didn’t know what Walmart was going to turn into, but one of the ways they avoided all the inheritance tax is if you give away the equity before it’s valuable. The last time I checked, if you look at all of the Walmart equity owned by the family, that means the wealth that came from his idea, it would be like 432 billion today if it was consolidated in one person, right? When you study Sam, he’s obviously smart, but he was just like, he didn’t really know what he was going to do. Then he had this idea, he’s like, “Well, maybe I can be good at retailing.” And then he starts out in Newport, Arkansas with one store. This is what drives me insane about the modern day entrepreneurship industry is how everybody, they start out with like weird goals, like “I’m going to build a trillion-dollar company,” or “I’m going to be the fastest person to a hundred million ARR,” and you’re just like, “Okay, but none of these people talk like that. You’re doing it for the wrong reason, so you probably won’t get there if that’s just the case.” It’s like what Jerry Seinfeld says, “If you’re just doing it for money, you only get so far.” With him, he was just fascinated by stores and trying to make it a little bit better every day, and he spends — Tim Ferriss: It was on vacation, right? Didn’t matter where he was, he would go into a retail store — David Senra: His kids told the story. It’s just like vacation was essentially driving to different towns and checking out different retailers. The most important thing about his story, one of the most important things, is this idea to go slow now so you can go faster later. And so you’re like, “Okay.” The beginning of his career, he’s in one tiny store. I think they start doing 25,000 a year. 25,000 a year in revenue, and I think he gets up to like 250 grand. It took him five years. But for five years he just had one story. It was like experimenting, understanding, trying to figure out what the different parts of retail are because there’s no such thing as discounting and wholesaling and all this other stuff that he was doing that he’s going to do later on. And then what’s fascinating is later in his career after Walmart, he then takes that idea, he goes and visits Sol Price, who we mentioned earlier, he takes that idea. He’s like, “Oh, this is a great idea. I’m going to do this.” He does Sam’s Club. In that same five-year period, so you have the first five years, one store, separated by maybe 40 years in the career, that second five years when he’s starting something else, in that five-year period he doesn’t have one store. He winds up doing, I think, a hundred stores and like seven billion in revenue from this new category because you see him learning. And so, yes, I think he was brilliant, but he’s not memorizing five books overnight in doing that. This is like mine, I don’t think — man, one of the reasons that I do what I do is because Munger became a hero and he talks over and over again about being a biography nut, that he read more biographies than anybody else. I got to spend three hours inside of his house talking to him right before he died. I don’t care how many biographies I read, how many books I read for the rest of my life, I cannot have a brain like him. I will never have a brain like him. Anybody at 99 is going to have some level of cognitive decline. You know what one of my first thoughts was about an hour and a half into the conversation with him was, “This guy had to be terrifying when he was 60.” Terrifying. Terrifying. Think about this. Everybody that I know, when I get to meet fancy people I always ask them, “Who’s the smartest person you know? What’s the best business you know?” It can’t be like Apple. It’s like these interesting, weird things, and every single person that says — if they know Buffett and they don’t tell you it’s Buffett, they’re wrong. Buffett chose this guy to let him mold and shape his thinking. What does that tell you about his intelligence? I remember — because this is what I do, again, I’m like laying bricks every day. I don’t think I’m a brilliant person. I just show up every day and don’t quit. And so I read. Once I find Munger, I read, literally, not, oh, I read some of the books, I read every single book on Munger. Then I reread my highlights over and over again. So my days, I wake up, work out, read for a few hours, have lunch, then reread past highlights in the afternoon. All my social media posts are just me rereading highlights. I read every single book on Munger, then I reread all the highlights, but then I read all the books he tells me to read, because he’ll tell you, “Read Les Schwab.” He’ll tell you all these things. He’ll tell you Henry Kaiser. I was like, “Who the hell is Henry Kaiser?” Henry Kaiser started a hundred companies. He built the Hoover Dam. He built Liberty ships. I go, “What?” Tim Ferriss: By the way, just the fact that pretty much everyone listening to this podcast will have no idea of who that person is just underscores, I think, how ridiculous it is to get overly fixated on legacy as an excuse for all sorts of behaviors. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Nobody’s going to remember you. David Senra: No. I’m anti-legacy and I’m anti-family dynasty. I think bequeathing your kids a bunch of wealth is — well, that’s another story for another day. Tim Ferriss: But okay, a hundred companies. Right. Hoover Dam, which, by the way, was made in, what, like eight years or 12 years. I mean, some insane time span. David Senra: Crazy. So first of all, I’m freaked out. I’m there, it’s me, two other young entrepreneurs in their 30s, and they had both met Charlie before. And then I’m like 10 minutes in and I’m just like, “Ugh.” I just couldn’t believe what’s happening to me. I’m like, “That’s fucking Charlie Munger over there.” And then you know he’s looking at you, because he’s blind, and so if he’s looking at you like this, he’s not looking at you. He’s got to go like this and this because then he’s got to look through his glasses. So you know when he’s looking at you. And then my friend looks at me, he’s like, “Get in here. Do something.” I literally sat there. Me not speaking for 10 minutes, it’s really hard for me to do. There’s a reason I do monologue podcasts. So then I see we’re in his library, so then I’m like, “Oh, this is my savior,” because I’ve read all those books behind him because he told me to read them. And so this is why I said it doesn’t matter what I do, and this will answer your question a long way. I start asking questions about Henry Kaiser and all these books, and he knows the revenue, he knows the partner, he knows how the business ended, he knows the mistakes they made. And then I go, “Charlie, when’s the last time you read these books?” And he’s like, “15 years ago.” And then I go, when we’re shifting from the library to dinner, I was like, “Charlie, can I go through your library?” He’s like, “Of course.” He’s just sitting in his chair and I’m going through the books and I open them. No notes. Tim Ferriss: Different stock. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, different stock. Oh, my God. So, all right, we are going to get to the things I promised, but I have to ask you. So in addition to smartest person, best business, what are some of your other go-to questions when you meet the fancy folks? David Senra: So who’s the smartest person you know? What’s the best business you know? I actually got to spend some time with Eddie Lampert. So Eddie Lampert at one time was thought to be the next Buffett, and he was mentored by Richard Rainwater, and I find Richard Rainwater really fascinating because Richard Rainwater has probably — Tim Ferriss: Great man too. David Senra: Oh, excellent. Richard, first of all there’s no biographies on him. He died rather young. He probably created more billionaire investors in America than any other person in direct mentorship. Eddie broke the record, I think in like the ’80s or’ 90s for the most taxable income made by an American, and he was super young. And so Eddie lives in Miami and I was at his house. Tim Ferriss: He was like, “Never again. I’m moving to Miami.” David Senra: No, no. No, no. So that might be one of the best investments because he probably paid $12 million for his house and his house will probably sell for 150 million today because it’s on the island that Bezos lives on, and the house is beautiful. Tim Ferriss: I’m sure he won’t even notice it on his balance sheet or in his life. David Senra: He’s much more out of the spotlight now. But again, he’s one of these older guys, just very, very wise and very quiet. He’s like me. He’s introverted. You go to his house, there’s just books everywhere. He’s got this insane yacht that I went on called the Fountainhead. I’ll let people google it. It is insane. Tim Ferriss: I mean, great name too. David Senra: Yeah, but same thing. You go on the boat and you go on the boat, dude, and it’s full of books. It’s the weirdest — Tim Ferriss: Ran out of room at his house, so had to buy a super yacht for the books. David Senra: It’s the weirdest unintended hack ever to build a world-class network of just read a bunch of history and they’ll come get you. They’re like — I’ve never sent a cold DM in my life, ever. I’ve never sent a cold email in my life. Tim Ferriss: All, right. So what do you have? Why did Lampert come? You’re asking him questions. David Senra: I’m asking these questions, right? Basically, and they’re not mean to me. He’s like, “Yeah, but there’s better questions you can ask.” I was like, “Okay, tell me what they are.” And so his answers are, like the smartest person, he’s like, “Well, I spent a bunch of time with Buffett.” I go, “Okay.” He goes, “It’s obviously Buffett.” He goes, “There’s actually more interesting…” And then who’s the best investor, that was another question I asked. He goes, “There’s actually a more interesting question that you’re not asking.” I go, “What’s that?” He goes, “Who’s the best dealmaker?” Tim Ferriss: Mm. Mm-hmm. That’s a great one. David Senra: And I go, “I don’t know what that means.” I don’t know anything about investing. The question I’ve asked Rick and Patrick, they probably think I’m retarded. You can edit that question out, edit that word out. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s fine. David Senra: But they’re just like, “What is wrong with this guy?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. We didn’t even get to — I mean, I would say Brad Jacobs would fit in sort of the dealmaker. Or Zell. David Senra: Yeah. But yeah, but his is like a different — so, okay, this is very fascinating what Eddie said. So again, Eddie, you can go back and read profiles of him. He was like a boy wonderkid. Rick told me a funny story. They used to all be at the same golf club in New Jersey, and Richard Rainwater walked in, and Rick’s like a young kid and Rainwater’s a legend, and he’s making conversation with him. He goes, “We just wait, the best investor in the America’s going to walk through that door.” And Rick goes, “Buffett?” And it was Eddie. So anyways, Eddie’s like, “There’s a better question that you’re not asking.” I was like, “All right. Well, you’re way smarter than I am, tell me.” He goes, “Who’s the best dealmaker?” I don’t know what that means. He goes, “Well, an investor is judged on ROIC, return on invested capital.” He goes, “The two best dealmakers I ever knew were Richard Rainwater and David Geffen.” So the thing about David Geffen, he’s super underrated. He’s another person I’d like to spend time with if I could, is it’s one thing to have a bunch of money. It’s another thing to have a bunch of money and be liquid. There is a line in this profile on Larry Gagosian that I read that says, “Any time there’s a downturn…” Larry Gagosian’s maybe the most successful art dealer in the world. Art soars during great economic times and kind of doesn’t do so well in other times. Any time there was a dip and they needed to make money, they’d call David because they said David is as liquid as the day is long. David gave a 26-year-old Eddie Lampert like 200 million of his own money to run. So David’s just like liquid. Tim Ferriss: Staked him. David Senra: And so he goes, “David is a crazy dealmaker.” He goes — Tim Ferriss: I guess he didn’t stake him. He was an LP. David Senra: I don’t think it was a fund structure. I think it was, “Here’s 200, make it bigger.” Tim Ferriss: Make it bigger. David Senra: I don’t think he’s going to be like, “You make money if I make money.” I don’t think it was a permanent structure, which is interesting. Sam Zell never had a permanent structure. There’s actually a lot of them. I find those more interesting. But anyways, I was like, “Okay, so why is Richard Rainwater one of the best dealmakers?” He’s like, “Because with Richard it was all returns, no capital.” I was like, “What?” He goes, “Richard maneuvered himself into such an influential position in the American economy because of who he knew, and him being involved in your deal immediately made it more valuable that people just gave him the equity.” All returns, no capital. That was like one of my favorite ideas that I’ve ever heard. Yeah, and he would just tell amazing stories. He told me a story where Richard, when he mentors you — like, he recruited Eddie. Eddie was living in New York, working at Goldman Sachs, if I remember correctly. He convinced him to move to Fort Worth, Texas. Have you ever been to Fort Worth? Tim Ferriss: I have. David Senra: Okay. I’ve been there too. There’s nothing there, and in the ’80s there was less than nothing there. This kid moves there, they would travel together, and Eddie said that Richard would want to summer somewhere in Massachusetts, and it was like this 20-room hotel that was members only, so it’s not open to the random public, and he insisted that Eddie be put in the room next to him. One day, a bunch of guys knock on Eddie’s door while he’s in the room supposed to be working and researching, and they come in with a bunch of tools. He’s like, “What are you doing?” He’s like, “Richard wants us to put a hole in this wall.” Richard didn’t want to go in the hallway and walk around to Eddie’s room. So he made them knock a hole and then install a door so he could just go. He could have direct access to Eddie just with a door that didn’t exist. Tim Ferriss: That’s incredible. David Senra: He just had all kinds of crazy stories. Tim Ferriss: All right, so not Buffett, not Munger, smartest person. David Senra: That I met? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, smartest person. Let’s revise that and just say if you could pick one person you’ve met to be your coach/Yoda. David Senra: Oh, Daniel Ek. Tim Ferriss: Daniel Ek. David Senra: Easily. Tim Ferriss: All right. That was fast. Okay. David Senra: Well, again, Brad Jacobs gives me great advice. Michael Dell would give me great advice, like Todd Graves, but this guy is around my age. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. David Senra: It’s like the gap between us is so obvious when you solve for that, and again, I just think of the stuff he does, his clarity of thought. I greatly admire the product. I like products. I guess we should back up what is actually important to you. I don’t actually give a shit how much money you have. I know a lot of people, and I love these, we’re in New York right now, some of my favorite people. I like the PE guys way more than I like the VC guys because they’re just more honest. The PE guys are like, they have great lines about this, they go, “VC gets all the attention, PE gets all the money.” And then they’re like, “The VCs are lying because they say the founders are the customers. No, the LPs are our customers. The founders didn’t give you any money.” Then the PE guys are just honest. Why do you wake up every day? To maximize the value of my LP dollars. I don’t want to play that game. I don’t want to play it at all, but I respect — their honesty is refreshing. Their scoreboard is, “I have $6 billion and I’ll be better if I have eight.” I am obsessed with product. The fact that I work on my podcast for seven days a week, the fact that I hand-edit the transcript, the fact that I do — like MrBeast drives me — he’s like, “You’re stupid. Somebody can edit. Basically you need an editor. You need all these other things.” I just am obsessed. It’s like you don’t work all your life to do what you love to not do it. I don’t want to outsource stuff. I like the craft of making the product. I’m very proud — like when Spotify Wrapped, some people might, because it’s embarrassing. When my Spotify Wrapped comes out this year, the number one podcast on that is going to be my own. I go back and listen to it. One, I think of it as a tool, right? I was on a treadmill in Malibu a few weeks ago listening to episode 221, which I think is the biography of Charlie Munger. I say to Charlie Munger all the time, “We forget how much we forget.” I listened to this hour-long podcast, like, oh, God, he’s got a lot of great ideas that I forgot. I’m not doing it because I like to hear the sound of my own voice. I also do it because do you think Kobe watched game tape? How am I going to get better if I don’t — when I interviewed Michael Dell, really more of a conversation than an interview, but I listened to the Michael Dell episode that I just did a few months ago, and all I hear is the flaws. All I hear is like, “You stupid idiot. You should use three sentences, that could have been one sentence. That is not even interesting. Cut that next time.” That’s how I get better. I go back and listen to it. So I am obsessed with product. The people that I admire the most are great products. It could be Jiro’s sushi. It could be the Spotify app. It could be, it doesn’t matter, shoes that I like. I just love when people take what they do very seriously and I like the craft of it. And I want to dedicate my life to making a product that makes somebody else’s life better. That is what drives me. I understand, and I have a bunch of friends that like the money or building the systems, if you want to go back to archetypes or just having a big empire. I don’t have any employees. You have three. I guess I have two technical subcontractors doing clips for me and thumbnails and stuff like that. But yeah, I don’t have any desire for a giant empire. I’m a little craftsman in my local shed over here. Tim Ferriss: So why do the new podcast, David Senra? David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Why do it? And we can use any number of different entry points here. So number one, why do it? But you don’t have to answer that as number one. I’m also curious where you see the podcast ecosystem. Is it early? Is it late? Is it oversaturated? Is it undersaturated, et cetera? And then how do you diversify an interview-based podcast? David Senra: Okay. So let’s take number one, the why do it. I was resistant on doing it for years because I like to do one thing and I don’t like to not focus. A huge thing, that if you could summarize nine years, 400 biographies into one word of what I’ve learned, is focus. These people, whether they’re psychos, nice people, different industries, they’re remarkably focused. They’re a different species than the current level of lack of attention spans that we have now that I think are getting worse. So focus is especially important. If you look at how I spend my time though, we just talked about the importance of building a business that’s natural to you. Half my waking time, I would like to be completely alone, not in even the house with somebody else. Alone in my reading, thinking. I like solitude a lot to a scary degree. So that makes sense. Founders, reading books all day, that’s what you do. That makes perfect sense. When I’m not doing that though, if you look at what else I’m doing, essentially do this data dump where I’m in silence half the day and then I go out every night that I’m not with my family. I usually have dinner with another founder, usually that I met through the podcast, and we talk for two, three — some people are like, “Oh, really impressed.” People will send me, “I would love to talk to you.” And they send me a calendar for 30 minutes. I go, “I don’t do 30. We’re not even going to start. We haven’t even started. If that’s what you think this is, I don’t care that you’re a billionaire, we’re just never going to meet, ever.” And it’s always super long from the very first time. I can mention all these people, we talked for a long time. So I’m doing this, anyways. And for years, people like Patrick were like, “You stupid idiot. You should be recording these. This is crazy.” And so there’s two things, to answer your question, that happened. One is, the first time me and Patrick grabbed dinner in New York with Daniel Ek, okay? We talked for four hours. And we get in the car because we’re leaving the city and going back to Patrick’s house because I’m going to spend the night there before I go back home. And the first thing Patrick says, and again, this is why it’s important. The piece of advice that Charlie Munger gave us when we were at his house, he’s like, “Your job at your age is to build a seamless web of deserved trust with other people who are like you.” He’s like, “Everybody knows that me and Buffett — I met Buffett when I was 35. He was 28. What they didn’t understand, there’s a bunch of other guys around our age that we built the same level of trust with and we did life with and did deals with forever. Most of them were dead by the time I met Charlie. And so relationships are very important.” And Munger has that line, “Trust is one of the greatest economic factors in the world,” which I’ve never heard anybody else say that. That’s a truly unique idea. Tim Ferriss: I agree with that. David Senra: And so there’s a level of trust that I am very standoffish. People call me a turtle, I get my shell. And so once you’ve penetrated that, I have a level of trust that you want what’s right for me. There’s no weird competitive vibes here, we’re not secret adversaries. I want to see you win. And then we get in the car and he’s just like, “Goddammit, you need to record these.” And he’s like, “I’ve known Daniel for four years. You got more out of him in four hours than I did in four years.” He’s like, “I spoke two percent of the time. You spoke 49 percent. He spoke the other 49 percent.” And he’s just like, “There’s nobody that could speak to the soul of the founder in the world that you can.” And it’s because he says something and it’s not what he’s saying. It’s what Henry Ford did here and Henry Kaiser did there and Jim Casey did over here, and that’s how my brain naturally works. So I was like, “Okay, that was interesting.” And then part of the conversation was Daniel saying to take — I wasn’t doing video. I have 375 episodes because I’m not doing it for fame. I’m introverted. And Daniel’s just saying in a very nice way, “What are you doing? Stop riding the fence. This is the game that you chose.” And I have the data. Video obviously is important in podcasts. You’re lying to yourself again. The importance of somebody telling the truth. I want people around me to check me. I don’t want sycophants. And I’ll tell you the second person that influenced me that calls me and checks me all the time. And so that got in my mind for a while and I was like, “Okay, that’s interesting.” And I get sad when I don’t podcast. I would like to podcast every day and I can’t because I have to read an entire book before I sit down to make an episode. I cannot make more than 52 episodes a year. I just can’t. I can’t read — people are like, “You must read fast.” No, I read slow, 25 pages an hour at most. And I have to do all the other shit I just told you I had to do, highlighting. You know how long this takes? Tim Ferriss: Taking photographs, putting it into Readwise. David Senra: Yeah. And so then something else that’s important to me is I’m not a political person at all. I don’t even read the news. I will find out the important stuff. If there’s a pandemic, I’ll hear about it. If there’s a war, I’ll hear about it. Other stuff, no idea what’s going on. I have no idea what’s going on. I’m purposely aloof. But one thing that I am passionate about is that entrepreneurship is good for the world as long as you’re spending your time building. You mentioned Losing Your Virginity by Richard Branson. He has the best description I’ve ever heard of a business. “All a business is, is an idea that makes somebody else’s life better.” And therefore, there’s always opportunity because there’s infinite ways to make other people’s lives better. And so that’s what I’m trying to do. And so another person who I’ve become close with is Jared Kushner. We live in Miami together. And we went and met for dinner, and Jared’s a really smart and buttoned-up guy. And again, I don’t pay attention to politics. So the way I met him is actually he reached out to Rick and is like, “I’m a huge Founders fan. Can you contact, see if David would speak at my company offsite?” A lot of companies ask me to speak at their company offsite. And I didn’t know anything about Jared. All I know is that people on the internet like to argue about them because of the Trump stuff, but I judge people on how they are with me. This ever happened to you where you were like, “That person’s great,” and you deal with them, like, “Oh, that guy’s terrible,” or vice versa? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve had both. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. So I’m going to go into this, I’m not going to do the research. I have no idea about all this stuff. I’m just going to see how this is going to go. And then we hit it off right away, and he tried to pay me. I was like, “No, no, no. It’s in Miami. I can drive over there. I can talk about this shit all the time. I like talking about this.” And then we just built a relationship and a friendship from that. We have similar interests. And so we meet for dinner one day. Basically, he went and spoke at this conference in Miami, and he thought he was going to go talk about his new fund, and he thought he was friends with the guy, and the guy’s selling tickets and making money off his name being there. And it’s not like you’re paying speakers. And the guy, essentially, ambushed him and starts asking questions like, “How can you do business with Saudi Arabia? They chopped up Khashoggi,” and all this other stuff. And then before the talk was even done, his social media team was clipping it and sending it out in press releases and stuff. Tim Ferriss: What a mess. David Senra: So I show up at this dinner, and Jared’s always buttoned up and always got his shit together and he’s just like, “What the hell is going on here?” And by the time the dinner ends, it’s everywhere. And again, I’m like, “This is weird that the business and tech press in America, they hate business and tech. They cover things.” I’m an enthusiast. I’m not a journalist, I’m not a critic. I read books all the time where I hate the person or something. You’ll never see me do a podcast about it. I want to talk about stuff I like, not things I hate. It’s a weird thing to go through. Imagine waking up every day, and your job is to cover people that you secretly wish you were. There’s just weird stuff around this. So we had this idea at dinner. I was like, “There should be a place where…” I am not talking about sycophant. I’m saying Todd Graves, people make fun of him because he says that God made him good at chicken fingers and that he’s living a chicken finger dream he thinks is a mission. But I’ll tell you what, he believes it. He’s been offered billions. He owns over 90 percent of the company. He will never sell that company. He’s not doing it for money. He’s doing it because he wants to make money and he does a lot of great things in the community. And I think people should know this guy exists and his ideas should be spread. That’s a good for the world. So those two things happened, and I’m like, “Oh, this is interesting.” I have this weird base of knowledge. So the way Jared describes it is, he’s like, “Talking to you is like talking to 50 of history’s greatest entrepreneurs at the same time.” Because we’ll talk about something and same thing you see I do. And then Daniel’s way of saying that, he’s like, “You’re like an LLM trained on history’s greatest entrepreneurs with the temperature turned up because you’re crazy. So it makes it entertaining.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I think that’s no small contributor to why you have a die-hard fan base. It’s the pulpit preacher fervor that you bring to it. David Senra: But I didn’t understand that until I thought about my childhood. When people say they go to church, that’s not the kind of churches I went to. This really gets me sad and where I was almost crying earlier. My mom deserved a better life. She didn’t deserve to grow up with the monster of her father and frankly, the bitch that her mom was. The one thing that I remember about my mom’s mom that she said to me was that I was a faggot. That is literally the only memory I have is her — she was mentally ill. You’d go to her house, you know National Enquirer and all those things? There’s National Enquirer, there’s The Sun, and all this other stuff that you get when you go to the grocery store. First of all, she was a hoarder, so you’d go in the bathroom and there’s stacks all the way up to the — she wouldn’t throw them out. But she read them like we read The Wall Street Journal. You assume the stock is what they said the stock price is. She’d read it like, “This is true. Bigfoot is true.” I was a kid. This is the memory. I was the age when President Clinton was in the White House and she was convinced that Clinton was gay and his wife was lesbian. And so she saw conspiracy everywhere, and she would direct that at her grandchildren, which is monstrous. And so my mom deserved better. And then the problem was, my mom didn’t have an education and she was a very naive person. And so she turned to the church, but the church she turned to was — do you know who Benny Hinn is? Tim Ferriss: I do know the name. Yeah. David Senra: Okay. So you come up there and he blows on you and you don’t have leprosy anymore, or he hit you in the face, does this thing, and you can walk now. And all this stuff was acting. They caught these people over and over again. And I remember my mom didn’t have a bunch of money and her putting a couple crumpled-up dollars and giving it to them because she thought this is what she’s going to get in her life. It’s sickening to me now that that happened to her and that she fell prey to that and that these people did this and they have private jets and they have all this crazy — I’m sure there’s some people that do that and they believe it. That’s a different thing if they really believe it. I know that guy didn’t believe. Come on, you didn’t believe that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it was a racket. David Senra: But then I didn’t understand that, oh, my God, that influenced the way I make my podcast because it is like — preacher. I feel I shouldn’t be sitting at a desk. I should be sitting at a pulpit. Somebody bought the domain churchforfounders.com, and it points to my podcast. Tim Ferriss: That’s amazing. David Senra: So that’s why I’m doing it. And then the other thing was I just like podcasting and I can have a conversation every day. So we’re going to start out every other week, and then move up to every week, and then I want to be having multiple conversations a week. That’s what I want to do because I’m doing it anyways. Let’s just put a microphone there. And it’s not an interview. Yeah, there’s some questions I have for them, but it’s like a conversation. The idea that I’m going to do a business show interview and compete with Patrick, I think he’s the best interviewer by far. He’s so concise and perfect and he’s just really good at it. And I like to talk. I want to talk 49 percent of the time. Tim Ferriss: How will you balance the two shows? Because it seems like Founders podcast takes a lot as it is. David Senra: Yes. Tim Ferriss: One of the benefits of that format is — now, this might put a cap on growth to some extent, but if you’re not playing the video game, it removes a lot of complexity. You don’t necessarily need to travel. You just read. You enjoy your solitude. You do some long-form audio, you can have notes in front of you. You can be picking your nose as you take a deep breath. There’s a lot of flexibility there. How are you going to balance the two without sacrificing Founders, snuffing out the magic X when you’re working on Y? David Senra: This goes back. That’s a great question and it’s something I was very concerned with, and that’s why I said no for so many years. And so then you think if you said yes, then how would you do it instead of just blankly saying no? And there’s a secret of dealing with me that everybody that knows me for a long time realizes, anybody that’s been around me for a long time, and essentially it’s like water on a rock. This is literally going to happen multiple times. So let’s say Patrick or Sam Hinkie would be like, “I have this idea.” And immediately, I’m like, “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard.” And I’ll be really aggressive and angry. It’s like, “Stupid idea, terrible idea.” Then they mention it two weeks later, and now it’s just, “Dumb idea.” Mention it again a few weeks later, silence. Then a few weeks later, I’m like, “Hey guys, I have a great idea.” Tim Ferriss: It’s their idea. David Senra: It’s their idea. Tim Ferriss: A slow-bake. David Senra: They know. They’re just like, “Okay.” It’s just water on a rock. I’ll get to them, it’s just going to take a while. And the problem is now I’ve said that, they know that, and then you have other people that have to deal with me. I’m very difficult to deal with, obviously. You are too. And I think that’s one thing we can bond over. And you’re not trying to be mean, it’s just part of our personalities. And so the answer to your question is Founders is a one person — so I read, I research, I record, I set my own mics, I do all the editing, I hand do the transcripts, I do everything. The only thing outsourced is that I think the clip guy I have is a little genius, a young kid living in Paris. His name’s Maxim, he’s incredible. And then I have somebody now because I have to play the YouTube game, which I hate, and I refuse to do the YouTube thing. I hate it. Tim Ferriss: I haven’t. David Senra: Exactly, I won’t. Tim Ferriss: I’ve cauterized myself in that. David Senra: I won’t do that kind of shit. I’d rather not get views. I have to see something and say I would click on that myself. I’m not doing things for numbers. I didn’t even know how many people were listening to Founders until the first six years. I never looked. And then I started doing these big sponsorship deals and they’re like, “Oh, I should look.” And they’re like, “Oh, this is great.” But I don’t like thinking about numbers. I don’t want it to influence anything that I do. And so the Founders basically take seven days. Usually, I’m late on the episode. Tim Ferriss: Something in common with Dan Carlin. David Senra: Yeah. No, I’m five days late. He’s five months late. God, man. Tim Ferriss: Love you, Dan. You know that. David Senra: Yeah. He’s literally the best podcaster to ever live. So what I realized is if I was going to do this, I would need a team. And I don’t like working with other people because I’m difficult. I can be mean. I just am. And I don’t want to be mean. I really don’t. You mentioned earlier not getting some of the bad personality traits from them. And I was worried. I’ve asked friends, “Do you think I’m sociopathic? Am I all this?” They’re like, “No. You have empathy. You have a hard outer shell, but you’re really soft in the middle.” Patrick will tell you that. Tim Ferriss: Turtle. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. When I was in Japan, we went to some — what’s the ones where you have 20-course meals? Tim Ferriss: Oh, omakase. David Senra: Yeah. And they try to — Tim Ferriss: Which literally means, basically, I’ll leave it to you. Omakase is like, “Leave it to you.” So you can use it that way too, “Makaseru.” David Senra: Well, why do they call it omakase and it’s multiple — what does it have to do with — Tim Ferriss: Omakase, is you don’t pick anything à la carte. You let the chef. Sit down and they just give you what they want to give you. David Senra: Yes. And then they come in there, they make sure — Tim Ferriss: So you’re leaving it up to them. David Senra: But then they come in after everything and they want to talk to you about it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, that’s very un-Japanese. That’s probably for foreigners. David Senra: Okay. So they tried to give me — Tim Ferriss: They might be like, “This is this,” and then they stop. But this guy was giving you little mini TED Talks? David Senra: No, he tried to get me to eat essence of turtle. It was baby turtle. I was like, “I’m not eating turtle.” Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t sound great. I’m not excited about essence of turtle. David Senra: Hey, the face you just made should be the turtle face. Tim Ferriss: I feel like if David Senra doesn’t work as a podcast name, you could have Essence of Turtle. David Senra: So what I realized is I need a team. So what I could see is eventually going down. Right now I’m making a new Founders episode every 10 to 14 days, which is not good. And I’ve tried to do every week. The cadence probably should be every two weeks. Me and Rick were talking about this this morning in regards to you, the same way. What’s that old apocryphal saying? “I would’ve wrote you a short letter, but I didn’t have time so I wrote you a long one.” He says me and you share that thing where the reading’s not taking longer, the recording’s not taking longer. It’s the editing before I do anything, it’s this wieldy, 15,000-word thing. I’m trying to get down to 5,000 words. Takes so long to do. So to answer your question, could see a future — I’m never going to stop doing Founders, where I have to reduce. It can’t be 52 a year. Second and biggest thing is I took an idea from one of Rockefeller’s biographies. So one of the things that I do that I also think is important is you read all the famous biographies, but you’ve got to go through the bibliographies. Books are made out of books. Everybody has read Titan by Ron Chernow. In the bibliography of that, there’s the best Rockefeller biography I’ve ever read, and I have eight at the house I haven’t read yet. I collect obscure Rockefeller biographies that I’ll eventually get to. Tim Ferriss: What’s your favorite one? David Senra: It’s called John D: The Founding Father of the Rockefellers, by David Freeman Hawke. Tim Ferriss: Better writer than a titler. David Senra: Yes. 250 pages instead of 800, but all about what you really want to know. You don’t want to know about where his grandfather was born. You want to know how he built Standard Oil. And there’s this idea in there that I’ve used called secret allies. And so this is going to answer your other question about podcasting, where he’s at the beginning of the oil industry. It’s the very beginning and he’s there. Tim Ferriss: Rough and tumble time. David Senra: Yeah. No one knows shit about oil refining. So what does he do? He goes and builds a network of secret allies with other oil refiners and then eventually do something that’s even more nefarious, which they start something called the Oil Refiners Association of America or something. And then he gets himself elected president to that. And then what happens is, it’s like if we had a podcaster union and I’m president of the podcaster union, and then I go to you and like, “Tim, what’s your downloads this month? And how much are you charging for ads? And then who’s your next guest?” And he’s getting all this data. So then he sees, “That’s a joker. That guy’s already out of business. He doesn’t even know it yet.” Tim Ferriss: “Oh, we don’t have to worry about that guy.” David Senra: Yeah. “That guy’s a killer. I need to buy his company and make him a partner.” And so this idea of secret allies. So I’m obsessed with podcasting. And so what I would go do, I’d go around and I would talk to any podcaster who would talk to me. And we talk about everything, downloads, ads, who you’re selling to, how are you selling, who are you using for editing. Tim Ferriss: Maybe that’s the spider sense I got. David Senra: No. No, because I give. I give — Tim Ferriss: I know, I’m kidding. I’m kidding. David Senra: There’s people, literally, they’ll even tell you. There’s podcasters that literally, I took an idea from one podcast and gave it to another podcast because that’s the whole thing. I don’t collect it and hold it. We spread it around and they’ve made millions and millions of dollars from these ideas. Tim Ferriss: I have a friend named Kevin Kelly. Kevin Rose does that too. David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Just gives away. Derek Sivers does it too. Gives away as many as possible. And if he can’t get rid of one that keeps him up at night, it’s like, “All right.” David Senra: If you’re talking about podcast data, who’s the mad scientist of podcast data? Chris Hutchins. Me and you’ve talked to him. We both talked to him. He has good shit because he tells you stuff and he tells me stuff that I didn’t know. And he’s this weird mad scientist, but he’s in this weird part of podcasting I don’t even think about. Tim Ferriss: All the Hacks. People, check him out. David Senra: Yeah. He’s been on your podcast twice. Tim Ferriss: Once because he wanted to have this long conversation with me about a bunch of stuff I was doing. And I was like, “If we’re going to do that, make it good with your questions and we’ll just record it. And then I can share it because I don’t want to answer all these questions over and over again.” It was about podcasting. David Senra: It’s a great idea. And so basically, I took that idea. So anyways, I was able to build a lot of relationships with a lot of great podcasters who are friends who share information. But then you also see, “Oh, wait, there’s a lot of disparity between podcast teams and stuff.” And so Rob Mohr and Andrew Huberman tried to recruit me years ago, because they have a podcast network called SciComm that they really don’t do much with because it’s really hard to launch another health podcast when they’re dominating that vertical. Is there another Huberman in that vertical that’s not discovered? Unlikely. And power laws were everything around us. And so I got this crazy DM and then a phone call with Rob, and he’s just like, “Dude, who are you?” And this is when I had, again, 5,000 listeners. And he’s like, “I’ve never come across anything like this.” And then we wound up talking. I think every single time we talked, it was over — this is on the phone, for over two hours every time and it’s all about podcasting. And then they’re like, “We’re looking for other Hubermans, and you’re this giant nerd that loves reading obscure shit and breaking it down in an entertaining manner just like Andrew does.” And he’s like, “Would you be interested in joining us on SciComm?” And I was like, “You are two weeks too late because it’s not announced yet. But I have a verbal agreement with this guy named Patrick and I’m joining Colossus.” But we still became friends and everything else. And so basically me and Rob, we’d spent a lot of time, I spend my summers in Malibu, so I see them all the time. And I’ve talked to Andrew and they’re just killers. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re very good at what they do. David Senra: They’re just operationally excellent. And they have a small but mighty team, and every single person in that team, they’re very focused. So their photographer’s one of the best photographers. Their editor’s one of the best editors. Their video people are some of the best video people. Their internet guy’s one of the best internet guys. It’s just everything. And so their whole point was — I was like, “Listen, Founders is never going anywhere. It’s staying on Colossus. It’s staying exactly what it is. But if I do something new, I’ll let you know.” And so when I went to them, it was just like, “Here’s the thing. I am going to pick the guests. I’m highly disagreeable. I will never take direction from anybody. I want to pick the guests and I want to have the conversations. And then everything else has to be A-plus team around me. And that means from visuals, to editing, to clips, to every single thing.” And they’re operationally excellent. I have not met a better — just spend time with them. Tim Ferriss: Very well-architected. David Senra: And then the way they built their business is genius.Tim Ferriss: So what does success look like for you two years from now? Three, five, pick your time frame. David Senra: Oh, success looks the same now and forever that I’m proud of what I made. That’s it. I don’t care what the numbers are. I love the climb. Tim Ferriss: Let’s say this show does really well. David Senra: Oh, it is going to. Tim Ferriss: So David Senra does really well. And not saying Rob would do this, but you know what we would really love to do is a third show, and it’s incredibly compelling, maybe it’s a slightly different angle or a totally different angle. Who knows? Who the hell knows? Interviewing spouses of all these famous people, which I think would actually be an amazing podcast. I’m sure someone’s doing it. But besides the quality of the product and being proud of the product, there is such a thing as too many different products. David Senra: Oh, sure. Tim Ferriss: There is such a thing as simply burning the candle at both ends. So you’re at a battery capacity that compromises the product, maybe long-term or your life. You’ve got more considerations than just business. So how do you think about those other factors when you telescope out a few years? David Senra: I’m not a long-term planner. So I would say I’m basically non-analytical at all. I go straight off intuition. Steve Jobs says this great line where he thinks intuition is more important than intelligence, and that intuition played a larger role in his success than anything else. Intuition and perseverance. And so I used to think I was more analytical and I have a five-year plan, a 10-year plan. All a great life is, is a string of great days. And so the furthest I plan out is 24 hours. I actually have this weird — I don’t even know if I should say this publicly. I don’t think humans actually understand time at all. And when you say a decade, yeah, we know a decade’s 10 years. But do we actually understand what that means? I think we maybe understand a week, a month. We definitely understand a day because that’s how we live. We live 24 hours at a time. And so all I try to do is like, “Can I design a day that I really enjoyed?” And not hedonistic. I’m not laying around doing nothing. I have to work. I feel guilt and shame when I’m not being productive. And that’s probably a bad thing. There’s all reasons that you could psychoanalyze why that is the case, but I just know how I am. I like to work. I like to get up and get after it. I don’t like taking vacations. The stuff I get invited to is crazy. I like to work. I like podcasting. I’m obsessed with it. Everybody’s like, “We talked about this multiple times. Why don’t you do something else?” I like doing this. I will keep doing this. So to answer your question, I just try to make a great day. And the way I make a great day is I want to wake up, I want to take care of my health. I want to read. I want to make a product I’m really proud of and I want to spend time with people that I love and admire. And I’m going to do that the next day and the next day and the next day. And I think if I have a great day today and a great day tomorrow and a shitty day a month from now and then a better day the next day and I get through my life and it’s just a string of great days, that will be a great life. And so two years from now, I don’t know because if you asked me two years ago, I said, “There’s no way I’m going to do another podcast.” But I would say my answer is that simple. The maxim I like about this is I love the climb. I don’t care where the summit is. I just like the activity for the sake of itself, and so therefore, I’m going to do it. And I hope it’s well-received. But I couldn’t have predicted that Founders was going to turn out the way it was. So I don’t know. I’m just going to do great work that I’m completely fascinated by and it gives me energy. And on the other side of that, this is what Stephen King said, “I’m not just the writer. I’m the first reader.” I listen to every single episode of Founders before anybody else and I just threw out one. The book is great, Bill Walsh’s The Score Takes Care of Itself. I read it for the first time five, six years ago. I read it again. Love the book. I made a podcast on it. It’s an hour and 15 minutes long. I finished editing it. I listened to it, not good enough, threw it away. That’s it. Can I make something that I’m proud of? Tim Ferriss: So I believe all of that and I want to push on a little bit. David Senra: Go for it, please. Tim Ferriss: Because the great days make great lives, I agree with. But now your circle of interaction is expanding with a show that involves other people with very busy schedules. So to what extent are you going to be traveling to all these people versus having people travel to you? That type of decision has longer-term implications, right? So I’m curious how you think about that. David Senra: So the way I think about this is this goes to the other side of me that’s probably not healthy, that I have a ruthless competitive drive that I think would terrify most people. I have a very negative inner monologue that I never think I’m doing enough. I have multiple people depending on me financially, way above and beyond just your wife and kids, other people that I have to make sure that I can take care of, so I have a lot of pressure on me. I want the pressure. So, to answer your question, it’s like I’ll do whatever it takes to win. And so, if that means I’ve got to get on a plane, or I get a little less sleep, then that’s what’s going to happen. But I also think you’re also smart, and you can think about these things, like okay, you want to talk to extreme winners in business, is essentially — not really starter/founders, I want people that have decades of experience. Every single person, if you look at the people that we’ve been recording with so long, I’m just more interested in talking to people that have done things for a long time, that are smarter and more productive and better than I am. And so, setting up here, where we are in New York, is probably a good idea because everybody comes through New York. Now, we’ve recorded several in L.A., here’s also a thing to consider, most of the people I’m talking to have planes. Rick pulls me aside and says this all the time, multiple people have told me this, you don’t understand the impact that you’re having on people, because I don’t think about it. I’m by myself all the time, I don’t look at numbers. And so, people have literally gotten their jets and flown across the country because I was like, “Hey, can you do it on this day in L.A.? Are the teams there? It’s more convenient.” And they do it because they think I’ve done something for them, but I’m just like, “No, no, no, I haven’t done anything for you, I just thank you for listening. The fact that you listen to my podcast means I get to do this for a living.” This is more Munger has really heavily basically influenced my thinking, it’s just like the reciprocation tendency in humans is so pronounced and it’s evolved. Yes, and it’s never going away, and what I didn’t understand and I still don’t understand, because I don’t like talking about, I don’t like thinking about this shit. I think about, like, as if I’m talking to one person is the fact that so many people have gotten value. Every single person’s recorded an episode with us for the new show so far has listened to a ton of shows of mine. And their point was it’s important work, and it’s more — Todd Graves has actually told me this two weeks ago. He’s like, “It’s important work and it’s more important the bigger your company gets.” Because if I can hear a single idea, or either avoid a mistake or get a good idea — Tim Ferriss: That’s true. David Senra: — and it makes a one percent difference on my business, that’s — I can’t do math, I can’t do public math. A billion dollars, whatever the number is, $2 billion. It’s a huge — no, that’d be 10 percent. So, if it makes a 10 percent difference in his business, it’s a huge swing. And so, so far, and again, you have a private jet, where do you actually live? Wherever you have to — Tim Ferriss: Also, your carrying costs for that jet are pretty high. David Senra: Yeah, so I — Tim Ferriss: So, there’s a little bit of pressure just to utilize the damn thing. David Senra: You want to hear something funny? I’ll go back to why I think New York and L.A. is going to be where I’m recording most of these. And we’re willing to travel, we will if we have to. If Dyson says, “Come do it,” I’m coming to England, I don’t give a shit. So, Sam Zell told me, he’s like, “I told you that lunch I had with him changed my life?” He’s like, “Don’t make the same mistake,” he’s like, “I know all the rich guys,” and he says, “first of all, they’re all guys…” That’s what he told me. He goes, “Two, you’d be surprised how many of them are miserable. And they do stuff they don’t like for more money that they can’t spend, and then they make the same mistake, where they buy slight…” This is his word, it’s not mine. He goes, “they buy slightly nicer versions of the same shit.” He goes, “The difference between a $10 million house and a 30 million house is negligible.” And he’s like, “I own my place in Chicago, and my compound in Malibu,” that’s the word he used, compound. And he goes, “I rent everything else.” He goes, “The things that you own start to own you.” And he said every year, after, I think, Thanksgiving and in between Christmas, he’d take his entire family, extended family, to this little village in France. And he said, he’s always a shit talker. And he said funny things, he goes, “I could buy the whole village.” He goes, “I don’t, I rent it, and then I don’t think about it until I go back. It’s somebody else’s problem.” And he goes, “There’s only one true luxury in life,” he goes, “it’s a private jet, try to get to private jet money.” And he is like, “I use my jet three hours a day.” On average, he uses jet three hours a day. He was in South Florida, because he’s like, “I woke up in Chicago this morning, I got on my jet, I went across the street, gave a talk to a bunch of investors and entrepreneurs,” because that’s what he wanted to spend his last days doing. He knew he was dying, he didn’t tell me though, I didn’t know that. We were scheduled to have another dinner, and it got canceled and they said he was sick, I was like, oh, he got COVID. He died three weeks later, so I never got to see him again. But the way he was spending his last days, at his own expense, traveling all over the world on his beautiful giant plane, spending a lot of money, is passing on the knowledge that he learned through 61 years to other investors and younger and entrepreneurs. And so he goes, “I did that this morning, came over here, had lunch, I’m going to get in my car, and go back to Chicago.” He used it three hours a day. So, so far people have been willing to fly to come to us, I’ll come to some people if they’re super busy schedules, and then I think just setting up in a place where they all will come through would make a lot of sense. Tim Ferriss: Anyone on your wish list that you haven’t been able to track down? David Senra: No, surprisingly, again, I don’t like thinking about this, where I don’t understand that today, right now, if I do an episode on somebody living, it’s going to get to them. They might not be a listener, but — this just happened with Jimmy Iovine. So I have these weird, people are always surprised, they think, who’s on your list? Obviously I respect Bezos, respect Elon, all of them, but I would say like Todd Graves, they’re like, “What the hell’s wrong with you? And James Dyson. The vacuum cleaner guy?” I’m weirdly obsessed with these people. And so, one of the people I’m obsessed with is Jimmy Iovine. And Jimmy Iovine, Defiant Ones. Tim Ferriss: Such a good series. David Senra: I watch it — Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God, it is so well done. If anyone hasn’t seen Defiant Ones, go watch it. It’s head spinningly good. David Senra: With the description of the four-part documentaries, oh, it’s a relationship between Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. Yeah, it’s really a documentary about entrepreneurship, it’s about chasing a path — chasing a path, there’s no path in front of you. There was no path for Dre to get out of Compton, there’s no path from Jimmy to get, for the son of a longshoreman in Brooklyn, to go what happened to him. He’s fascinating. And then this is my point about what do you actually value in life? Jimmy’s a billionaire. I don’t know, he’s got a billion, $2 billion, whatever the case is, I’d be more interested in that than if he had $100 billion. If you asked me whose life would you want, Buffett or Munger, Buffett was 100 times richer, I’m taking Munger every day. What I like about Jimmy is that he lived an interesting life. The episode, you see it on Defiant Ones, crazy stories in there, but Rick Rubin, who, you mentioned, if podcasting is saturated, which we can get to, Rick Rubin’s really good because he’s a world-class listener. He took a skillset, what was his skill for the work that he did? Why are these musicians hiring him? To listen, to hear something they don’t hear, and to suggest something they might not hear, might not understand. And the episode he did with Jimmy Iovine I think came out in 2023, I think it was the single best podcast I listened to all year. And it’s just Jimmy Iovine telling insane story after insane story about the music business, because the music business is a wild business. And what I like about my business is that it’s a unique experience generator. It creates opportunities and experiences you can’t buy, and the amount of people I get to meet and talk to — my memoirs are going to be wild because of the weird dinners I’ve been to, and the planes I’ve been on, and the boats I’ve been on, and it started because I was a giant nerd, with a giant head, sitting in a room by himself for five years, just mainlining biography after biography after biography. Jimmy’s really interesting to me, and then what happened is, I don’t even — part of this, I can’t tell you how I got connected, he agreed to do the show, and one of the previous guests is the one that connected me, which again, I just don’t feel I deserve how nice these people have been to me and what they’re willing to do, and I don’t even like asking them for this. But it got to Jimmy — Tim Ferriss: Is that true? David Senra: No, I don’t like — the worst possible — Tim Ferriss: You put a lot of work into your podcast. David Senra: It doesn’t matter though, the worst possible thing — Buffett has — Tim Ferriss: Do you feel like you don’t deserve it? I feel like that’s an important question. David Senra: Buffett has a — I’ll answer that question in a minute. Buffett has the line’s, it’s like, “The people that win are the ones that their eyes are on the field, not the scoreboard.” I don’t — I was going for a walk last night, and you know this happens to you all time, I’m way earlier, you’re like an OG, man, you’ve been famous way — I still, when people stop me on the street, which happens, I’m like, “How do you know what I look like?” Tim Ferriss: No, that’s going to happen more and more. David Senra: Yeah, exactly. So, I’ve read all your blog posts about this too. I was on the phone with Morgan Housel this morning, who’s a big fan of yours. Tim Ferriss: Great guy. David Senra: Obviously you guys are friends. And we were talking about that, security around this, and all this other stuff, and then we were talking about you. Morgan’s just a peach of a human, he’s the opposite of me. Tim Ferriss: Psychology of Money, great book. David Senra: It won’t stop selling, won’t stop selling. Tim Ferriss: I know. Yeah. Got lightning in a bottle on that one. Yeah. Earned it. Earned it too. David Senra: Oh, 100 percent. And the nicest guy. If you think you want to find my directional opposite, and we’ll go back to the question you think is important, Morgan genuinely believes that his ceiling that he should have — he should be an insurance salesman somewhere in the Midwest, making 100,000 a year. And the fact that this guy got really, really wealthy — Tim Ferriss: Astronomical numbers. David Senra: Yes. Really, really wealthy, and just wakes up every day, can’t believe his life. I wake up every day like, “Why am I not a billionaire?” It’s like, he’s happy in a way I will never be, and this is why I think Daniel Ek’s advice about chasing — Daniel does not believe, this is one of the first things I asked him on the show, was — he was the one that put this idea out there that life is not about happiness, it’s about impact. He is not chasing happiness, he’s chasing impact. And he’s the one that actually convinced Dara, the founder of Uber, tells the story, they were having drinks — Tim Ferriss: Dara is CEO. David Senra: CEO. Yeah, sorry. Good distinction. I met Travis too. Most intense person I’ve ever been in contact with. Tim Ferriss: He is one hell of a builder, man. David Senra: Oh, for sure. Tim Ferriss: And different batteries. David Senra: Most intense. And I’ve been around a lot of intense, he is — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. He’s — David Senra: Very fascinating. Tim Ferriss: — he has different gears than most people. David Senra: Oh, and the storytelling, and the — he’s a phenomenal storyteller, phenomenal communicator. So, anyways, when Dara was going back and forth about becoming CEO of Uber, he said originally was going to say no because he was pretty happy with his life, and Daniel, in a very direct way, was like, “When’s life about happiness? It’s about impact. It’s like one of the most important companies in the world, and you can have an impact on it. You can have an impact on the way cities are changed. You absolutely have to do this.” And I think that’s a really interesting idea. So, I am trying to have impact. So, to answer your question, do I think I deserve it? I obviously know that I put a lot of work into it, and I believe that the product is good, and I think I found what I’ve put on the planet to do, but I don’t like thinking about it. I don’t like thinking about its impact on other people. I like it because I like it. I make it, I’m like, I would listen to this podcast, I think it’s valuable. I think you start doing shit for the wrong reasons — I talked to a lot of the head people at Spotify, and they said the biggest mistake, one of the biggest mistakes they made is the great thing about podcasting is that people that come up like we did, through the garage. You just started — I listened to your first episode. I remember TimTim TalkTalk. Tim Ferriss: TimTim Talk. David Senra: Yeah, I remember. Tim Ferriss: From my kitchen table. David Senra: With a friend. And why did you do it? I think you had a couple glasses of wine, right? And with a friend, because you’re like, I don’t — Tim Ferriss: Figured it out pretty quickly after listening to episode one that the second episode was going to be sober. David Senra: Oh, man. Tim Ferriss: Josh Waitzkin, number two. David Senra: Yeah. But you come up with, you did it because you were curious, you only talked to people you really want to talk to, you had no production costs. And so, Spotify said they flipped it. They’re like, we took something that was low production costs done by enthusiasts and people in the garage. Huberman’s analogy of this is, it’s punk rock. Punk rock is great because it started with people that just wanted to play in the garage, and then they got good, and then they played for stadiums. And so, Spotify’s like, oh, what we did was we took a low production cost, made a high production cost because we had these big contracts, and then we hired celebrities, and no one listened, and the people that did listen, they stopped because the celebrities were just doing it for money, they didn’t do it because they love it. And I think that’s the key. It’s like, I truly love this, I did it for five and a half years when no one was listening. That tells you that I love it. But I think one of the worst things you could do is, I’m going to do it because status is the funny thing. Podcasting is dorky, it’s low status. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. David Senra: In 2016, you think that was fucking high status? Tim Ferriss: No. David Senra: No. It was like, “You dorky nerd with a podcast.” Tim Ferriss: And to be clear, I’m not asking if you’re seeking status, it was more if you feel that you’re unworthy of people flying to you and doing these things, those are two very different — David Senra: No, yeah, I meant I think you see this now, that podcasting is obviously very influential and can be — there’s so many people jumping into it that clearly don’t love it. They like it because the CPMs are high or whatever, or they want to be famous. I had no video for eight years, do you think I want to be famous? Do you think I want to be recognized? No, I obviously don’t. I had to fucking had the most powerful person in podcasting berate me at dinner, in a nice way, saying, you idiot, you have to do video. That’s the only reason I do video because Daniel told me to. And how smart am I if I don’t listen to him? Then I’m an idiot. I have to do it. I don’t like doing it. So, I don’t know, man. I don’t know. I think at some point the platform gets big enough, like, “I flew here for this. Why? Because you have a massive platform, and you’re willing to extend it to me, and I’d travel wherever. You say. Iceland? I’m coming to Iceland, brother. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, I knew you like Argentina, let’s go down there. We’ll do an Argentina. So, yeah, I think eventually, when they see it’s big enough, that people would come to you, also try to make it easier, and I’m not doing it in Columbia, Missouri, I’m doing it in New York or L.A., you’re going to be there anyways.” Tim Ferriss: And also with the particular cohort that you’re interviewing with jets, if they’re like, “Sure, I’ll fly to New York,” and then they can also set up five other meetings with friends or business associates, or fill in the blank. David Senra: Make it easy. But I think really, man, I do this — I don’t, this is the turtle in me. I don’t like asking. Tim Ferriss: This is the turtle. David Senra: You can ask all the people that — we have a bunch of mutual close friends, I don’t like asking for help. And I think one of the weird ways that I think I built true friendships with some of these people is because all day long it’s, give me, give me, give me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: I have never asked Rick for anything. I think one time to crash at his house, that’s it. All I want is to be homies, to be friends. I don’t want anything from this. And I think I didn’t understand because I didn’t come from this background, that when you’re high profile, and you’re building these empires, these are all empire builders. All day long they’re just surrounded by people that want something from them. And I’m just like, here, I have this podcast that might be valuable for you, you want it? I don’t want anything from you. And when they tell me, ask me for stuff, I still don’t like doing it. I don’t like doing it. It really hurt me to, would you be on my show? But I was like, all right, well, if I’m going to ask for something, I’ll do this. And not a single person I’ve asked has said no. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you love what you do, that is essential to producing the quality that you produce. It’s essential for the endurance to sort of outperform and outlast, because podcasting as a whole is just an elephant graveyard of three to 10 episode shows. So, if you choose something you really like, that you would make because you intrinsically enjoy it, if it’s an outgrowth of reading the biographies, taking the notes, and you’re like, well, this is really sort of in terms of additional work for me on top of something I might already be doing, actually not like the majority of the pie, and you have the fuel of that obsession you’re going to do well, even if it’s just for yourself, but certainly with the longevity you have the competitive advantage of durability. David Senra: That means a lot coming from you, and everything you’ve accomplished, and I think you actually hit to the essence of it, where it’s like, I can’t sleep after these things. I had to get up the next day when I was in Austin, I think I had a 7:00 a.m. flight, and I slept maybe three hours because just gem after gem after gem from Michael Dell. Or you’ll see this on the Todd Graves episode, dude, we were the same person. We’re the same person. And so, we’re spontaneously high-fiving — I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of, “This guy’s a dork.” Like, “Hey, give me another high-five, buddy.” We were just geeking out about minute details of just being obsessed with, his whole thing is do one thing and doing it better than anybody else. And I remember going from the airport, it was in Baton Rouge, and I immediately called Sam, who’s the closest thing I have to a mentor, and I was like, “I’m in trouble,” and he’s like, “Why?” I go, “I’m addicted to doing these things already, I can’t stop.” This was crazy. Tim Ferriss: It’s a good sign. David Senra: Crazy. Tim Ferriss: That’s how I pick my projects, largely, it’s how I pick some of my startups too that I get involved with. If I have what I would call good insomnia, for at least a few nights in a given week, and then I try to quell it, it doesn’t matter how much Trazodone I take, or anything else, I just am so excited by something that my mind is worrying and I can’t go to sleep, I’m like, okay, there’s probably something there. Also because it seems to be such an energetic unlock, I’m like, even if that one thing doesn’t do very well, if I can create this nuclear power from that, it’s not compartmentalized, it can apply to other things. So, I get it. I get it. Now, I was listening to, I don’t know how I found it — actually, I was going on, I think it’s Tom Papa’s show. He’s a comedian, great interviewer, and I was going on his show, this is a while ago, and I was doing some homework on my own, listened to an interview he did where he interviewed Joe Rogan. And I’m paraphrasing here obviously, but Rogan effectively said, he’s like, “Yeah, I don’t really think much about discipline or willpower,” he said, “what I do have though is obsession. And when I find something that I’m obsessed with, when I deep dive, it’s like I don’t need to worry about discipline. I don’t need to worry about willpower.” So, it’s like finding that thing that you are obsessed by. David Senra: I think 100 percent right. Tim Ferriss: And so I think you’ve done that. You’ve done that. So, you’ve found your lane. A lot of people don’t find it, right? They don’t find that thing. It’s like you wonder if Kobe Bryant were born somewhere and didn’t have the chance to pick up basketball, would it have been something else? Maybe if you were Michael Jordan, okay, it’s baseball or this or that, but it’s like, you found your thing, that’s kind of amazing. David Senra: No, I appreciate it. And the way I think about it’s, it took me 32 years to find my path, and five and a half years of struggle before I could even pay my bills. It was a long time. Kobe found it — imagine finding it at 12 like he did, and knowing. I read the 600-page biography on him by Roland Lazenby. And the middle school guidance counselor is like, he wrote down, “What are you going to do?” He’s like, “I’m going to play in the NBA.” He’s like, “You need to pick something else, that’s a one in a million shot.” He goes, “I’m going to be that one in a million.” To be that so sure at 12 years old, and this is what goes back to the lack of introspection. I had a lot of angst, and what is the meaning of life, or what am I doing here? And then once you find your thing, there’s like a, definitely not resting on laurels, but there is almost a relief, like — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: Because it’s not just finding something you love to do, it’s like, what is that — you’re like a Japanese encyclopedia. Ikigai, what is the — Tim Ferriss: Ikigai, yeah. David Senra: Yeah, it’s like the intersection of what you love to do, what you’re good at, and what’s good for the world. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. Ikigai gets used in a bunch of different ways. Japan’s always good for these pithy, conceptual words. David Senra: I think, I’m just going to be blasphemous for you, but I think travel is generally overrated, after you do it — Tim Ferriss: I am not jumping in — David Senra: — after you do it for a while. Because the problem is we keep going to all the nice places, and all the nice places are all the same to each other. The one thing that Japan blew my mind and why it’s the top of my list now of everywhere I’ve been, and where I’d want to go again is because it’s one of the few truly distinct cultures in the world. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a wild one. They also, they’re kind of like a chameleon, because they pull so much from other cultures. So, when it was in isolation, it was certainly an alien environment, and then you look at everything they’ve incorporated, and in some cases, in the case of, say, The Toyota Way, right? David Senra: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You have, I guess it was, I want to say Deming? David Senra: Yep. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right. Who was basically, not ignored, but certainly not embraced in his country of birth, gets adopted by the Japanese, and you see them do this over and over and over again. So, yes, it’s a fascinating place, and I would agree with you that especially people who travel in the lap of, it doesn’t need to be luxury, it could just be comfort — like rich person travel is the most boring shit in the world. David Senra: Same stores, same — Tim Ferriss: It’s just like, okay, you’re going to the Four Seasons in 12 different places, getting on the Wi-Fi, doing whatever it is you would’ve been doing at home, and then going to the most expensive meals, it’s just not interesting. So, I think if anybody wants a great book on the art of long-term world travel, if that’s of interest, Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. David Senra: I read that because of you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. David Senra: The amount of books in my library because of you. I did the same thing with you that I did with all these other people, it’s like, oh, Tim says to read it, I read it.Tim Ferriss: And a lot of these books, they’re underneath it all, at least in the case of Rolf Potts’ book, Vagabonding, they’re really philosophical operating systems, and it’s a hat you can try on. You don’t have to wear it forever, but it’s like, okay, if you only have one jacket to wear, which is six gear workaholic, neglecting family guy, just expand your wardrobe. You can always put that jacket back on, you just hang it up for a moment. And similarly, I like these books, and they certainly can be business books, whether it’s Branson, who is in some ways, he took risks, but he’s kind of the opposite, at least in a lot of capacities to a Dyson. He risk mitigates the hell out of his ventures, and caps the downside in so many creative ways. David Senra: Like his airline. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. So, the artistry of deal making for minimizing or capping downside is one of Branson’s superpowers. Even though the stuff on the magazine covers back in the day, it was like, the mad man, who’s doing X, Y, Z, and has the models, and he’s — David Senra: Phenomenal marketer. Tim Ferriss: — and he’s kite boarding with a naked model on his back. You remember that? David Senra: That’s literally the picture I have in my mind. Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God. David Senra: That looks fun. Tim Ferriss: He is also, can be a wild man. But I digress. I was just going to say that these are hats that you can put on to test them out as philosophical operating systems, which is how I pick a lot of the books. Yeah. Books, books, books. I was very similar to you when I was a kid, and also all throughout, just living in books, living and living in books, and — David Senra: It’s very common though in these stories. Rockefeller, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Edwin Land, Winston Churchill — the way I say this is like they don’t just read, they devour entire shelves. There’s multiple examples of Thomas Edison, Thomas Edison read every single book in the Detroit library. Edwin Land read every single book on light in Harvard, then dropped out because he didn’t think he had anything else to learn, moves to New York City, I think one of the most beautiful buildings is the one we passed on the way here, the New York City Public Library, read every single book on light in there, and then is like, okay, I learned enough, now I can do my experiments.

Title: TikTok finally cut a deal, but there's still plenty of uncertainty about what comes next

Time Published: 2025-09-26T15:05:21Z

Good morning to everyone except the European Ryder Cup team! The biennial (that means every two years) golf tournament between the US and Europe tees off this morning right in NYC's backyard on Long Island. BI's Alice Tecotzky will be our boots on the ground today, so if you'll be at Bethpage, drop her a line. In other news, Amazon reached a record $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC to resolve a case over its Prime subscription practices, which were first reported on by Business Insider back in 2022. In today's big story, President Donald Trump approved a TikTok deal, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions. What's on deck: Markets: A quantum leap in trading just took place. Tech: The vibes on vibe coding are not great. Business: Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol is taking a page from his old playbook to overhaul the coffee giant. But first, TikTok's no longer on the clock. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. We've finally got a TikTok deal. The specifics of it are another question. President Donald Trump signed an executive order blessing TikTok's sale for roughly $14 billion, writes BI's Dan Whateley. The deal ends the threat of the divest-or-ban law hanging over the app's head since the beginning of the year. TikTok's new US era doesn't mean the questions surrounding its future will stop. In fact, Trump's executive order led to many more questions. One big one is who exactly is getting TikTok. While it will be a consortium of investors, the exact makeup of the group wasn't disclosed. Trump said "four or five world-class investors" are involved, including Michael Dell, Rupert Murdoch, and Larry Ellison. Oracle will also audit TikTok's all-important algorithm, according to an earlier statement from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. "What this deal ensures is that the American entity, the American investors, will actually control the algorithm," Vice President JD Vance said. Theoretically, TikTok users shouldn't expect any initial significant changes to their app. After all, the whole point of the deal was to keep things running smoothly, albeit in US control. But down the road, all bets are off. Here are three big questions that remain: What's going to happen to the algorithm? The app's powerful algorithm is the most valuable piece of TikTok and was a key factor in the divest-or-ban law. But with TikTok's split from parent company ByteDance, it's not entirely clear what the impact will be. Leavitt previously said the algorithm will be "retrained." Could users experience a downgrade in performance as a result? It's all happening as Instagram leans even harder into its short-form video. How about that equity? Another complexity from the TikTok-ByteDance split is what happens to US employees' equity in the latter. ByteDance valued itself at $330 billion in late August, according to one report. TikTok US, meanwhile, is being priced at around $14 billion for the deal, according to Vance. One group that's not worried about equity is the US government. Unlike other transactions it has been involved in, Uncle Sam won't take a stake in TikTok. Instead, it expects to receive a fee for brokering the deal. Where do things go on the business side? Following the announcement, some TikTok employees told BI they were concerned about whether their teams would be deprioritized or cut entirely. One area to watch is TikTok's e-commerce business, Shop. In recent years, TikTok has heavily invested in this area. However, things haven't been going according to plan. Social shopping hasn't been embraced by the US market like it has in Asia. Further complicating things is TikTok's recent promotion of Chinese executives to lead the business, which could be called into question as it looks to distance the company from China. 1. HSBC just achieved a major breakthrough in trading, and IBM played a key role. The bank successfully used IBM's technology to deploy a quantum computing-enabled strategy in the bond market. It's a sign of what the future of trading could look like by leveraging the cutting-edge tech. 2. There's stagflationary risk on the horizon. Macro research firm TS Lombard pointed out four reasons why the US could be headed for a dreaded stagflation scenario. It compared today's risks to the last stagflation crisis of the 1960s, when Fed policy missteps caused inflation to spike while economic growth stalled. 3. Qube is humanizing its quant hedge fund. The $34 billion firm is launching its first human fundamental analyst team on October 1, people close to the firm told BI. Under former Balyasny exec Stephen Irvine, each analyst will run a sleeve of capital between $200 million and $500 million. 1. Silicon Valley's defense of Trump's new visa fee. While Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee drew backlash from many in the tech industry, leaders like Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are making the case for it. Here's why. 2. There's a new battle in the war between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. In its latest iteration, Elon Musk's xAI has sued OpenAI, alleging that the company poached xAI staff to access trade secrets. An OpenAI spokesperson denied the allegations. "This new lawsuit is the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment," the OpenAI spokesperson told BI. 3. Vibe coding isn't dead, just … sleepy? New data from Barclays shows traffic on AI vibe coding sites, including favorites Lovable and Vercel's v0, is down from a summer peak. That raises questions about whether vibe coding is dead or just in a lull as the hype burns off. 1. A farewell to Starbs. Layoffs and store closures are coming to Starbucks, which said it's firing 900 non-retail employees and shuttering about 1% of its North American stores. That includes the iconic Capital Hill Roastery, which is just minutes from its Seattle headquarters. Here's how CEO Brian Niccol is repeating his Chipotle strategy at the coffee giant. 2. Another W for Costco. The wholesaler beat expectations with full-year revenue growth of 8.1%. Its bet on extended hours for executive members is paying off — CEO Ron Vachris said those hours have added an estimated 1% to weekly sales. 3. Hustling from MTV to the trading floor. Kim Stolz started out on "America's Next Top Model" before her career at MTV. Today, she advises ultrawealthy clients at Bank of America Private Bank. Stolz shared with BI how she knocked on doors to land her first gig on Wall Street. The former Netflix exec who oversaw 'Stranger Things' and 'Bridgerton' is becoming Amazon's new TV head. Read the memo. Uber is making new moves in the race to deliver fresh groceries fast. Cisco exec says the slowdown in entry-level hiring is a 'total blip' and won't last. JPMorgan flags 3 stocks with the ingredients for a short squeeze. Miami tops UBS' list of global cities at risk of a real estate bubble. Here's how other major US markets stack up.

Opportunities for the future market lie in overall technological advancements, eco-friendly solutions, and increased adoption of integrated pest management products, and the movement toward precision agriculture, making nematicides an integral part of modern crop protection and food security. Increasing Use of Nematicides for Crop Protection and Yield Improvement As agriculture becomes more intense and widespread, monoculture grows, nematode pressure increases, encouraging more chemical and biological nematicides use as first-line protection. Farmers across the globe are adopting nematicides as a part of their integrated crop management system to protect their yields and gain profit. The difference between treated and untreated plots is perfectly evident in high nematode environments. Research in South Africa from the National Library of Medicine, conducted from 2005 to 2011, reported average yield increases of 34% for the nematicide treatments, with yield increases as high as 367% in heavily nematode-affected soils. This research demonstrates the impact of the nematicide on growers as a critical input in commercial operations and smaller-scale farmers, divorcing all while government impacts over older products, such as Telone, produce a succession of re-regulatory measures in the near future. The United Nations approximates global population growth by nearly 2 billion during the next thirty years, from 8 billion in 2022 to 9.7 billion in 2050, and will peak in 2100 at nearly 10.4 billion. With a rise in the global population and the demand for food, agriculturists worldwide are focusing on modifying farming practices to obtain high crop yields from smaller cultivation areas. Consequently, increasing crop yields and ensuring they are protected properly is a top priority within agriculture, emphasizing the ongoing need for nematicides. The use of nematicides is not only reserved for global staple crops like corn, wheat, and rice. Farmers growing fruits, vegetables, cotton, and specialty crops rely on nematicides to produce a quality product with a profitable yield. Nematicides, particularly the newer bio-based products and reduced-risk nematicides, have gotten higher marks for effectiveness because they can target multiple nematode species and support environmental sustainability. As regulatory agencies are keener to enforce rules on traditional pesticides, there are opportunities to offer nematicides that are safer, more targeted products, and have little off-target and residual issues. Integrated pest management (IPM) programs also improve the utility of nematicides. Growers combine nematicides with improving practices such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, and soil health practices to build a more resilient farming system. Increased education and outreach efforts through agricultural associations and universities have raised awareness about nematodes, identification, and control, and have created even more demand for more modern nematicides. Surging Prevalence of Nematodes Drives Nematicides Market Growth As plant breeders and researchers incorporate natural or engineered resistance genes into important crops, growers depend on varieties that can withstand nematode attack without chemical treatment. This shift reduces reliance on nematicides, especially in regions or crop sectors where such resistance is highly effective and sustainable. The proliferation of nematode-resistant cultivars has been particularly transformative in several crops. Introducing the Mi gene from wild tomato into commercial tomato varieties delivers strong resistance to multiple root-knot nematode species. It has allowed large-scale tomato growers—especially in North Carolina, where up to 97% of the tobacco crop is planted using varieties resistant to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)—to reduce or even eliminate nematicide use. Likewise, resistance genes in potato, soybean, and sugar beet reduce the need for nematicides by providing the plants with natural protection from cyst nematodes and other important pests. However, there are challenges regarding consistently using resistant cultivars. The use of resistance genes does put selection pressure on nematode populations, leading to some risk of cows emerging with resistance genes that once worked, especially certain cyst nematodes of potato and soybean crops. Regardless, the bottom line is this: resistance shifts and farm markets move to using resistant varieties, and nematicide sales become stable or decrease in those crops. For instance, after the broad adoption of cyst nematode-resistant soybean varieties in the US, the use of nematicides in soybean diminished drastically. Similar patterns are seen in other crops. These crop advancements make nematicides less central to integrated pest management, especially where resistance is durable and widely deployed. Get Research Sample Copy of the Nematicides Market: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00021800 Geographical Insights According to the nematicides market analysis, Asia Pacific led the market in 2024, capturing the highest revenue share. This was attributed to the region's high-volume agricultural production, the increasing prevalence of high-yield crops, and progressive agricultural policies that foster sustainable agriculture. Additionally, the nematicide markets in North America and Europe also grew steadily due to the increasing adoption of precision agricultural practices, mulch technologies, and better nematicide solutions. Future estimates of the nematicides market reveal that the Asia Pacific will have the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) as agricultural production grows and the trend towards precision farming expands. Nematode-driven crop losses are becoming increasingly understood, particularly in countries such as China and India. This expected increase depicts a geographical change in market momentum, creating opportunities for nematicide manufacturers to expand operations within a given region and develop partnerships and affiliations. Market Segmentation Competitive Landscape and Major Developments Global Headlines on Nematicides i) Nufarm has introduced the new microbiological nematicide Evolvance at the Tecnoshow COMIGO 2025. Evolvance is a biological product for controlling nematodes in crops, such as beans, cotton, and maize, described by Nufarm as 'innovative'. It acts by building plant roots, which promote uniform growth during the early stages of growth, and provide a positive yield near the end of harvest. ii) Corteva Agriscience has launched an innovative approach to controlling plant-parasitic nematodes called Reklemel active. Plant-parasitic nematodes are small organisms that exist in soil and cause damage to a plant's roots. In fact, plant-parasitic nematodes represent a challenge to global food security, costing more than US$80 billion dollars a year in damages. Corteva has invested over ten years in the development of Reklemel active to protect various food crops and row crops from nematode damage while maintaining beneficial organisms in the soil. Get Premium Copy of Nematicides Market Size and Growth Report by 2031 at: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/buy/TIPRE00021800 Conclusion With global agricultural production on the rise and food security pressures and world food price levels rising, crop protection companies are under increased pressure to increase and improve their level of innovation. The demand for a larger-scale procurement of new, high-performing, and environmentally friendly nematicides is increasing, in turn driving activity across the wider nematicides supply chain. A growing supplier base of nematicides has increased farmers' choice, competitive pricing, and reduced lead times. All of these have positively impacted farmers' collective bargaining power, which is expected to continue through 2031. Simultaneously, the intensity of competition in the nematicides market has never been greater. A large number of nematicide companies, divided across geographies, are competing for market share based on the quality of their nematicide products, efficacy profiles, pricing, and delivery.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Costco (NASDAQ: COST) completed fiscal 2025 (August fiscal year) with a solid quarter, slightly surpassing expectations and highlighting the strengths that distinguish it. Its Q4 earnings of $5.87 per share, a rise of 11% year-over-year, on $86.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 8%, exceeded forecasts. U.S. comparable sales increased by 5.1%, outpacing Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.6% and significantly surpassing Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 1.9% decline, underscoring the attractiveness of the warehouse model and indicating resilient traffic and consistent member spending. However, U.S. comp sales have gradually weakened—from 8.3% in Q2 to 6.6% in Q3 and 5.1% in Q4—suggesting a slowdown in domestic growth. COST shares have increased by roughly 180% over five years but have underperformed the market this year, rising only 3% against the S&P 500’s 12% increase. Also see, Buy or Sell Costco Stock? Digital growth was particularly notable in Q4: e-commerce sales rose by 13.6%, broadening Costco’s reach beyond its physical stores. Membership income—the high-margin profit generator—increased by 14% to $1.7 billion, highlighting the stickiness of its subscription model. At first glance, it presents a retail dream. But here’s the caveat. Costco is trading at 52x earnings and 57x free cash flow, indicating a meager 1.8% cash flow yield. For comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which exhibits more rapid top-line growth and has exposure to high-margin areas such as cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. Costco may possess scale, strategy, and market favor—but it carries a high price tag. Even with a solid Q4, escalating costs due to inflation, tariffs, and labor suggest that investors may focus more on Costco’s future outlook than on the quarterly results. Unlike many of its competitors, the company does not provide a full-year forecast, making the stock more responsive to any forward-looking commentary. Additionally, check Qualcomm Stock To 2x? Costco is priced for perfection, and even minor slowdowns can lead to turbulence. For context, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares fell nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the early 2020 Covid-19 panic, and 32% in the inflation-driven decline of 2022. Investors should consider this historical context, even as the current fundamentals appear robust. For those seeking lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative—having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Costco’s valuation relies on consistent performance. Over the last three years, annual top-line growth averaged 7.3%. In the past twelve months, revenues increased by 8.1% to $275 billion. Operating income was around $10 billion, with an operating margin of 3.8% and a cash flow margin of 4.6%, generating nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow. Net income reached $8 billion, yielding a net margin of 2.9%, demonstrating Costco’s proficiency in converting growth into profitability. Recurring membership revenue, characterized by high margins, has proven particularly resilient. Last autumn, Costco raised membership fees for the first time since 2017, adding $5 or $10 for higher-tier members without negatively impacting retention. Costco operates 914 warehouses globally, including 629 in the U.S., maintaining its pricing advantage through razor-thin margins and the effectiveness of Kirkland Signature (Costco’s exclusive private label brand). In Q4, shopping frequency increased by 3.7%, while the average ticket rose by 2.6%, indicating that growth is driven by traffic rather than price. Its flexible supply chain reduces risks from tariffs and global sourcing. Two-thirds of merchandise is procured domestically. Localizing Kirkland production and the steady demand for essentials such as groceries and gas further diminish risk. Scale enhances pricing power, a crucial factor in maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a top-tier operator, but its high valuation may not align with fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid but not extraordinary. The pace of store expansion is slowing, and some new locations might cannibalize existing sales. The premium assumes sustained elevated growth. If comparable sales keep decelerating, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could be under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. You could look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive approach to maximize the benefits of favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Devotion To DIYers And Financial Wizardry Made AutoZone One Of America’s Best Performing Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2025/09/26/how-devotion-to-diyers-and-financial-wizardry-made-autozone-one-of-americas-best-performing-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-09-26T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByJohn Hyatt, Forbes Staff. Phil Daniele was working for a competing auto-parts chain when Auto­Zone entered the Jacksonville, Florida, market in 1986. Daniele had worked in car stores since high school, paying his way through college by stocking shelves. He joined AutoZone in 1993 as a store manager in training before being given his own store after a few months, the first of ten titles in three decades. “I’m not a phenomenon. If you look at our leadership team, many of our VPs started out in an hourly role at a store,” says Daniele, 56, who is now CEO of AutoZone. Today, AutoZone—known for its universal get in the zone, AutoZone radio jingle—employs 126,000 people, with over 6,500 stores in the U.S. and another 1,000 in Mexico and Brazil. The retailer sells everything from motor oil and upholstery cleaner to specialized car parts for nearly every make and model. With $18.5 billion in sales last year, it is worth about $70 billion. In the last 20 years, its shares have returned an average of 21% annually, trouncing the S&P 500’s 11% average return (including dividends reinvested) over the same period. AutoZone has generated nine figure–plus windfalls for its original private equity sponsor KKR, hedge fund billionaire Eddie Lampert and its founder, Pitt Hyde, who stepped down as CEO in 1996. “I wish I had never diversified—that was a huge mistake,” jokes Hyde, 82, who is worth around $2 billion today. He sold most of his Auto­Zone stock back in the 1990s. Had he kept it, he’d be worth over $10 billion. But it’s not just AutoZone’s investors and top brass who have gotten rich, and that is the company’s real secret sauce. With a compensation system built around stock options, the retailer has made many of its rank-and-file wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. More than 4,000 Auto­Zone employees—including many like Daniele who began as hourly employees or store managers in the 1980s and ’90s—have become millionaires from their AutoZone stock, Hyde says. “Our compensation structure is one of the key elements of our success,” says Bill Rhodes, chair of the board since 2007 and AutoZone’s CEO and president from 2005 to 2023. “There are very, very few companies that are still 100% stock options in their long-term incentives. That’s what we are with our senior leadership team.” Following a 2006 accounting rule change requiring companies to record options as expenses on their income statement, many S&P 500 companies have favored compensation packages with restricted and performance-based stock units (grants of stock with no exercise price) over stock options (the right to buy a stock at the price on the date it was awarded). But AutoZone stayed the course and has granted options awards to eligible employees every year for the past 25 years equal to 0.9% of its total shares outstan­ding. Executives can also elect to take 25% of their annual compensation in AutoZone stock. “Our people want the risk. They want the leverage that comes with stock options,” says Rhodes, who has netted over a half-billion dollars exercising options and selling the stock (before taxes). As it’s grown, AutoZone has restricted eligibility of stock options awards to about 400 higher-level employees, down from over 38,000 in the late ’90s. Today, store managers who drive Auto­Zone’s retail sales are incentivized with cash bonuses based on sales quotas. Store hands are supposed to ask people if they need help within 30 seconds of a customer walking into the store. They perform routine maintenance, like chan­ging batteries or installing wipers, at no cost and on site. Hit your targets and drive sales and you’ll be compensated for it. Or better yet, one day you may end up in corporate—which means stock options whose value only seems to go up. Employees can also buy up to $15,000 in AutoZone stock annually at a 15% discount to market price, through an employee stock purchase plan. The idea is to keep the sales force aligned, invested in AutoZone’s future and motivated to sell, sell, sell. At corporate, the mantra has been buy, buy, buy back its own stock. AutoZone has purchased $38 billion of its shares since 1998 through May 2025, reducing its outstanding share count by over 90% from 152 million to 16.7 million as of June. (Nineteen ninety-eight is also when it started limiting stock options.) The company has bought back more shares over time (155.5 million) than it originally had outstanding (152 million). How is that mathematically possible? It’s because of the dilution from all those stock options the company awards. The model has proven durable, thanks to Auto­Zone’s earnings moving in only one direction. Since 1987, revenue has increased every year (growing 11.5% annually), while operating income ($3.3 billion last year) and net income ($2.6 billion last year) have increased in all but three years. The company has been disciplined in its capital expenditure, opting for slow and steady earnings growth over breakneck expansion. It helps that the auto-parts industry cruises through recessions, as cash-strapped drivers opt to fix rather than replace their cars. “If you put financial engineering on top of a bad business you’re just going to go out of business faster,” Rhodes says. “If you have a really good business, putting financial engineering on top of that can optimize performance, or as I sometimes like to say, put it on steroids.” But to keep its well-oiled machine chugging, Auto­Zone needs to keep growing. It holds $9 billion in long-term debt on which it must pay interest ($450 million last year), and it has accelerated share repurchases, averaging $3.6 billion in annual share buybacks from 2021 through ’24, compared to an average of $1.2 billion the previous decade. Its biggest headaches are macro headwinds. For one, its beloved DIY customer—the fix-’er-up guy who comes into the local AutoZone store to be charmed by a motivated salesman—is “a bit of a dying breed,” says Phillip Blee, a consumer equity analyst at William Blair. In 1990, over half of Americans identified as car DIYers, but today, DIYers account for only a fifth of the total $400 billion automotive aftermarket. Not only have parts have gotten more expensive, cutting into the value proposition, but cars have become harder to repair as they have become more complex and computerized. AutoZone also faces growing competition for the diehard DIYers from the likes of Walmart, Costco and Amazon. “The big box retailers are some of the more near-term threats,” Blee says. AutoZone increasingly sells directly to repair shops, both independents and national chains, a market that now accounts for an estimated 75% of the entire industry and 90% of its growth, according to William Blair. In this space, where customer service is less about face-to-face salesmanship and more about delivering parts faster than anyone else, its biggest rival, O’Reilly Auto Parts, has raced ahead, generating $7.8 billion last year from commercial sales, compared to AutoZone’s $5.9 billion. Daniele sees that not as a failure but an opportunity. He says AutoZone is beefing up its distribution network with new megahubs that hold over 100,000 unique car parts for nearly any vehicle, from your sister’s new Toyota Camry to your neighbor’s beat-up Chevy Corvette. “We’ve worked on our strategy of expanding our supply chain. We’ve run it too tight before,” says the CEO, who ran the commercial business from 2015 to 2021. And AutoZone isn’t loosening its grip on DIYers; it’s just looking for them in different places. The chain plans to open 500 new stores in 2028, up from the 190 it has averaged the last five years, 200 of them in Mexico and Brazil. AutoZone is nothing if not adaptable. Joseph “Pitt” Hyde III founded the company, then called Auto Shack, in 1979 after seeing the writing on the wall for his family business, Memphis, Tennessee–based Malone & Hyde, which sold groceries to independent mom-and-pop grocery stores and small chains in the South. He watched as Walmart—on whose board he sat from 1978 to 1983—gobbled up his market share. His idea was to take Walmart’s retailer-distributor model, combine it with a shiny supermarket aesthetic and bring it to a smaller industry with fatter margins. Auto parts, which combined fixed prices, inelastic demand and no clear national brand, struck him as a clear winner. He researched the industry for a year before opening his first store in Forrest City, Arkansas. Within five years he had 170 stores. “I learned so much from Sam [Walton] about his whole productivity cycle,” Hyde recalls. “He was growing rapidly, and as he leveraged his central overhead he gained buying power. Rather than putting it on the bottom line, he reflected it in lower prices. And that’s what we instituted at AutoZone.” Clear-eyed about the trajectory of his two businesses’ futures, Hyde took Malone & Hyde private with KKR in 1984 and spun out AutoZone (renamed after a lawsuit by RadioShack) two years later. “It was really modeled after Walmart: low prices, great customer service . . . a good old-fashioned way of doing things,” says George Roberts, KKR’s billionaire cofounder, which made $2.3 billion on its AutoZone stake. Hyde stepped down as CEO and board chair in 1996 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Hedge fund billionaire Eddie Lampert, best known for merging Sears with Kmart, built a 30% stake in AutoZone between 1998 and 2001 and came to its board with ideas, including the share buyback program. “He pitched for us to change our capital allocation,” recalls Rhodes, who was then SVP of finance. “We’ve continued to use that over the years and it’s gotten bigger and bigger.” AutoZone’s smartest bet was its $57 million ($118 million in today’s dollars) acquisition in 1996 of vehicle diagnostics database Alldata, which employees use constantly to identify the exact car part any given customer needs (and how much it will cost). As AutoZone enters its next chapter, Daniele is determined to uphold what made it so successful and so rewarding. “Our culture has modified and morphed a little bit, but the primary tenets are the same,” he says. “If you’re committed to the industry and committed to the culture, you can do anything at this company.” If AutoZone can keep its stock market magic alive and its flock faithful, he just might be right.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. As generative AI transforms various industries, one of the most essential – yet frequently overlooked – elements driving this change is memory. Memory manufacturer Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is central to this evolution, supplying the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM necessary to keep extensive AI models operating at both speed and scale. As AI workloads become increasingly complex, memory is becoming vital for hyperscalers and cloud service providers. While GPUs and accelerators capture attention, memory is the discreet backbone that dictates the speed and efficiency of these systems. The stock price of Micron reflects this rising demand, having surged roughly 85% year-to-date in 2025. Nonetheless, is the stock still worthy of consideration at present valuations? Regardless of its appeal, investing in a single stock carries significant risk. The Trefis High-Quality Portfolio has been designed to lessen stock-specific risk while providing upside potential. The figures from Micron’s results speak for themselves. For the quarter ending in August, Micron’s revenue reached $11.32 billion, an increase of 46% year-over-year, while adjusted net income skyrocketed by 157% to $3.47 billion ($3.03 per diluted share). Remarkably, sales in the cloud memory segment more than tripled to $4.5 billion. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra informed analysts that the demand for Micron’s DRAM and NAND offerings was stronger than previously anticipated, enhancing the company’s outlook. Robust DRAM shipments across all end markets, strong pricing due to constrained supply and low inventory levels, along with slower transitions to newer process nodes limiting total output, are all factors contributing to growth. Micron anticipates a favorable demand-supply balance for DRAM in 2026, which will support ongoing profitability. For Q1 2026, Micron projects revenue of $12.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, marking an increase of approximately 61% year-over-year at the midpoint. HBM is an ultra-fast, low-latency memory primarily crafted for AI accelerators and GPUs to swiftly process vast model data, while DRAM provides larger-capacity, general-purpose memory supporting AI workloads by storing large volumes of data, albeit at slower transfer speeds than HBM. Micron serves as a primary memory and storage partner for Nvidia’s Blackwell GB200 and GB300 platforms, supplying both HBM3E and LPDDR5X solutions, and is also a key supplier for AMD’s Instinct MI350 GPUs. Nvidia’s latest systems incorporate 33% more memory per node compared to previous generations, as AI models increasingly adopt a multimodal approach – integrating text, video, and speech – heightening the demand for memory. Refer to our note on how Micron Stock Surges 2x To $300 To underscore the magnitude of investment in AI, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have suggested that they could collectively commit $364 billion to capital expenditures in their respective current fiscal years. Earlier in September, Oracle revealed it has entered into contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars to offer cloud computing services to OpenAI and other large clients. While these infrastructure agreements will necessitate computing power – either GPUs or custom ASICs, as well as server and networking equipment, memory will also be vital, and Micron stands to gain significantly from this expansion. With the ascent of AI adoption throughout the economy, Micron is poised for sustained growth. Indications suggest that the most compute-intensive phase of AI training may start to plateau, with the industry pivoting toward inference – the application of trained models to fresh data in real-time and at massive scale. Inference is less demanding per task but takes place continuously across millions of users and applications. HBM is critical for enabling AI inference at scale, thanks to its bandwidth and power efficiency benefits, complementing high-performance GPUs primarily utilized for training. This trend undeniably favors specialized, power-efficient suppliers like Micron. However, supply may struggle to keep up. Manufacturing HBM is more complex than producing standard DRAM, and supply levels remain tight. Creating HBM is wafer-intensive—it necessitates around three times more wafers than standard DRAM to yield the same volume of bits due to its lower bit density and complex 3D stacking, resulting in a natural bottleneck. While Micron has been increasing its HBM production capabilities, its output for 2025 has already been sold out, with strong demand expected for 2026. The company allocated $13.8 billion for capital expenditures in FY’25 and plans to further boost spending in 2026, chiefly to enhance DRAM capacity for AI workloads. For Q1 2026 alone, Micron aims to invest $4.5 billion, with the majority of capex focused on DRAM. This figure serves as a baseline for what investors can anticipate each quarter, indicating that total capital expenditures for the year will likely exceed $18 billion. Despite this notable rally, Micron stock is valued at approximately 10 times estimated earnings for 2026. Projected growth appears robust: anticipated revenues are expected to increase by 42% in 2026, based on consensus forecasts. Nevertheless, the memory market has historically been cyclical. DRAM and NAND are susceptible to variations in supply and demand, along with price volatility. At this point, it seems that HBM acts as a partially secular growth factor, given the relentless investment by major tech firms over the last three years. However, HBM currently represents only a small fraction of total sales, meaning the company is not completely shielded from traditional market cycles. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, boasts a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap — and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

Title: I'm an Amazon software engineer who wasn't selected for the H-1B visa. I was obsessed with staying in the US‚ but not anymore.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Wen-Hsing Huang, a 25-year-old software development engineer at Amazon who's from Taiwan and is now in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Huang's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I always knew I wanted to study and work in the United States. When I was 18, I dreamed of making $200,000 a year working in Big Tech when I graduated. Over time, I began to question whether I wanted my career dictated by a visa. I realized how little control I had over external factors: the economy, layoffs, and visa policies. The only thing I could control was my response. That's why I'm not overly stressed about the latest H-1B visa updates. My experiences have made me resilient and given me a more mature mentality to overcome challenges. The new American dream isn't about staying in America; it's about using the skills, network, and savings you build here to create a life where you're not at the mercy of visas, layoffs, or politics. For me, that means returning home, building something of my own, and enjoying the freedom that comes with it. Do you have experience with the H-1B visa program? Business Insider wants to hear from you. Please fill out this quick form. My original plan was to come to the US on an F-1 visa, study, and work on the Optional Practical Training program, which allows international students to work for a year after graduating — or up to three years if you're in STEM. It's a common path for international students to get their start in the US. I wanted to work for a company that could apply for a green card for me, work full time for five years, become a senior software engineer, and then pursue my dream of entrepreneurship, since I would have a better safety net and wouldn't need to worry about my visa. I'd work for another 10 to 20 years, achieve FIRE (financial independence, retire early), and retire at 40 years old. I studied very hard at National Central University in Taiwan, graduating at the top of my class. My English wasn't very good, but I worked hard enough to earn a spot in the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign master's program in computer science. I arrived on an F-1 student visa in 2022, when there were mass tech layoffs at Meta, Twitter, and many other companies. Finding a summer internship was really difficult. Usually, that's the path to a full-time job, but I had no offers. I had borrowed $100,000 from my parents to study in the US, and they weren't that wealthy. If I didn't land a job after graduation, I would have to leave within 60 days, $100,000 in debt to my parents. I committed myself full time to finding a full-time job. I practiced my elevator pitch repeatedly, attended every career fair I could find, refined my coding skills and résumé, and applied to any opportunities I saw. My mental health was pretty terrible during that time, but it gave me good life experience and made me learn what I can and can't control in life. After graduating from my program, I landed a job at ASM, a semiconductor company in Arizona. Six months later, in September 2024, I joined Amazon, where I've been working ever since. At first, I was obsessed with staying in the US. I wanted a green card and was very afraid I wouldn't be able to stay. The turning point came in April 2025, when there was a lot of news about F-1 students being deported. I didn't get selected in the H-1B lottery for the second time and felt very uncertain and insecure. I'd planned a trip to Japan that month, and despite the news, I traveled because I realized I didn't care whether I stayed in the US or not. I'll have one more chance to apply for the H-1B visa next year before my OPT runs out, but I've already made peace with the possibility of leaving. Many people have an illusion of stability, but the world isn't stable, and neither is the economy. Layoffs can happen anytime. I believe AI will replace many jobs, including in software. These are some factors that pushed me to act with urgency and control my own life. I don't want to sacrifice my 20s trying to get this uncertain and illusory American dream. For three years, every major decision had to be filtered through "Will this affect my visa status?" rather than "Is this what I actually want to do?" I couldn't test business ideas, take entrepreneurial risks, or even travel freely without worrying about reentry. Now, my plan is different. I'll keep working at Amazon a while longer, save money, and return to Taiwan to start my own business. With the internet, borders matter less. I can register a company in the US, serve a global customer base, and earn US-level income while enjoying Taiwan's lower cost of living and better healthcare. Despite the challenging process, I'm still very grateful for my time in America. I earned my degree, gained Big Tech experience, broadened my perspective, and learned life's most important lessons: resilience — maintaining strength amid uncertainty — and finding my true values. I came here with deep admiration for a country that has always attracted adventurers in pursuit of freedom and opportunity, where, regardless of your background or where you come from, talent and perseverance matter more than origins. I believe that America still exists in spirit. But leaving means I can finally make decisions based on what I want to build rather than what my visa allows. I don't give advice to others; everyone has their own priorities. But for me, leaving the US isn't a failure. It's freedom. Have a story or tip?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Kamala Harris’s 107 Days offers a devastating indictment of Joe Biden. It also documents the limits of her own politics. Presidents cast long shadows. Vice presidents are usually doomed to live in those shadows. If presidents are stars on the stage of world history, vice presidents are nervous understudies hidden away behind the scenes. They live in interminable limbo, on call in case some catastrophe (a scandal, death, assassination) requires their elevation. As such transfers of power are not the norm, vice presidents can usually be found in unglamorous busy work, at best breaking tie votes in the Senate and at worst serving as White House gofers. The popular HBO show Veep, which starred Julia-Louis Dreyfus as a hapless vice president, wrung seven seasons of cringy comedy out of the inherent awkwardness and ignominy of the position. The pathos of being a veep pervades Kamala Harris’s campaign memoir 107 Days. Reflecting on her messy succession, she tells the story of how she ended up taking over the Democratic presidential nomination from Joe Biden last year and eventually losing to Donald Trump. Harris quotes the familiar gibe of John Nance Garner, Franklin Roosevelt’s first running mate, that the job of vice president is not “worth a bucket of warm piss.” Harris is not the first vice president to air her grievances. In 1962, the master of resentment, former vice president Richard Nixon, wrote Six Crises, a seething effort at reputational rehabilitation that sought to both explain his loss to Kennedy and carve out a political identity independent of Eisenhower. In passive-aggressive form, Nixon complains about Kennedy’s alleged skulduggery in the narrow victory in the 1960 presidential election and makes clear his frustration about Eisenhower’s constantly undermining him. Nixon’s anger was not entirely baseless, either. When asked about what Nixon had contributed to the White House, Eisenhower replied: “If you give me a week, I might think of something.” 107 Days is a very similar book to Six Crises: an exercise in taking stock and blame shifting, with an eye toward a future presidential bid. Harris knows the second presidential victory of Trump is a massive historical disaster and she needs to offer a plausible accounting if she ever wants another chance at the White House, and so 107 Days is her effort to point fingers—just primarily at others. The major target of these pointed fingers is Joe Biden. It is, 107 Days argues, all his fault: Biden’s selfish decision to run for a second term despite his advanced age created a situation where Harris faced the impossible task of running a truncated campaign of 107 days. Aside from creating a nearly hopeless situation, Biden and his cronies, per Harris, constantly undermined her before and after she was the nominee. Harris contrasts this destructive behavior against her own loyalty, which arguably also harmed her, since she was unable to separate herself from Biden. But here a lot of blame also falls on Harris’s shoulders. In painting such a devastating picture of Biden, Harris raises questions about her own political judgment. Why did she remain so loyal to Biden even when his own policies and decisions appeared to put the country and hundreds of thousands of people’s lives at risk? In this way, 107 Days is also, mostly unintentionally, an indictment of the kind of clubby elite liberalism that both Biden and Harris benefited from and to which they mostly adhered. Harris’s recognition of her own complicity creeps in every once in a while. Like Nixon, Harris uneasily mixes gratitude with grudges throughout 107 Days. She writes, “The rapport between Joe and me was genuine. For two people who seemingly couldn’t have been more different, our values were incredibly aligned.” She then adds in the next paragraph that “the president’s approval rating of 41 percent was a ball and chain dragging down my campaign.” Since Biden was inaugurated as president at the advanced age of 78, realism alone should have dictated that he groom Harris to take charge when and if necessary. Yet, Harris notes, he and the White House did the opposite: They gave her politically risky tasks (such as being the face of the administration’s border policy) and refused to defend her from unfair media attacks. This was true even after the disastrous debate between Biden and Trump, when a tense Jill Biden did not turn to Harris for solace or advice but instead to demand loyalty. “Are you supporting us?” she asked Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff. “That’s really important, we need to know.” Harris could answer honestly yes. She had, at least in her retelling, always been a good soldier and loyal to a fault. Everyone was going to wait for “Joe and Jill’s decision.” As Harris recalls: We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision. When the dam broke and Biden did withdraw, Harris also still remained loyal. Loyalty meant no public criticism of Biden even where he was clearly wrong, most glaringly in his nearly unwavering support of Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. Harris claims in private that she tried to change Biden’s mind, noting that I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on the issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians. But he couldn’t do it; while he could passionately state, “I am a Zionist,” his remarks about the innocent Palestinians came off as inadequate and forced. That Harris tried to change Biden’s mind was a good thing, but it’s not hard to miss that when talking about Gaza, she reverts to the gauzy language of empathy without making clear what concrete measures she thought were necessary to end the slaughter. It’s even harder to miss how silent she was in public on the matter. Private pleas for Biden to show some heart were simply an inadequate response to the killing fields of Gaza, which anyone with eyes could recognize as a genocide. Evasive about her responsibility for Gaza, Harris is critical of herself in retrospect on other matters, though these criticisms are mostly not over policy but messaging. Harris tells readers that she regrets she wasn’t able to sell her brand of centrist liberalism to young people, and she does some self-flagellation over some botched media appearances. One such gaffe occurred when she appeared on The View and was asked, “If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?” Harris responded, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.” Harris knows this is the wrong answer, but the response she thought she should have given (that she would have appointed a Republican in the cabinet, something she said after the break) is hardly reassuring. After this appearance, her adviser David Plouffe, a veteran Barack Obama campaign adviser, told her, “People hate Joe Biden.” In her view, this was her gravest error: not acknowledging Biden’s. “Why. Didn’t. I. Separate. Myself. From. Joe. Biden?” Katherine Krueger StudentNation / Gabe Levin Jeet Heer Elizabeth Spiers Part of the problem, at least according to Harris, is that Biden’s team seemed to imply that if she were to distance herself from him, his supporters might sabotage her campaign in swing states. But another reason is that her centrist politics were almost identical to his (with Biden indeed being perhaps more willing to criticize the rich than she is). Like Biden, she was a pro-system politician, one who believes the status quo needs reform but not a radical overhaul. The problem for the Democrats is that this pro-system politics allows Donald Trump to absorb all the intense popular anger at the existing order. This is one root of the party’s failure and Trump’s two victories. In 107 Days, Harris continually touts herself as a prosecutor. Defending her childcare proposal, she says the Republicans “mischaracterized” it as “socialism” but “I call it capitalism and a great ROI [return on investment].” But did Harris truly make a good case for herself and for the Democrats more generally? Like many liberals, Harris is quick to decry Trumpian “fascism” but refuses to see that this wave of right-wing authoritarianism is driven by the dynamics of capitalist exploitation, social alienation, and economic inequality. She repeatedly praises her “politically astute” brother-in-law Tony West, a trusted adviser and senior vice president at Uber. But she doesn’t acknowledge the reporting that West, to please Wall Street, helped water down her economic message by muting populist critiques of price gouging. This was surely a factor in her defeat, one separate from the selfish arrogance of Joe Biden. Toward the end of the book, Harris seems to have a glimmer that her politics is not up to the tasks of the moment. Surveying her career, she writes, “I wanted to make changes from inside the system.” Then she reflects that, “in this critical moment, working within the system, by itself, is not proving to be enough.” This is true and points to a much more radical conclusion than Harris is willing to make. The key is that the Democrats need to break not just with Joe Biden but with neoliberalism as a whole. Status-quo liberal politics has failed, and with 107 Days Kamala Harris has, surely not by design, written one of its obituaries. On September 15, Vice President JD Vance attacked The Nation while hosting The Charlie Kirk Show. In a clip seen millions of times, Vance singled out The Nation in a dog whistle to his far-right followers. Predictably, a torrent of abuse followed. Throughout our 160 years of publishing fierce, independent journalism, we’ve operated with the belief that dissent is the highest form of patriotism. We’ve been criticized by both Democratic and Republican officeholders—and we’re pleased that the White House is reading The Nation. As long as Vance is free to criticize us and we are free to criticize him, the American experiment will continue as it should. To correct the record on Vance’s false claims about the source of our funding: The Nation is proudly reader-supported by progressives like you who support independent journalism and won’t be intimidated by those in power. Vance and Trump administration officials also laid out their plans for widespread repression against progressive groups. Instead of calling for national healing, the administration is using Kirk’s death as pretext for a concerted attack on Trump’s enemies on the left. Now we know The Nation is front and center on their minds. Your support today will make our critical work possible in the months and years ahead.

Title: Key Indicators to Watch in Q4: Bitcoin Seasonal Trends, XRP/BTC, Dollar Index, Nvidia, and More

This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. As we approach the final quarter of 2025, the following key charts provide valuable insights to help crypto traders navigate the evolving market landscape. Seasonal trends suggest a bullish Q4 outlook for both BTC$113,639.86 and ETH$4,113.77, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Since 2013, BTC$113,639.86 has delivered an average return of 85% in the final quarter, according to data from Coinglass, making Q4 historically the strongest period for bulls. November stands out as the most bullish month, with an average gain of 46%, followed by October, which typically sees a 21% increase. ETH$4,113.77 also tends to perform well in the last three months of the year, although its strongest historical returns have been in the first quarter since inception. Bitcoin's price has dropped by 5% this week, consistent with the bearish technical signals and looks set to extend losses to late August lows near $107,300. If bulls fail to defend that, the focus will shift to the 200-day simple moving average at $104,200. The ongoing price decline, combined with bitcoin's historical pattern of peaking approximately 16 to 18 months after a halving event, may scare bulls. However, such concerns may be premature as long as prices remain above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This moving average has consistently acted as a support level, marking the end of corrective price pullbacks during the current bull run that began in early 2023. Traders, therefore, should closely watch the 50-week SMA, which is currently positioned around $98,900, as a key level for broader market direction. XRP, often called the "U.S. government coin" by firms like Arca, has surged 32% this year. However, despite this strong rally, the payments-focused cryptocurrency remains confined within a prolonged sideways trading range against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC), showing limited relative strength. The XRP/BTC pair has been confined within a narrow trading range since early 2021, resulting in over four years of low-volatility compression. Recent price action near the upper boundary of this channel suggests that bulls are gradually gaining control. A breakout from such a prolonged consolidation could trigger a powerful rally in XRP relative to BTC, as the accumulated energy from this squeeze is released. Now, let’s turn to charts that call for caution. The leveraged anti-Strategy ETF (SMST), which seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in bitcoin-holder Strategy's (MSTR) share price, is flashing bullish signals. The ETF’s price climbed to a five-month high of $35.65, forming what appears to be an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, characterized by a prominent trough (the head) flanked by two smaller, roughly equal troughs (the shoulders). This pattern often signals a potential bullish reversal, suggesting the ETF may be gearing up for a significant upward move. In other words, it's flashing a bearish signal for both BTC and Strategy, which is the largest publicly listed BTC holder with a coin stash of 639,835 BTC. Last week, I discussed the dollar's post-Fed rate cut resilience as a potential headwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The dollar index has since gained ground, establishing a double bottom at around 96.30. It's a sign that bulls have successfully established the path of least resistance on the higher side. A continued move beyond 100.26, the high of the interim recovery between the twin bottoms around 96.30, would confirm the so-called double bottom breakout, opening the door for a move to 104.00. Watch out for the pattern failure below 96.00, as that could lead to increased risk-taking in financial markets. Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest listed company by market value, and a bellwether for risk assets, continues to flirt with the upper end of the broadening channel identified by June 2024 and November 2024 highs and lows hit in August 2024 and April 2025. The rally has stalled at the upper trendline since late July in a sign of bullish exhaustion. Should it decline from here, it could signal the onset of a risk-off period in global markets, including cryptocurrencies.

Title: Alibaba stock’s AI-powered run isn’t done

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Last autumn, Alibaba was rallying on China’s stimulus plans. Now, its artificial intelligence moves are powering the stock, and it looks like there will be more gains to come. Shares of Alibaba Group Holding have jumped some 77% since Barron’s recommended them last fall. While the stock might not rally at such breakneck speed going forward, it appears poised to keep climbing—especially since it doesn’t look too pricey. China’s determination to stand on equal AI footing with the U.S. is a major factor in the stock’s favor, as Alibaba is pushing to be a central player in the country’s ongoing AI and cloud adoption. On Wednesday, Alibaba released a flurry of updates that sent its American depositary shares higher. The company plans to boost its AI spending, open new data centers across Asia, Europe, and North and South America—while also unveiling its largest AI language model on record, Qwen3-Max, with more than a trillion parameters. The company is also partnering with Nvidia to integrate the superstar chip maker’s products into tools like robots and self-driving cars. Many on Wall Street like what they’re seeing, with nearly 90% of analysts tracked by FactSet bullish on Alibaba. Citigroup’s Alicia Yap reiterated a Buy rating on the stock following the latest AI announcement. She also boosted her price target for Alibaba’s ADRs to $217 from $187 to account for her more optimistic revenue estimates for its cloud division. “Being one of the five to six global super cloud platforms with full-stack AI services, we believe Alibaba is well-positioned to capture the artificial superintelligence evolution," she wrote. It’s not just that Alibaba is seeing so many technological advances. Rather, it’s becoming an integrated one-stop shop for AI and cloud services, emulating major Western players’ full-stack model, which means they’re in control of the process and development from start to finish. “Alibaba will build Alibaba Cloud into a full-stack AI service provider, similar to what we see with Amazon Web Services/Google Cloud Platform, including the compute layer to power AI training/inference and offering proprietary open-source models within its own cloud environment," writes Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, He has an Outperform rating on Alibaba, and raised his price target to $174 from $153 on Wednesday. Perhaps even more importantly, however, Alibaba’s recent winning streak and announcements show that it’s no longer on the outs with Beijing. China has shown that it is committed to rivaling the U.S. when it comes to AI capabilities. As Barron’s notes, the fact that Alibaba has been able to notch so many AI victories suggests that it has done so with the Chinese government’s blessing. Although China’s chip capabilities are rapidly advancing, Nvidia chips are still the gold standard in many cases. Therefore, Alibaba’s Nvidia partnership likely required government approval, considering the company passed over domestic semiconductor companies, Gavekal analyst Tilly Zhang noted. That suggests China potentially “has more regulatory flexibility" when it comes to promoting AI evolution, she adds, with Alibaba at the forefront. Of course, investing in Chinese companies will always take some leap of faith: Government favor can change and other corporate information may not be readily forthcoming, leading to valuation gaps. Nonetheless, with Alibaba’s ADRs changing hands for just over 17 times the next fiscal year’s expected earnings, it looks worth the risk. It goes without saying they are far less expensive than even the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven—Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms trade in the mid-20 times range. There are other legitimate worries, however. The Zephirin Group analyst Lenny Zephirin, an Alibaba bear, argues that U.S. tech companies’ spending and advancement still far outstrip those of China, meaning the upside for Alibaba has been exaggerated. Still, as long as the company is increasingly backed by Beijing—and the tech halo extends beyond the U.S.—the shares are likely to keep outperforming while the AI trade dominates. Alibaba may never be on par with U.S. tech companies in a number of metrics. Yet it doesn’t need to be for its stock to keep winning.

Title: Top companies keep talking about AI – but can’t explain the upsides

The biggest US-listed companies keep talking about artificial intelligence. But other than the “fear of missing out,” few appear to be able to describe how the technology is changing their businesses for the better. That is the conclusion of a Financial Times analysis of hundreds of corporate filings and executive transcripts at S&P 500 companies last year, providing one of the most comprehensive insights yet into how the AI wave is rippling through American industry. Big Tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have regularly extolled AI’s benefits, pledging to invest $300 billion (€254 billion) this year alone to develop the infrastructure around large language models. Large companies far from Silicon Valley, from beverages giant Coca-Cola to sportswear maker Lululemon, are also discussing AI at ever-greater length in their regulatory filings. But they also largely paint a more sober picture of the technology’s usefulness, expressing concern over cybersecurity, legal risks and the potential for it to fail. Customer service support and data-heavy businesses have found it easiest to explain their use of the technology. Paycom, a payroll services provider, reported in filings that AI is an “important differentiator” for attracting and retaining clients. The filings do reveal a number of innovative uses of the technology. Huntington Ingalls, a military supplier, is applying AI “for battlefield decisions”. Animal health group Zoetis is using the technology to speed up medical tests for horses. Dover Corporation, a manufacturer, has a new process for tracking “hail-damaged vehicles” through to their repair. But AI adoption has not necessarily led to more growth. Dover Corporation’s stock has done the best of those three companies since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, almost matching the S&P 500 Equal Weighted index. [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] This index does not allow the size of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – to dominate results, and is better for comparing whether a stock has performed better than others in the index. “When it comes to AI adoption, many companies aren’t guided by strategy but by ‘Fomo’,” said Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at consultancy Gartner. “For some leaders, the question isn’t ‘What problem am I solving?’ but ‘What if my competitor solves it first?’” The FT has used AI tools to identify these mentions of the technology in SEC 10-k filings and earnings transcripts, then to categorise each mention. The results were then checked and analysed to help draw a nuanced picture about what companies were saying to different audiences about the technology. SEC filings require companies to disclose risks to the businesses, and are necessarily more cautious than the sales pitches made by executives on earnings calls. But the increasing array of risks described in filings appears not to be weighing on executives in the public pronouncements. Of the S&P 500, 374 companies mentioned AI on earnings calls in the past 12 months – with 87 per cent of the calls logged as wholly positive about the technology with no concerns expressed. Over the past five years, the boom of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks has driven a large portion of the S&P 500’s growth. While non-tech companies are upbeat about AI, their filings suggest less clear upsides. During an earnings call in February, Coca-Cola was excited about the technology – even though the key use was in the production of a TV commercial. The FT sought to categorise the expected positive benefits of the technology. Most of the anticipated benefits, such as increased productivity, were vaguely stated and harder to categorise than the risks. Companies anticipated being able to optimise workflows through automation, and hope to achieve market differentiation through their use of AI. Some hoped to be able to use the technology to improve the personalisation of their products. Meta, which has spent billions of dollars to hire a team of researchers dedicated to building ‘superintelligence’, was among the Big Tech groups to warn it could incur large legal settlements over allegations ‘that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models' Filings do reveal that the companies able to give clear AI upsides include those that serve the rising AI-driven data-centre boom. Energy companies First Solar and Entergy cited AI as a demand driver. Freeport-McMoran, which has a stockpile of copper, stated that “data centres and artificial intelligence developments” would support the metal’s price. The company also said the technology can help with material characterisation and mineral extraction. Equipment manufacturer Caterpillar reported that its energy business was benefiting from supporting “data centre growth related to cloud computing and generative artificial intelligence”. As the number of companies discussing AI has grown, fewer businesses are expressing positive views about the technology than they did in 2022. The most commonly cited concern was cybersecurity, which was mentioned as a risk by more than half of the S&P 500 in 2024. Online dating group Match warned that “the use of AI has been known to result in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents that implicate the personal data of end users of AI-enhanced services”. [ AI begins to bite: Recruiters attribute a slump in professional services hiring to job automationOpens in new window ] Companies expressed particular concern that other businesses and customers could prove to be weak links. Lululemon said it was concerned about security risks posed by advanced AI technologies, which could lead to sensitive information, such as transaction data, being compromised. Microsoft struck a dramatic tone, saying “[i]neffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended”. “Companies tend to see AI as a risk because they’re not used to having systems or processes which they can’t rely upon 100 per cent,” said Ray Eitel-Porter, an AI governance expert and author. The second-largest concern among US companies is the fear that their efforts to introduce the technology will not be successful. Recent research led by Aditya Challapally at the MIT Media Lab found 95 per cent of generative AI pilots in the workplace failed. This was because the current generation of AI tools lack features such as long-term memory and customisation, which would make them easier to plug into existing company systems. “When we spoke to executives, they would often say the internal tool was very successful,” said Challapally. “But when we spoke to employees we found zero usage.” In 174 annual reports, another common concern is the rise of regulatory and legal concerns over implementing AI. Meta, which has spent billions of dollars to hire a team of researchers dedicated to building “superintelligence”, was among the Big Tech groups to warn it could incur large legal settlements over allegations “that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models”. Other companies with less AI exposure have raised similar worries. PepsiCo said “our use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorised use of third-party technology or content”. The FT’s analysis shows that companies are a lot clearer about the potential problems with AI than the upsides. “[T]here can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability,” Meta wrote in its 10k form last year. “We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: US lawmakers have questions for Big Tech and others on H-1B hiring practices
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-senators-grassley-durbin-letter-big-tech-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-26T02:11:03Z

Two US senators have questions for Big Tech and other top companies over their use of H-1B visas amid the Trump administration's push to slow down foreign worker hiring practices. In letters sent to 10 companies on Wednesday, including Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, and JPMorgan Chase, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin said they were concerned about the use of H-1B visa workers while the tech sector experiences a "high unemployment rate." The senators cited the layoffs the companies conducted in recent years and the number of H-1B visas they applied for in 2025. In the letter addressed to Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, the senators wrote that Amazon had laid off "tens of thousands of employees in recent years" while it was approved to hire "at least 10,033 H-1B employees" in the latest fiscal year. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the letter said. Each letter contains eight questions regarding the company's foreign hiring practices, including whether a company has "displaced any American employees with H-1B employees." The letters were sent to Amazon, Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Walmart. Spokespeople for these companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The probe comes just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that implements a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B application. The initial unveiling of the H-1B overhaul sent companies scrambling to notify their foreign employees to get back to the US in under 24 hours. The White House later clarified that it was for new visas. Some business leaders, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, hailed the move as a necessary corrective to the existing process, while others said it could hurt smaller companies that can't afford $100,000 application fees. A JPMorgan Chase report published Tuesday said that the new fee could reduce the US work authorizations by 5,500 per month. Jump to

American history’s second-longest-tenured Fed chairman also knows a thing or many about recessions, obviously, and the two are related: Sales of men’s underwear, Greenspan once reportedly suggested, are inversely proportional to economic anxiety. As the theory goes, men see underwear as a luxury, not a necessity. When money gets tight, boxers get holey. According to folk wisdom, when a recession is imminent, sales of snacks, cigarettes, champagne, and cardboard boxes also go down. Demand for lipstick, laxatives, instant noodles, used clothing, high heels, scary movies, and mini liquor bottles, meanwhile, goes up. Hemlines drop; law-school applications rise. Baby butts get rashy. Halloween gets less spooky. People gravitate toward public libraries and private labels. They spend less at restaurants. They stop dyeing their hair and dry-cleaning their clothes and going to the strip club, and they definitely do not buy an RV. Well, supposedly. If you ask an economist, they will almost certainly tell you that a recession is indicated by things such as mounting unemployment, falling industrial production, and short-term interest rates rising relative to long-term ones. If you ask the people working at National Bureau of Economic Research, who actually make the call about a recession, they will say it is a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” They are highly unlikely to tell you that the best way to understand the state of global markets is to take a look at your ankles. That’s not to say that pop-culture recession indicators are meaningless. A recession is a phenomenon necessarily defined in hindsight, usually long after life has changed on the ground: The Great Recession officially began at the end of 2007, but NBER didn’t announce that it had until the following December, right around when more than half a million people lost their jobs in a single month. Consumer behavior is a reactive measure of how much money people have in their pocket, which is probably why Greenspan was apparently paying attention to underwear. Many other pop-culture recession indicators—including the rise in law-school applications, the decline in demand for cardboard boxes, and the growing use of libraries and generic products—have been validated as useful signals about the health of the economy. They currently show what the more traditional indicators also show: The American economy is full of uncertainty, even though it has not yet tipped officially into recession. But taking anecdotal intuition about individual consumer psychology and extrapolating widely can lead to some odd and unhelpful conclusions. The way people spend their money is personal, and the product of a complex set of factors. It’s also sometimes illogical. Case in point: In 2008, when the Nielsen Company did an analysis of consumer behavior during a recession, the firm’s findings indicated that whereas candy is recession-proof, soda—liquid candy—is among the most recession-prone consumer goods. And societies don’t respond to crises the same way every time. The hemline index, which holds that in bad times hemlines go down and in good times they rise, is one of the most cited pop-culture recession indicators. It originated in the 1920s, when most women didn’t work outside the home, style (and society) were far more rigid, the fashion industry operated completely differently, and the miniskirt did not exist. Even if it were possible to reliably measure hemlines on a large scale, they are also influenced, in the short and long term, by trends, weather, and norms. Economic anxiety is a powerful force, but it is not the only force dictating the way people act. Here is what we know, according to Joanne Hsu, who runs the University of Michigan’s consumer-sentiment survey program. Generally speaking, the less money people feel like they have, the more likely they are to skip big expenses and to substitute cheaper, lower-quality goods where they can. (Indeed, sales of Hamburger Helper are up 14.5 percent this year, as sales of most luxury goods are down.) They seek out stress relief, good deals, and cheap indulgence. They also apparently seek out economic folk wisdom. This may not be a recession, but it is definitely a boom time for talking about being in a recession. According to various reports, people are, at this moment, listening to “recession pop,” going “recession blonde,” and getting “recession nails.” Online, the recession indicator has quickly gone from pop-economic trivium to absurdist meme. Among the supposed signs of our impending economic catastrophe that whizzed past me this spring and summer like the world’s most depressing rewrite of “We Didn’t Start the Fire”: Labubus, urban lumberjacks, messy buns, capri pants, hot women in eviction court, Hot Pockets changing its packaging, the Coachella lineup dropping early, the resurgence of frozen yogurt, a new Air Bud sequel, an American pope. Some of these are legible enough; many are ridiculous. (Recession indicator is this season’s Sir, this is a Wendy’s, the blank form through which anyone can launder a basic observation into something that sort of resembles a joke, especially if you’re not paying very close attention.) None of these meme indicators have, to my knowledge, been formally validated by the academic establishment. But I find it very telling that young people on the internet are casually invoking an arcane economic concept in order to explain the way their world feels. Maybe the ultimate recession indicator is how much people are talking about recession indicators. Not that I blame them. “Recession indicators” are appealing like the 10-day weather forecast is appealing. We turn to them not because they are accurate, but because they offer the illusion of control. Everyone gets rained on in a monsoon, but it’s still nice to know to pack an umbrella. These little predictors make the abstract feel concrete and the future feel foreseeable, maybe even manageable. They reduce the economy—sprawling, complex, scary-big—down to something as small as a tube of lipstick. And maybe most important, they’re a quasi-academic way of corroborating your own reality—a vibe check, a pat on the shoulder, a Ph.D. for your dread. Starting in 2022, as inflation surged post-lockdowns, economists have been predicting a recession. Thus far, one hasn’t officially arrived. But try saying that to people paying $8 for eggs. “People don’t feel like they’re thriving as they should be, as they might expect to,” Hsu told me. “So I think it makes sense that people are looking for things that validate their experiences.” Of all the unorthodox recession indicators, cardboard-box production is one of the most reliable, because cardboard boxes are a very straightforward proxy for the quantity of goods being shipped around the world. The outlook isn’t good: On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that box shipments are at their lowest levels since 2016. All across the economy, people are buying less and doing less. They’re forgoing the things they really want because they cannot afford them, because they don’t have enough money. At a certain point, that’s indicator enough.

Title: Costco reportedly comments on removing Xbox stock — "We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console."

Costco vs. Xbox bust up reportedly confirmed, as the retailer says plans to ditch Xbox consoles was a "business decision," without providing specifics. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What does Xbox and Ferrari have in common? Well, primarily you can say they're pretty expensive. In the United States and beyond, Microsoft has been gradually raising the price of its Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S hardware. However, United States customers are feeling the pinch the hardest, owing to President Trump's tariff blitz on foreign imports. The vast majority of Xbox console hardware is manufactured in China, which is subject to a variety of duties that impacts cost. Some types of electronics are exempt, such as traditional computers and smartphones. Video game consoles, however, are not exempt. In response, Microsoft has raised the price of Xbox Series X|S consoles not once, but twice in the United States. When importing Xbox console stock from China, Microsoft has to pay a tax to the United States government, which disrupts the wafer-thin to non-existent profit margin on console hardware. Microsoft, like most other manufacturers (PlayStation included) have been passing on the cost to consumers, leading to higher prices. Some retailers don't seem happy with the new price points. Costco is one such retailer. This week, we wrote about reports that Costco has begun removing Xbox hardware and accessories from its store shelves — not just in the U.S., but globally. Microsoft and Costco haven't really issued a statement through typical channels, but former IGN journalist and video game commentator Destin Legarie says he's managed to get a statement out of the company. Just called Costco about Xbox stock. I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. “We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console.” Saying. It was a business decision.They did say they have some great deals on Switch & PlayStation, though.September 25, 2025 "Just called Costco about Xbox stock," Destin's post on X reads. "I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. 'We don't have plans going forward to carry an Xbox console,' saying it was a business decision. They did have some great deals on Switch and PlayStation, though." For our part, we can confirm that this isn't just a blip or typical stock shortage. Costco has indeed been removing Xbox console hardware and has them on clearance sales in certain regions. Something is definitely going on, but Microsoft has so far declined to comment. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Microsoft has had a tough generation for Xbox hardware. Still reeling from the negative reception of the Xbox One, Microsoft hasn't really ever recovered its competitive edge against PlayStation's competing solution. But, the industry has changed. Despite hardware sales being anaemic, Microsoft has found success moving its popular franchises to PlayStation and PC. Xbox Series X|S also punches well above its weight. Xbox Game Pass, which is only available within the Microsoft gaming ecosystem, is a huge driver of the business. Despite having a smaller install base on paper, Xbox users are often reported to be disproportionately engaged and spendy. Microsoft's "Everything is an Xbox" strategy has been a winner thus far, with the gaming division outpacing Windows itself as a cornerstone of Microsoft's overall business pie. Despite the hardware struggles on paper, the Xbox ecosystem arguably enjoys better support from developers than ever, with Square Enix returning to the platform with Final Fantasy, and PlayStation itself publishing Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S this summer, too. Still, losing a major retailer like Costco does raise questions. Microsoft's next-gen Xbox hardware is widely expected to be Windows-oriented and PC-like, enabling OEMs like ASUS to potentially construct their own Xbox compatible PCs for the living room too. The very interesting PC handheld Xbox Ally is the first glimpse at that strategy, set to launch on October 16, 2025. It doesn't look like Costco will be part of the fun, though. There's plenty of others still willing to carry Xbox hardware, though, as you can see below.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S Class Action: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Novo Investors of the Pending Class Action Lawsuit with a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 – NVO

September 25, 2025 16:40 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168894&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Title: Google Just Made Cipher Mining An AI-Crypto Hybrid Bet

Cipher Mining Inc (NASDAQ: CIFR) just landed one of the most eye-catching endorsements in crypto infrastructure: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). Google took a 5.4% stake in the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) miner, securing roughly 24 million warrants as part of a 10-year, $5 billion AI hosting deal. The structure effectively backstops $1.4 billion in financing tied to Cipher's Texas data center buildout. For investors, that transforms Cipher from a niche miner into a leveraged bet on the AI-crypto convergence. Read Also: Cipher Mining (CIFR) Stock Hit 52-Week Highs Today: What’s Going On? The timing couldn't be better. OpenAI, SoftBank and partners just unveiled a $400 billion Stargate data center initiative spanning nearly 7 GW, with two of its newest Texas sites landing right next to existing mining hubs. Shackelford County sits near IREN Ltd's (NASDAQ: IREN) 2 GW Sweetwater facility, while Milam County neighbors Riot Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ: RIOT) 700 MW Rockdale complex. SoftBank already owns ~2.65% of Cipher, tying another thread between AI buildouts and crypto infrastructure. This geographic clustering matters. Texas offers cheap power, a deregulated grid and a political climate welcoming to both AI and crypto. The overlap could create operational synergies and capital flow tailwinds for miners like Riot, IREN and Cipher as investors begin to view them less as pure bitcoin proxies and more as energy-intensive infrastructure players. What sets Cipher apart now is credibility. Google's equity exposure isn't just financial — it's a vote of confidence Cipher can deliver reliable hosting capacity at scale. That separates it from peers, giving the company access to long-duration capital while positioning it as a dual-track play: Bitcoin upside on one side, AI infrastructure on the other. For a stock that's often traded in lockstep with Bitcoin price swings, this marks a potential rerating catalyst. Cipher Mining is no longer just a high-beta Bitcoin miner — it's a call option on AI infrastructure growth in Texas. With Google and SoftBank on the cap table, and Stargate bringing massive data centers into the same energy ecosystem, the stock sits squarely at the intersection of two of the market's hottest narratives. Investors betting on Cipher Mining aren't just buying crypto exposure — they're buying into the AI-energy land grab. Read Next: Photo: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

World WASHINGTON: US lawmakers asked major companies including Apple, Amazon and JPMorgan on Thursday (Sep 25) to explain why they continue to hire thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while laying off American staff. The letter follows the Trump administration’s plan to impose a new US$100,000 annual fee on H-1B visas and rework the program to favor higher-paid and higher-skilled applicants. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin wrote to 10 major employers demanding details on the number of foreign workers they employ, their wages and whether US workers have been displaced. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the senators wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. The Wall Street Journal first reported the letter. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and other firms investing heavily in artificial intelligence have all announced layoffs this year. Yet they remain among the largest users of the H-1B program, which allows businesses to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations. Amazon and its cloud unit AWS received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas in the first half of 2025, while Microsoft and Meta had more than 5,000 approvals each, according to government data. India accounted for 71 per cent of approved H-1B beneficiaries last year, with China second at 11.7 per cent. Deloitte, Alphabet’s Google, Walmart, Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services were also among the recipients of the lawmakers’ letter. Microsoft declined to comment, while Walmart, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Cognizant did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

September 25, 2025 23 min read Computer Punch Cards, Coding Pipeline Problems, and the Future of Women in AI Carla Brodley, founding executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University, explains how to make computer science education more accessible to everyone By Katie Hafner, Laura Isensee & The Lost Women of Science Initiative Lily Whear (composite) In high school, Carla Brodley was almost shut out of computer science when boys took over all the computers. But she rediscovered her love for the field in college and has made it her mission to open doors for others. She became founding executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing, which now partners with more than 100 institutions to make computer science more accessible, at Northeastern University, where she also served as dean of Northeastern’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences from 2014 to 2921. As a result of Brodley’s work, including her push to introduce more flexible degree programs, more women—and especially, more women of color—have not only enrolled but also stayed in the field. Now, with support from Pivotal, a group of organizations founded by Melinda French Gates, Brodley is aiming to scale up her efforts. Today she joins Lost Women of Science host Katie Hafner to share her journey, new paths to computer science and the way artificial intelligence fits in.

TRANSCRIPT Carla Brodley: It turns out that because of the way our systems have worked in this country, that the people most often who've not had access to computer science in high school are the people that would, if we could make it so that they enjoyed and persisted in computer science would change the demographics. Katie Hafner: I am Katie Hafner, and welcome to the latest episode of Lost Women of Science Conversations where we talk with authors, artists, and others who've discovered and celebrated female scientists in books, poetry, film, and the visual arts. Today I'm joined by Carla Brodley. She's a computer scientist and the founding Executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University in Boston. Carla has led the center to impressive success, not only to draw more women and women of color into the study of computer science, but to retain them. The center partners with more than a hundred universities and institutions across the United States. And at those partner institutions, the number of women and people of color studying computer science who complete their degrees has increased dramatically. Today we're going to learn what's behind this success, what's next for inclusive computing and why it's all very personal for Carla Brodley. Carla, thank you so much for joining me today. Actually, in person at WBUR in Boston, one of my favorite radio stations that I grew up with, I hasten to add. Carla Brodley: I'm delighted to be here, Katie, and to talk about a subject that I love. Katie Hafner: I have to say, Carla and I go pretty much way back. We've been talking about this intractable, uh, I don't know if you'd agree with me that it's still an intractable problem of women in computing for a while. I've been writing about it for a long time, actually, since my daughter was born 32 years ago. This problem of attracting women to, and mostly retaining them. Computing and I wanted to start out by asking you your story and how you became a computer scientist. Carla Brodley: I always loved as a kid playing with blocks and building things, and I think my parents thought I was gonna be an architect because I loved math and I loved making things with my hands. And I went to high school in Bloomington, Indiana and I took a computer science class 'cause my father suggested it. And I was in ninth grade and this was a huge high school, 2000 people. And I had gym right ahead of my computer science class and. The gym was about as far from the math department as you could possibly get in this large sprawling, you know, rural high school. And I would run and I would get to the class and both computers would already be taken and there were nine other students in the class, and they were all boys and perhaps they hadn't gone through puberty yet and understood the value of the nerd girl in their future, and they did not allow me to touch the computer. And so I talked to the teacher who was a math teacher and mostly just sat there and let us do what we wanted to do, and he said I needed to work it out with the kids. So I wrote my programs by hand and I debugged them by hand and it was fun, but it was fairly discouraging and I didn't go on. Katie Hafner: Just to be clear, you wrote them and debugged them by hand and you still got an A, right? Carla Brodley: Correct. I got an A. And at that point, frankly, computer programs were fairly simple and the ones that they would have you write in grade nine were very simple. So you could do that and. We moved to Boston when I was 16. I went to a wonderful, more liberal arts focused high school, and I've always loved to read. So when I headed to McGill University, I decided to major in English and my parents rolled their eyes and tried to suggest that I do math. Katie Hafner: What a reversal that you, it's not like you wanted to do something in science and they said, no, no, no. A girl doesn't belong in science. You headed to English. Right? And they said … Carla Brodley: And they just rolled their eyes and said, you're not very good at English, you're much better at math. What are you doing? And I was rebelling as 17 year olds do. And that comes to one of the principles that I've always said as part of the work that I do. Now, why do we let 17 year olds decide who goes into tech? A 17-year-old often is making decisions that are not the best for their future. So I got to McGill and I was in my English classes and I love to read, but I don't really like to write that much. And so I didn't do very well, so I thought, well, this isn't very practical. I think I'll be an econ major. And then my roommate, who was a metallurgical engineering student, came home one day and she threw this pack of cards down on the table and she looked at me and she goes, Ugh, you would like computer science? And I thought, huh. I don't know. Maybe I would Katie Hafner: You mean a pack of computer punch cards? Carla Brodley: Yes. Uhhuh. I am that old. And for those who are much younger, a little bit about punch cards. So back when your grandparents were, um, studying computer science, the way that, um, computers worked was you had these punch cards and each row, or each column, I've forgotten now, which it was, uh. You could punch out one little part of it and then that would be. Like a letter and you'd have a whole bunch of letters, and that would be a computer instruction on each card. And then you'd have a stack of these and you'd feed them through a card reader that would look for the holes, translate that into the electrical impulses of zeros and ones, which is the language that computer understands, and from that execute the code. Katie Hafner: So punched or not punched. Punched or not punched. Mm-hmm. Carla Brodley: Now interestingly enough, if you dropped those cards on the floor, you spent a long time reordering them. Katie Hafner: Uhhuh. I can imagine. Yeah. So imagine, Carla Brodley: You know, an analogy would be you've written a paper and you've got words, and then you accidentally drop them on the floor, all the words individually, and now you have to put them back into the sentences. Not fun to drop those cards. Katie Hafner: So your roommate, whose name was. Carla Brodley: Paula Magdi. Katie Hafner: So Paula, this metallurgical engineering student, she throws these computer cards on the kitchen table and says, okay, this is something you, Carla would like, and you then Carla Brodley: It was not a compliment. Let me just make that very clear. So I thought, huh, that's interesting. So I signed up to take Fortran programming. We were on terminals. Mm-hmm. So I didn't have to do the cards. I'm not sure I would've loved computer science, had I had to do the cards, but I was able to program. By the second program, I still remember the second program was Newton's method, which is a way of mathematically solving integration. I was hooked. I was like, this is so much fun. And by the end of the semester, and it was my second semester of my second year of university, I remember calling my mother and saying, I really think I should change my major to math and computer science. And my mother was like. Well, why do you think that? I'm like, it's so exciting. It's so fun. I can't wait to do the assignments. She says, it's a no brainer. You should do this. Oh, and so I did, and it was the best decision I ever made. Now I had straight A's in everything. Katie Hafner: Okay, so this is so great hearing your story. Clearly you were inspired to use that inspiration that you had to become an educator and build an education program and a curriculum that makes computer science more inclusive and supportive. Uh, so is that correct? Carla Brodley: It is correct. When I became Dean of Cory College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern, and now I had the ability to work with the university, work with the faculty to think about how do we make it such that everybody could discover, have a sense of belonging and persist in computer science. And in particular, I also wanted to think deeply about the problem of what if I hadn't discovered computer science? What if I'd graduated with that degree in economics? But then later I discovered computer science. And that was the birth of really thinking about the Master's in computer science for people who didn't study computer science as undergraduates. And the program had already had a nascent start at the university before I got there, and they were thinking about this program as a way for people to switch fields in STEM. When I took over, I changed it to be, you could be from any field, you could be a theater major, you could be a dance major, you could be a business major. And how would we prepare you to join the direct entry Master's students? Those that came with an undergraduate degree in computer science to thrive, persist, and graduate with a master's and go work in industry. Katie Hafner: And what year was this? Carla Brodley: This was in 2014. Katie Hafner: Oh, so relatively recently. Yeah. Carla Brodley: So we started small because I wanted to make sure that companies were gonna like this type of graduate Katie Hafner: Companies, meaning those who would be hiring. Carla Brodley: Yeah. And it turned out they were more popular with companies than the students who had done computer science throughout. Katie Hafner: This is reminding me so much of kids who major in something else and then go on to get a post back for going to medical school. My own daughter majored in religious studies and went on to go to medical school and they loved her application because she had this sort of very rich different background. Do you think that's part of it? Carla Brodley: Very much so. The industry loved the diversity of thought that came from these students. This program is called the Align Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and I spoke to one of our biggest employers, which was Amazon and they told me that when you have an employee who maybe majored in English or history or something in the liberal arts and then gets a computer science degree, that their ability to think about the problems and their ability to talk about the problems is at a whole other level than someone who's just studied computer science. And then if you think about the students that maybe had an undergraduate degree in biology and chemistry, and now they have a master's in computer science with a specialty in data science. You know, who does the biotech company or the pharmaceutical company wanna hire is the person who can understand both sides of what it is they're trying to do. Katie Hafner: The very human side, and I think this is actually a good time to interject with an experienceI had recently where I gave a commencement speech at San Francisco State University to the computer science department. And when I was preparing it, I had long conversations with the chair of the department who was so kind of down in the dumps about his graduates four years ago. They enter computer science with just such high hopes and enter AI into the equation. So now these kids are having trouble finding jobs because of AI. And I said to him, should I even mention AI in the speech? He said, better not. Carla Brodley: First of all, I think that it's not clear to me that AI is what's taking the jobs, even though that makes a fancy headline. I think that we're in an interesting time where there was a lot of hiring during COVID in tech because the whole world thought we were just gonna be all tech all the time. So, I think some of the layoffs that have happened are corrections of the over hiring. And second, I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the business world right now with high interest rates and an inability to know exactly what's gonna happen with the economy. And so companies are not hiring a lot. I think that there will still be jobs. I think we're in a somewhat unique place where AI is happening at the exact same time as all of these economic factors. Katie Hafner: Interesting. Carla Brodley: And I don't think we're gonna know for another year or two whether it's actually the business environment that we're in right now, and the uncertainty around the future of business and how we're gonna proceed as a country versus how AI is impacting the workforce. So I, I think that it's an interesting time, but I do think very much so that the student that is trained in computer science and another field is gonna be the most desirable on the market. Katie Hafner: So let's talk more about that training and how CIC is changing how students are learning computer science. What do you see as the biggest barrier? When you look at a traditional computer science degree program, Carla Brodley: The number one biggest barrier for a student who's new to computer science, and that is more often women or people from races and ethnicities that have been historically minoritized in tech and students of all genders, races, and ethnicities from high schools that don't have computer science. And only 56% of our schools nationwide in the United States offer computer science in high school. And it's often an elective. And my own sons told me, taking computer science in high school was social suicide. So the only way we're gonna change who goes into computer science in high school is if it's required for all students. Katie Hafner: That's a classic pipeline problem. Carla Brodley: That is a classic pipeline problem. So now fast forward and students are in university and maybe they're interested in computer science and they walk into the class and maybe they're part of the majority group, maybe they're not, in terms of demographics and there's people that are in that classroom that are talking about, you know what they got on the AP Computer Science. They're asking questions like, is that a Boolean? Is that an inherited class? And the student who's new to computer science is sitting there and saying, “a Boolena”, what’s an inherited who? And the analogy I like to use is, imagine you're 18, you've gone to university, and you decide to take Japanese or French or Spanish, and you walk into the classroom and you look different than everybody in the classroom, and everybody else is already talking in that language. Katie Hafner: So this seems to go straight to the heart of your philosophy, which is this idea that it's not the person who's the problem, that it's the curriculum that's too rigid. That, that whole idea of a flexible curriculum, is that right? Carla Brodley: It's the system. It's the way the institution has decided to offer computer science. There are several ways to take that feeling out of the classroom. One way is to just make multiple sections of your first class. Let's call that CS one and have students self-select whether they would like to be in a class with true beginners or in a class with more experienced students. And then the key is that they learn the same things. They have the same assignments and the same exams. All you've done is remove the stress of sitting in a room with a bunch of know-it-alls. And there's a few other solutions to this problem of having this distribution of prior experience with some people having quite a bit of experience and some people completely new to coding. We have about five different approaches for universities to take. And when we work with universities, we try to figure out what's gonna work for them in terms of the approaches. Katie Hafner: Yes, because every university has its own individual sort of set of problems Carla Brodley: And what language they use and how that impacts what the AP computer science test is in, and whether they have a lot of transfer students from community college. So every university context is really important, but the principle is the same: Don't lump them all together. Katie Hafner: Right. And don't just assume everybody does the same thing. I have actually watched you in action. I followed you once to one of these universities where you met with the computer science department and you're just so good at listening. You're almost like a therapist in a way. Let's talk about required classes. Just an example: calculus for a lot of students, myself included, that class can feel incredibly intimidating. It's like organic chemistry from pre-med. It isn't essential for every computer science career, but it is required to complete the degree, and in your research, it shows up as one of the biggest roadblocks as. Especially for women. Let's not forget, we're talking here about women and the retention of women. So why is that, and what do you think could make this hurdle a little less intimidating? Carla Brodley: Only 20% of high school graduates have taken calculus, which means that the majority of people heading to university have not taken calculus. They may not even be what's called calculus ready, which means they've taken pre-calc, and so that means that students come to university. With various levels of prior math exposure and the biggest mistake the computer science department can make, whether or not they require calculus, that's not the biggest mistake. The biggest mistake is tying progression in the computer science classes to progression in the math classes. Let me be more specific, requiring calc one before they can take the first computer science class or the second computer science class as a prerequisite. As a prerequisite, that's a mistake because it's not relevant to the first class and it's maybe not that much fun versus the first computer science class which is unbelievably fun if you're gonna like computer science, Katie Hafner: Right? Carla Brodley: Not all computer scientists like calculus. Katie Hafner: Right. Yeah, that's such a good point. Like it's, so there's this really special switch that gets switched on when you are turned on a computer science. I think that's absolutely right. More after the break. Katie Hafner: Okay, so here we are talking about curricula and formal teaching. Carla, I can't do this whole episode with you without asking you about figures in history. Uh, women in computer science, in the history of computer science. For instance, one of the women we featured was Klára Dán von Neumann who knew nothing about computing because it kind of didn't even really exist when her husband, John von Neumann, sort of taught her. She did some of the very first modern style code on a computer in the 1940s. But she'd never been able to do what she ended up doing if she'd gone through all that calculus rigamarole, or she never even learned any of that. And there's another figure in history who I just found out about named Sharla Perrine Boehm. So you can tell me, have you ever heard of Sharla? Carla Brodley: I don't think so. Katie Hafner: Thank you. That's my point exactly. It turns out that she was instrumental in developing packet switching, and her name is on some of the early packet switching papers. Uh, so, excuse me. Like it was somebody who brought her to our attention. And do you think that there are a lot of women out there like her, like Klára, who did important things in computing early on, who we still need to dig and find? I would imagine so Carla Brodley: Given that I didn't know who this person was. Katie Hafner: Right? And you look so sort of chagrined and contrite, like, I'm sorry, I don't know. But of course you shouldn't be chagrined and contrite because I didn't know, and I wrote a whole book about it. And I love discovering them; and talk about persevering. I mean, these women must have done something really, um, what's the word? Uh, unusual to achieve what they achieved. And I think that what you are doing with CIC is just smoothing the way. Would you agree with that? Carla Brodley: I think that I'm helping make sustainable systemic change in the institutions themselves so that the barriers that they've unwittingly and unknowingly constructed. So, not intentionally. I don't think so. In fact, when it's explained to them why having calc one as a prereq for the first computer science class as a mistake, they get it. They just hadn't thought about it. They did not do it on purpose. So an example of a barrier is you all can try CS one and CS two, the first two classes, and you should take calc one and calc two. And then depending on your GPA, you can get the golden ticket of being the computer science major. And that's biased toward people who've already had computer science in high school and who's already had computer science in high school Katie Hafner: Boys, Carla Brodley: Asian boys in particular. Katie Hafner: Oh, interesting. Yeah, of course. The very ninth graders who wouldn't, those ninth graders Carla Brodley: That wouldn't let me touch the computer. Katie Hafner: Uh, okay. So I hear you wanna make a sustainable, inclusive computer science program at institutions all over the country. What real world results have you seen so far? Carla Brodley: So there are 50 universities offering or about to offer the bridge to the Master's program for people who didn't study computer science. And so that means that those people will be new to computer science and they will come from all, you know, demographic identities, and that's really exciting. And at the undergraduate level, at the schools that we've worked with for long enough to be able to have measurable results, which are, uh, 21 of our 35 schools that we've worked deeply with at the undergraduate level, we have seen incredible increases in groups that have been historically underrepresented in tech and in particular, one of my favorite statistics is African American women from fall of 19 to fall of 2023, have gone up by 136% and yet wait 136. And you could say, well, that's because maybe the number was very small, but that's 455 net new Black women in computer science at these 21 universities. Katie Hafner: That's pretty incredible. Yeah. So hats off to you. So what are some other new initiatives that you're working on that you're excited about? Carla Brodley: I'm super excited about two new initiatives, and both of them are really designed to make people versatile in today's world. There are also ways to help students discover computer science because if I hadn't had that experience where my roommate insulted me into trying it, I would've never discovered it. Katie Hafner: Shout out to Paula. Thank you, Paula. And so I started thinking about this, and when I got to Northeastern there was this idea of a combined major. And when I looked at this, we had 12 of them when I joined as Dean in 2014. And they were all the things that computer scientists thought made sense. And I was like, such as? Physics and computer science, electrical engineering and computer science. Math and computer science. And then there was this one design and computer science in our college of arts, media and design. And I saw that all the demographic diversity was in that one, especially the gender diversity. And I thought about it and I'm like computer sciences for everyone and everything. And so during my time as Dean, I added 36 more, like English and computer science, cybersecurity, criminal justice, data science in every field of stem. And now, fast forward to today, these programs kept growing. We have 46 different interdisciplinary majors. Katie Hafner: Really Carla Brodley: Over 50% of our students are now pursuing these interdisciplinary degrees. They're very popular with industry. Again, these students get hired at the juncture of their fields or in one or the other of their two fields. I wanted to take this idea out to other universities to show that it could be done at large, complicated public universities of all sorts. So we created a portfolio of universities. We have eight of them in the portfolio. They're in different parts of the country. They're different types of universities. Some are top ranked universities in computer science, some are flagship, some are more open access, and we're working with them to do all of the work under the hood to enable these interdisciplinary majors. And we have several of these universities starting offering this fall and others are on track for next fall. And offering these interdisciplinary majors like computer science and neuroscience, um, psychology and computer science. Katie Hafner: That's fascinating. So tell me about the second initiative you're excited about. Carla Brodley: Well, I think it's on everybody's lips right now: AI Katie Hafner: uhhuh Carla Brodley: And thinking about how do we make sure that women are going into technical AI education, or all people are going into technical AI education. Some of the things we're thinking about are: can we create specialized math classes for AI that don't take the same amount of time as going through the topics sequentially in the math department. To really do machine learning, you need to have ideas from calc one, from calculus two, from linear algebra and probability and statistics. Katie Hafner: But not everything. Carla Brodley: But not everything. And not necessarily the way the math department would teach them with the proofs. We need to know how to apply them and to understand them in computer science. And so we're starting to think about an initiative where people create math for CS, math for AI classes as part of this initiative otherwise students can't take their first AI class until their fifth, sixth, or seventh semester in university, and that's too late. We're also thinking about how do you bring AI into the very first courses so people can see the applicability of machine learning algorithms perhaps in medicine. Or in science or in the digital humanities, Katie Hafner: And you just got a really wonderful, large investment. Tell us about that. Carla Brodley: We just received a wonderful gift to support our initiatives both around the systemic change in undergraduate programs and in particular around the systemic changes needed to be made in AI from Pivotal, which is Melinda French Gates's organization, where they've really, really invested in women in, in innovation and tech. Katie Hafner: Shout out to Melinda French Gates and Pivotal, for doing that. I mean, she has done tremendous work in helping women thrive in the workplace, right? Carla Brodley: She's one of my heroes. We have been very fortunate to get an investment substantial enough that we'll be able to move the needle in AI across many universities in this country. Katie Hafner: That is amazing. I don't wanna be a Debbie Downer here, but it does make me sad to think about other sources of funding that have been drying up. I don't think we can have this conversation without talking about that. So many of these publicly funded initiatives are suffering. What are your thoughts on not just that in general, but about the backlash against diversity and equity efforts? Carla Brodley: I think that it, there are many ways to achieve diversity and equity in terms of initiatives, and the CIC has always focused on fixing the system rather than doing things around individuals. And it turns out that when you fix the system, you often get the results that you're hoping for. We didn't do anything specific for black women and yet they went up by 136%. We just stopped doing things that don't work for true beginners. And true beginners can be white men as well. And so it benefits everybody. So there's things that we can be doing that are not program or individual demographic specific that will change it and make it better. Katie Hafner: Have you had to go back as so many others have and scrub out some of this language on your website? Words like inclusive, and obviously you can't because it's in your name. Carla Brodley: We kept inclusive because we really mean inclusive in its largest sense. We include everybody. We include white men from every state in this country. Right? It really is inclusive. We always had the mission that we wouldn't work with any particular group. That was always my desire. It was to open up new pathways so that people who had felt excluded could come in, but people who didn't feel excluded but just hadn't noticed it yet could come in as well. Katie Hafner: So to wrap up, I wanted to ask you to give advice to educators at all levels, whether it's primary education all the way up to advanced degrees. What would be your best advice when it comes to opening up young minds? Carla Brodley: I would say look at the systems and the regulations and the way in which you're offering your programs, and think about whether you really have a door that's open to everybody to explore, to discover, and to persist in whatever makes their heart sing, and to make no assumptions that someone who's new to a field isn't good at the field. Katie Hafner: Well, Carla Brodley, I would like to thank you so much for coming on to lost Women of Science Conversations to talk to us about this extremely important topic and all that you're doing. Carla Brodley: Katie, it's been my pleasure to be here with you. And I just wanna share a little personal anecdote that last night my book group met and because I told them you were interviewing me, we decided to listen to the very first season of Lost Women of Science as our book for this session. And we spoke about it last night and oh my God, two of us are scientists that are in the group, and we talked about Rachel Maddow's you know dude Wall and and the two of us that were scientists who had leadership positions shared that we weren't on the dude wall and had to advocate for ourselves to get up there. And I just wanted to say thank you, not only for today, but for the wonderful discussion that we had last night at my book group. Katie Hafner: That's so nice to hear. And just to clarify, the dude wall refers to all the portraits that you see when you go into, say, a museum or a university or a medical school of all the basically white men who are up on the wall. And thank you so much. What a very nice thing that your book group did that. And with that, I would like to thank you for that and also so much for coming on Lost Women of Science Conversations.

Posted on 09/25/2025 9:52:42 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Big U.S. companies are facing heightened scrutiny from Capitol Hill over their use of foreign employees on H-1B visas, with lawmakers raising concerns about layoffs and slumping job prospects for Americans. On Wednesday evening, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) sent letters to the country’s largest users of H-1B visas—including Amazon, Apple and JPMorgan Chase—asking them to explain why they continue to hire thousands of H-1B visa holders while also cutting other jobs. The senators asked for detailed information on how many H-1B workers the companies employ, what wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. The letters cited reporting by the Journal about the weak tech job market. The move comes less than a week after President Trump announced an overhaul of the H-1B program, including a new $100,000 fee for companies sponsoring foreign workers. That move caused panic for some companies worried they could retroactively be on the hook for fee payments. They mobilized HR teams and lawyers to address employee concerns and ensure compliance. The H-1B system, created in 1990, is the primary pathway for foreign professionals to work in the U.S. Roughly 700,000 people currently live in the country on H-1B visas, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data, with technology firms among the biggest users. Most H-1B holders are from India and China. Amazon, the largest H-1B sponsor in the U.S., won approval for more than 14,000 new hires on the visa in fiscal 2025—the most of any company—even as it has announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of jobs in recent years.

In turn FOD contracted with a body shop to do the actual design and coding of the Voter Registration system used in 2020. The body shop allegedly had its bodies in CT to do the work for GA. But only 2 of the 20+ on the project were actually in CT. Repeatedly the body in CT had to fly to India for the funeral of a grandmother or grandfather. We used to joke about how many funerals he attended. He would get on the phone meeting from India. It was clear he was in the same room as all his developers. And when he was on a phone call from CT it was clear he was not in the same room as his developers. In all the discussion of the 2020 election in GA I am the only one who has been pointing this out for over 10 years now. Others discussing the 2020 GA election never mention that the software was developed by those who did not live in, nor understood the laws and customs of the US or GA. Until the complex relationships, often times intentionally complex, are discussed completely, the partial nips are going to be effective? PS in the 2015-2019 period the GA voter registration story was fed to only 2 GA media personalities, as far as I know...Phil and Eric. 17 posted on 09/25/2025 11:05:59 AM PDT by spintreebob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Frank Drebin They’ll investigate until payment is made.

The move comes less than a week after President Trump announced an overhaul of the H-1B program, including a new $100,000 fee for companies sponsoring foreign workers. That move caused panic for some companies worried they could retroactively be on the hook for fee payments. They mobilized HR teams and lawyers to address employee concerns and ensure compliance. The H-1B system, created in 1990, is the primary pathway for foreign professionals to work in the U.S. Roughly 700,000 people currently live in the country on H-1B visas, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data, with technology firms among the biggest users. Most H-1B holders are from India and China. Amazon, the largest H-1B sponsor in the U.S., won approval for more than 14,000 new hires on the visa in fiscal 2025—the most of any company—even as it has announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of jobs in recent years.

End the entire program. It’s a scam from top to bottom and side to side. L Why? Cause they lie and game the system - with the full support of the renegade congress. https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4342356/posts “Hey, marcus, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know. Like your pal Engraved” “Hey, marcus, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know. Like your pal Engraved” 700,000 is a lie. Think multiples of that. Try looking for an official number. There is no official number. This is a news media “talking point” number. Agreed, end it now. “Roughly 700,000 people currently live in the country on H-1B visas, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data, with technology firms among the biggest users. Most H-1B holders are from India and China.” It’s obscene. As a company’s citizen workforce is trimmed, the exact number of their H1b slots should expire at the same time. Think about all the anchor babies spawned, too. Agreed Just like they claimed we had 11 million illegals for 25 years. If the democrat Senators didn’t have the chamber room they wouldn’t have a place to get some sleep after hammering booze in the buildings bar. They claim it is to get workers that they can’t find in the US which is a bald face lie. They get them to drive down wages of Americans doing that job. “how many H-1B workers the companies employ, what wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process.” If the role of consultants is not explicitly included, the numbers mean nothing. There are 2 levels of consulting. Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, etal “consult”. In turn these “consulting companies” contract with “body shops” who provide the bodies. The “body shops” are often layered 3 or 5 deep. Also of interest is the location of the bodies. Example: GA Secretary of State contracted with FOD-Friends of Dodd to get HAVA money. In turn FOD contracted with a body shop to do the actual design and coding of the Voter Registration system used in 2020. The body shop allegedly had its bodies in CT to do the work for GA. But only 2 of the 20+ on the project were actually in CT. Repeatedly the body in CT had to fly to India for the funeral of a grandmother or grandfather. We used to joke about how many funerals he attended. He would get on the phone meeting from India. It was clear he was in the same room as all his developers. And when he was on a phone call from CT it was clear he was not in the same room as his developers.

Trading giant Jane Street now owns 5.9% in Opendoor Technologies, the online real-estate platform that has become a favorite of retail traders. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Jane Street said its stake in Opendoor (OPEN) amounted to around 44 million shares, translating to a value of roughly $362 million based on Wednesday’s closing price Jane Street is known for its sophisticated high-frequency trading systems. It's unclear if the investment is a bet on the company or marks a hedging position. Opendoor has become a meme stock, bought by retail investors on the back of social media hype, while Jane Street is a big institutional firm famed for its sophisticated trading systems. Jane Street's investment shows the home-buying firm is on the radar of large investors. Opendoor shares were up more than 8% in recent trading. They have been on a tear since July as retail investors piled in and have gained 450% so far this year. Its shares soared earlier this month after the company brought in former Shopify (SHOP) COO Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO, brought its founders onto the board, and got an infusion of cash. Like most of its meme stock peers including GameStop (GME), the video-game retailer that defined the craze in 2021, Opendoor is unprofitable and is also heavily shorted by hedge funds. Wall Street is broadly negative on Opendoor, with four of six analysts tracked by Visible Alpha issuing "sell" ratings and the other two with "hold" calls. The mean price target of analysts surveyed by VA is $1.02, versus its share price close yesterday of $8.23.

Update font size. Reset U.S. lawmakers have asked major U.S. companies including Apple, Amazon, and JPMorgan on Thursday to explain why they are hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while cutting other jobs. Reuters: ‎ The letter comes after the Trump administration announced last week that it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas, which allow businesses to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The U.S. has also released a proposal that would rework the H-1B visa selection process to favor higher-skilled and better-paid workers. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, asked 10 major employers for detailed information on the number of H-1B workers they employ, the wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the senators wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: India will come to the table on trade and this will be the bargaining chip that swings the deal. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com. Thank you! Support MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon. If a company is firing more than 2-3% of their workers in any sector, they should not get H-1B visas for that sector. (Fire all the HR, marketing, and advertising execs you want, but not highly trained, experienced positions.) H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed at least a median wage for that position. Maybe the government should insist that H-1B visa holders are always in the 80th percentile or something. H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed third party mediation if they suspect their wages aren’t competitive. H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed some kind of freedom of movement if they can show their compensation is not competitive. Companies shouldn’t be able to kick H-1B workers to the curb if they point out any kind of exploitation. Any company accepting H-1B workers in any department, can’t fire or “retire” workers in that department for 2-3 years. $100K seems excessive–after all, we do want the best and brightest to come to the USA—but in no way should H-1B visas be allowed to artificially depress workers compensation. No company should be able to have more than 5% of its employees on H-1B visas. Companies asking for H-1B visas must offer significant scholarships, apprenticeships, or work-study programs to American employees to acquire the education/training/degrees necessary in those areas which they claim lack qualified American workers. Companies asking for H-1B visas must donate significant resources to local schools to enhance or kick-start programs in those fields which they claim lack qualified American workers and work closely with those schools to provide apprenticeship programs. Also this: In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with US President Barack Obama, complained about the nation’s shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was “headed for a one-term presidency”. Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done … It infuriates me” The $100K fee should be yearly.

September 25, 2025 11:20 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In Novo To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in Novo between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Trump's new H-1B visa fee could cost companies a lot more than $100K. Here's the potential impact across industries.

Hello, and RIP to Instagram (sort of). The app is testing out a new feed that opens right into its Reels feature. BI's Katie Notopoulos has more on the change. In other tech news, OpenAI's Sam Altman (yes, the Sam Altman) stopped by the Berlin headquarters of our parent company, Axel Springer. He chatted with the father of quantum computing, and they agreed on a Turing Test 2.0. In today's big story, we're looking at how President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee will impact Big Tech, startups, consulting, and Wall Street. What's on deck: Markets: The future of trading is … doing it in person. Wait, what? Tech: The startups making big money by training AI with humans. Business: Costco's new exclusive hours are proving to be a boon for the business. But first, the price of hiring just went up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The dust is still settling on President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee, but one thing seems clear: Corporate America is in for a shake-up. Late last week, Trump sent businesses into a bit of a tailspin when he announced that each H-1B visa, which allows companies to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized roles, would come with a $100,000 fee. There was some initial confusion about whether that fee applied to current visa holders (it doesn't). But even with the focus only on new visa applicants, the impact is still expected to be big. JPMorgan economists predict the US will see work authorizations drop by 5,500 a month. Business leaders continue to weigh in, with reactions ranging from optimism to concern. And while a lot still remains unknown, we're getting a sense of what it means for different industries. Here's a breakdown on how the new fee could impact some of the industries that rely on the H-1B visa the most. Big Tech: Tech giants are some of the biggest users of H-1B visas, so you'd think the new fee would hurt them the most. But size matters. When your company is worth more than $1 trillion, an extra $100,000 won't move the needle. In fact, you could argue that Big Tech would welcome the fee if it served as a deterrent to smaller competitors going after the same talent. Still, it's not all good news. The scale at which Big Tech companies hire workers on H-1B visas means the costs could eventually add up to billions of dollars for top sponsors. Startups: It's easy to think of startups as high-flying companies with lofty valuations, but the vast majority of them are simply small businesses. And without the deep pockets of their larger peers, startups could be left scrambling in the all-important war for talent. Even if a startup is willing to pay the $100,000 fee, it will almost certainly only do it for the most senior-level employees who have the skills and salary to justify the cost. You could argue that was the original intent of the visa, but the change could also upend the pipeline of young talent working at startups. Consulting: When it rains, it pours. Consultants aren't in a position of power, as we've covered here before, and the fee certainly won't help things. Simply put, consulting is experiencing a talent crisis, and any additional hurdle is likely to make it worse. In some cases, like data scientists and other highly technical roles, the competition for talent will just increase. However, building out offshore hubs in places like India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Argentina, which was already a trend, could be another option to bypass the visa issue entirely, analysts told BI. Wall Street: Financial firms aren't too far behind Big Tech when it comes to using H-1B visas. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup each have more than a 1,000 certified H-1B filings. However, the calculation of H-1Bs on the Street is different than in Big Tech. A majority of financial firms' H-1B visa roles are focused on technology. And as much as banks and investment firms value their digital transformations, techies aren't as high in the hierarchy as money makers like traders, investment bankers, and wealth managers. Still, the visa feel will be felt on the Street, especially when it comes to Wall Street's junior banker hiring. 1. This retail investing platform wants to take trading IRL. Moomoo is opening a physical retail store in 2026, located in NYC's Herald Square. With human employees there to help, its CEO sees the storefront as an opportunity to increase brand trust and community engagement. 2. The US economy's greatest strength could turn out to be investors' biggest weakness. America's economic resilience has allowed it to escape many recession forecasts over the years. But that could create a blind spot, financial pros told BI. One strategist said investors' complacency is reminiscent of the 1990s. 3. This lowkey billionaire is the real winner of the new iPhone launch. Wang Laisheng's company, Luxshare Precision Industry, started out making accessories for Apple. Now, it assembles iPhones — and the recent iPhone 17 launch sent its stock spiking 32% and Laisheng's net worth to $14.3 billion. The success has even OpenAI knocking on its door. 1. AI companies are shelling out for human trainers. Companies are raising billions to recruit humans to teach chatbots everything from Japanese to finance to memes. Workers can earn hundreds of dollars an hour at some of these companies. See which startups are cashing in. 2. Post-IPO is not the time to rest on your laurels. As Klarna's staff celebrated its $15 billion IPO at its employee conference in Stockholm, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski shared a stark text he received from chairman Michael Moritz: Klarna was still "10 years behind" a competitor. 3. Keep your friends close. Abridge became a $5.3 billion darling of healthcare tech with the help of medical records giant Epic. Now, Epic is releasing its own tech to compete with Abridge's AI medical scribe. It shows how partners and former shareholders can quickly become competitors. 1. Where does Trump vs. Kimmel go next? It's possible that the president will simply move on from his beef with Kimmel. But regardless of the aftermath, we should still take the whole ordeal seriously, writes BI's Peter Kafka. It's also shown Corporate America that there's one line it can't cross when it comes to free speech. 2. Costco is proving the haters wrong. Some employees were concerned that Costco's plans to open stores early for its executive members would backfire. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai says otherwise. The data indicates that the extended hours are getting customers to shop faster and more frequently. 3. Trump's economic holy trinity is a tough nut to crack. The president has three economic goals: boost US manufacturing, crack down on immigration, and keep prices low. These work fine on their own, or even in pairs, but many economists and trade experts say Trump can't accomplish all three at once. Here's why. Luigi Mangione's federal judge orders DOJ to stop making prejudicial pretrial statements after Trump retweets. Jimmy Kimmel's comeback show reached 6.26 million viewers, Disney says. Sean Combs launched a jailhouse 'Free Game with Diddy' course to teach fellow inmates business skills: lawyers. Disney investors demand internal records on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, say the board may have breached duties. Honda ends production of its Acura EV in the US, citing 'market conditions.' Nexstar says it's 'engaged in productive discussions' with Disney but won't show Jimmy Kimmel yet. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York.

InfoQ Homepage Presentations Panel: Next Generation Inclusive UIs The panelists discuss creating inclusive XR environments. They explain how to prioritize accessibility in user testing, the importance of designing for diverse users from day one, and how team culture and modular UIs can foster innovation. They also highlight the business case for making accessibility a core part of an MVP to avoid technical debt. Erin Pañgilinan is Spatial Computing, AI Leader and author of "Creating Augmented and Virtual Realities: Theory and Practice for Next-Generation Spatial Computing". Colby Morgan is Technical Director @Mighty Coconut. Dylan Fox is Director of Operations @XR Access, previously UC Berkeley researcher & UX designer, expert on Accessibility for Emerging Technologies. Software is changing the world. QCon San Francisco empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Doyle: We're going to do a Q&A panel. We're going to dig in a little bit more on how augmented, virtual, and extended, and mixed reality unlock the ability to integrate the power of computers more seamlessly into our physical three-dimensional world. Designing that user experience of these next generation UIs to be as inclusive as possible comes with a lot of challenges. We're going to sit down and talk about what are some of the insights and strategies for creating more inclusive and accessible XR environments. Our speakers today, we have Colby Morgan, we've got Dylan Fox, and Erin Pañgilinan. How does the process of user testing differ when accessibility is a priority, and what are some best practices? Erin Pañgilinan: My friend, who's a co-founder of my previous non-profit that I co-founded with her for women that were working in ARVR, it was called ARVR Academy, Suzanne Leibrick, who used to actually be in Mixed Reality at Intel at the time, she talks about the concept of gameplay testing. If you really think about even in like AI development, you're not going to start with the most gigantic foundation model and the most amount of data. You're going to start off with something really small and simple and test it on 10 people. What I always encourage people to do since 2016 is to try as many different VR or AR, XR, demos as much as possible. When you're actually developing for a single experience, you're going to start with maybe just a few interactions at a single level and see if it works with actual people. If you get more than 60%, maybe you're in a good range. A lot of the time you'll actually try it in a bunch and you'll realize, this actually doesn't work. That way you're saving a lot of time when you're gameplay testing. That's the first thing I would say. It's pretty easy. It's just most people who haven't developed for games before, like I said in the background, but it's also in AI, in that space that haven't done it, I think you're going to always rapidly prototype the smallest MVP possible. Dylan Fox: I think for me, one of the challenges that we see with XR, as opposed to more mobile and desktop technology, is that it generally assumes that most people have either a desktop or a mobile phone at home, and that they are able to turn these on and operate them and use the application, often remotely, without necessarily needing any external help. If you want to have inclusive XR experiences, the unfortunate reality right now is that there are a lot of people who would be interested in using these, but may not have a headset at home, and even if they did have a headset at home, may not be able to take it out, get through the setup process, and put it on themselves and activate your application independently. Something that I noticed when I was running the experiments we did at UC Berkeley on using the HoloLens for low vision folks, is that these systems were not necessarily created with the idea that the person who is in the experience may not be the one who is operating the experience. I would love to see more support for experimenters, more support for caretakers. There's a lot of times, especially with new technology like XR, where you want to empower the person who is wearing the headset to just focus on the experience, and you want to offload some of that setup and execution to somebody who is helping them on the side. Making sure that you have those good tools, so that if I'm trying to run an experiment or user test for somebody who is totally blind, I can hand them the headset, they can put it on, and then I can get them into the application, get them set up, and monitor their progress. That's something that's not super well supported right now. It would be lovely to see better support for it. Colby Morgan: Especially when it comes to accessibility, I think that trying to get that early in your process, so as you're developing those features, it's part of your design process early on as well. Again, you're having opportunities to develop or solve issues before they become issues, especially when it comes to accessibility. I think a lot of it is just that early mindset, too. Accessibility and inclusive design is really about good design in general, so just really trying to make good products and good experiences that have a lot of that baked in. Again, you're reducing the amount that you have to do later on down the pipeline. I think, especially for user testing, obviously it's a really critical part of that, and so I think as much as possible trying to work with your users or the communities, people that can really give you the solid feedback about the accessibility tools that you may be working on or integrating. I think the big thing I always think about, too, is it's really easy to check a box or just get a feature in that it checks the box and does the bare minimum of it, but a lot of times finding what's giving users value is really critical to that step, and especially with XR in general. Again, it's such an immersive technology, and so you just want to make sure that the tools that you're putting in actually provide value for users. Erin Pañgilinan: My friend Nathan Ventura, who co-founded a company called Vinci Games, so he's YC backed. He's doing VR basketball. His game, Blacktop Hoops, when I first tried it, it was literally just like, here's the environment and shoot a basketball. He didn't have characters yet, which is now tied to a lot of IP and film, but I actually had, it was a demo at the Philippine Consulate, so he's Filipino, I'm Filipino. One of our other friends, he's number two in the world at combat design for Street Fighter, but he's a combat designer in most games. He probably played everything on every console, X-Men. I asked him, I was like, how was it? Did you break presence when you tried this? He's like, I didn't, but when I actually tried it, second time, I broke presence, which is something really common when you have VR, is like, I feel like I'm really in this environment, but it skips too much, or it'll have the most buggy things. You'll do a ton of work, but in practice, when you find out, I've spent maybe hundreds of hours developing this game, and find out it doesn't work. Another one I'll mention is a friend, Jazmin Cano, who actually has a chapter in my book. She's a technical 3D artist and an accessibility products manager. Her game, which was from Owlchemy Labs, so they were acquired by Google. If you've ever played Vacation Simulator or Job Simulator, this was their latest version. We tried it at Meta Connect, and most basic thing, Wi-Fi doesn't work. When we think about design, obviously Dylan's work focused a lot on differently-abled or disabled folks, and you're trying to expand the amount of diverse content creators, trying to get as inclusive as possible with your design. When it comes right down to it, it's not just good design, it's just basic engineering and functionality of Wi-Fi is not working at Meta, and so when I'm playing in this headset, I hear voices of other headsets being mixed together in a multiplayer environment with only less than 10 people. I'm like, that's pretty bad. That's not the fault of Owlchemy. It might have been the event people who were organizing at this conference. I like to think of gameplay testing in every type of environment, no matter how big or small. It's the one thing I'll say lastly, too. With Horizon, if you thought about during the pandemic, you're watching Meta Connect in VR, you could probably have hundreds of voices, but once you scale to thousands of people attending, couldn't really do that. Same idea. It's also just basic engineering when you think about latency and functionality at the end of the day, not just good design, but basic practices, and like, does this work or not? Doyle: How do we ensure that inclusivity and accessibility are integral parts of the UI design process from day one rather than add it on later when we maybe find it in testing? Colby Morgan: I think part of that is, it touches back to the culture of a team and just making sure that the team behind it, the team behind the designs, the UI, the concept, the development, have a lot of those concepts. Part of their workflows, and everyone's on the same page as far as what you're working towards. The culture is part of that. For me, XR is such an immersive technology, and the social presence and the connection is such a huge part of that, and so you want to make that as inclusive as possible and as easy as possible to get into. I think for a lot of people, XR is just a lot. It can be a cognitive overload of trying to get into an experience. Obviously, it takes over your vision and all that. I think just, again, leaning back to just good XR design to make things simple and easy to operate and easy to get people in regardless of their experience level, because I think with every new technology there's always going to be people that are new to it, and there's always going to be that struggle. Again, just relying on those designs that make it really easy to get people in and participating. Dylan Fox: I think the single biggest thing in my mind to make sure that you have accessibility on the radar from the start is simply to have folks with disabilities on your team. If you're part of an organization that has a lot of folks with disabilities, then it's naturally going to be a part of the conversation, because you aren't going to ship something that doesn't work for your own people. Failing that, making sure you have people with disabilities in the loop as early and as frequently as possible way before you get to the alpha, like part of the design process, is just going to be really important. I think another thing that we often talk about when it comes to just the cold, hard cash of development is that it is far cheaper to build something in than to retrofit it. If you get to launch, you get to beta testing, and then you find out, actually, it's not accessible, we need to do this screen reader, or we need to be able to scale our UI. That is way easier to do when you're first building it out than after you have a million interconnected systems that it breaks. If you ever think accessibility is going to be an issue for your game, your app, your organization, which it probably will be if you ever get successful enough, then it's better to think about it from the start and save yourself a whole lot of time and headache and money and have just a better product right from the get-go. Erin Pañgilinan: I put Dylan on all of those points when you think about the end user itself, and thinking about different senses we're targeting. We saw a talk with Google AR, like how do visually impaired people see and not see. If you're mute, that's completely different. If you're someone that does not have an arm, you're not going to have a hand controller or a hand. These are really difficult challenges. Something really basic which I opened in my talk was with avatars. I was actually talking with Jazmin about the entire process of the app. She's like, what? You skipped over my entire part at the very beginning of like, create an avatar. I started off as a bald, it looked like a Nigerian man. I remember the very early prototypes for Oculus, by default, I was a very tall golden man. It was only metallic colors. I was like, I don't really identify with this, but it's really cool. I love Jeremy Bailenson's work, but it is a little problematic to say like, I can achieve empathy because now I can have blackface on. I'm like, that's not what this is for. To be culturally relevant I want an avatar or an agent that looks like me. One of the other user tests I've actually been doing at Meta, I can't say too much about it, but they ask you about skin color. I was like, that's really new and interesting. They never have asked that before. I think they are, at least some of the market leaders in headsets and manufacturing, just trying to think of, how are we being inclusive of more people that are end users, not just the people creating the products? That was never thought of I think five years ago, it was just like, that was a throwaway and a nice to have. Now it's like, we're actually thinking about this first. That wasn't the case. Also, in the game for Owlchemy Labs that we played at Meta Connect, I was talking to her about like, teleporting is really different. Previously you had to have a controller, whether you're using HTC VIVE or anything in the Oculus and Meta ecosystem, now it was all hands. It made me think like, but I don't naturally teleport by putting my hand out to go to the next portal. Is that the most inclusive UI if you don't have a hand? It really depends who you're targeting. I think you need to think about, who is that type of user? What senses do they have and prefer? I wouldn't say there's just flat-out bad design. There's just different points of accessibility that people identify with. The last thing I'll mention to you from the AI community is for black women or brown folks like myself. I'm a light-skinned, privileged Filipino woman. I will say, people don't trust AI that are black. Straight up, why? Because the algorithms, if you look at it, basic recognition for imaging on skin. It's why I'll go to the bathroom and my air blow dryer will work or water, but that won't work previously. This is because accessibility is not thought of. It's the last thing on the list for AI developers. For XR it was a little bit better. It still was at first. We weren't design inclusive by default. I think that's now changing. It's going to take a lot more work, I think, to be much more inclusive. Not just the content and the people developing it. Thinking on base level, what is the data and input that a machine is taking in? What's the sensory input that I'm receiving? You're thinking about I/O. What's the input and output on each end, inputting and receiving? I don't think that was thought of very critically before. It's definitely transformed and changed over a number of years. Doyle: What role does team culture play in building these accessible UIs? How do we foster a culture that values feedback and diverse perspectives? Colby Morgan: I think part of that is really focusing on getting a diverse team, so you have a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences to pull on from your team. As Dylan was pointing out, it's like, if you have a lot of different perspectives on your team, you can identify a lot of those things. It becomes easier, even as a culture element, if you have just a diverse team, to keep that top of mind with a lot of those different aspects. I'd say the diverse teams. Dylan Fox: I think in addition to the team, one thing you can do is spotlight your users and other stakeholders that are of different backgrounds, different abilities. We had a project with XR Access called the Stories Project, where we interviewed a number of disabled folks that had used XR, had an interest in it, enjoyed it, but obviously ran into challenges in using it. One thing we wanted to do was just spotlight those experiences. Because I think it's very easy for people to assume that everyone who uses a certain app is like themselves. I think we don't tend to think about people that aren't like ourselves unless we see some evidence that they exist. If you can spotlight those people that exist outside the norm and help to normalize that, this is for everybody. It's not just for your standard, usually in tech it's the standard cishet white dude. Then that can also be really helpful in making sure that your team doesn't just see this diversity of opinion in the team, but also in the people that you're creating for. Erin Pañgilinan: Outside of the obvious ones like race, gender, class, ethnicity, language, region is really important. In any application, interface is to me web development, not even XRs. It's like, how many different types of phones are there in the Philippines, for example? How many different screen sizes do I need to design for? I'll never be an Android developer, that's like too many. I was hardcore iOS for a really long time for a lot of different reasons. I think when you're thinking about targeting, accessibility, by default, it's a population and region. Outside of that, I also consider the type of discipline on the team. For a really long time with game design, it was only people who were AAA developers can be in XR. That was highly biased, especially for third-party independent developers like myself. I did not have that experience. I had a previous life in another career. There's a lot of bias there. Outside of non-traditional backgrounds, what I would say is it's actually not engineers to me that made the best experiences in VR in particular, it was architects. People who actually have an understanding of 3D space. When you think about AI, it's not necessarily machine learning engineers that have a statistics PhD and background. That used to be the case. I actually think psychologists have a lot to say. Cognitive scientists, anyone who actually works in real science and in the brain in life sciences, there's a lot that's to be worked on there if you're trying to achieve, to me, AGI or consciousness, when you think about presence in VR. I like to think of not just explicit insert my XYZ race, that they say, insert your identity here. I also think diversity and discipline of what you focus on is actually really valuable. That's now changing. The barrier to entry for people is also dropping. A lot of the classes I did teach from 2016 and on was everything from K-12 of students using Google Cardboard to employees at Cisco that were developing early prototypes for enterprise. We weren't getting people who were core C# developers. They were just anyone that worked as an engineer that was trying to think about, how do I think about networking and learning from first-person shooter games, but applying it at game design that's essentially B2C in a B2B environment. There's a lot of things that are cross-disciplinary by default that can make things more inclusive and new ways that you can put a lot of things together intersectionally that will create new and exciting experiences and that will actually be more inclusive. Not just, who's creating it because you're a cis straight white man and you're overrepresented. Instead of like, I think about Dylan as his expertise being like, you're focusing on populations that typically you wouldn't think of, or would be playing in an experience that is the most cutting edge and new that is by default much more human and accessible. Whether it's speech, voice, NLP, whether it's sensory, touch, gesture, get to the lowest common denominator of who cannot access those things. By targeting those audiences, I'm not going to say it's because it's a queer, trans black woman that is disabled. It's like, that's who you should target. I'm saying, if you actually support and target those things and put those people on your teams, they're probably going to have ten times richer the amount of experience, not because of who they are, but because of the disciplines that they have to think about and how they design, how they interact with the experience. Then on top of that, they're going to layer, here's my knowledge and statistics about why this doesn't work for this population and why that's not culturally relevant for my community, and why it does or does not work. It's actually multilayered. It isn't just straight up like, I'm going to hire a woman. Because of that, automatically it's going to be more diverse and automatically it's going to be a great experience. No, you can't take it at face value. It is much more deeper and multilayered in this process when we think about the words diversity. Diversity, not just like token Asian face, or token affirmative action card. It's really about like, what are you bringing to the table that is different and new and a different paradigm that you're contributing to innovation? Colby Morgan: One of the things I think I'll add too, with that, I think the other element of getting your team, but also just making sure that there's opportunities and everyone feels empowered to have a voice on your team, too. That's one thing, especially with new people on our team, we have to go through a phase of getting them really comfortable with giving feedback and feeling empowered to give feedback. Especially so you have a team where, again, I feel like a lot of projects and early in a project, it can be really easy to fall into a design hole or code silo where you're really focused and you almost don't want to get feedback because you're like, I'm really focused on this. I don't want to get some of that feedback. A big part of just having that culture that is open to feedback and everyone's empowered to give feedback on each of those steps, because I think there's a lot of those friction points that people run into that they just don't say anything. It's really easy, especially when you're working on XR experiences or features, it's really easy just to gloss over, it's like, that was hard, but I'm not going to really pay attention to it. Just making sure that everyone can call those things out, and really, it's like, yes, everyone was having a really hard time with this. We should actually try to make this better. Doyle: Then, how do you design UIs that adapt to individual users' needs and preferences? What are the current limitations you're seeing and where do you see this heading? Dylan Fox: I think the number one rule in my mind that I discussed earlier is that principle of modularity. You should have interfaces where the different inputs and the different outputs can all be done in multiple different ways. To our really great example of this, you can look at "The Last of Us Part II", which had an incredible suite of accessibility functions where people could do en masse, give me the hearing suite, give me the vision suite, but then tweak individual things. They would have any key thing, let's say there's like a scrap of material on the ground you can use to scavenge and use in crafting. If you turn the accessibility feature on, it wouldn't just light up, it would also make a sound, or the controller would vibrate. There is any number of ways where you could get that multi-modal feedback. I think making sure that your systems are modular like that, that you're thinking about things, and even things that maybe not what necessarily you think of as something that needs that. Things like eye contact in social VR, if I can set it so that I can literally feel everybody's eyes on me if they're all watching me, that could be a really powerful thing. This is also an area where I'm really excited for AI, because the ability for people to just say to the machine, make this thing bigger, or, can you outline X for me, and just adjust their experience on the fly, would be incredibly powerful. I think that is something that we're just barely starting to see, but will be very interesting to see if we can have systems that can accompany those types of requests in the near future. Erin Pañgilinan: Something really basic I mentioned earlier was your headset of choice is maybe informed by your "ethical moral values" of, I blame X about privacy, so I'm not going to use Meta. That's something I hear a lot. Or it's the same thing for Google. It's really tough because most of the companies that are developing these things do have legitimate privacy concerns with AI. Something really basic that they are doing right, which I think is great. I know if it's a Scarlett Johansson, but I actually had my mom pick, I was like, which ChatGPT voice do you want? It's like customize your version of Siri. I thought, that's a cool user choice. We didn't have that before. Being able to customize to the user based on a set of preferences, it's like, I didn't have it before that my avatar by default wasn't a man. If you think about cars, my brother's a big AZN racer, so we think about customizing, modifying the car constantly. Since the era of the '90s, it's a big thing. For Asian people, this is like the rice rocket movement. How would I customize my computer? Like CarPlay, take out the screen, put in your own screen, modify the UI. This is my custom window, and listen, now that's going to match the color of my car. Think about, what if you could customize the headset so that it would be much more accessible? Here's one thing when I think about more than just ergonomics. I love the Apple Vision Pro. It isn't great for accessibility with people with long hair. It's terrible. No one's gotten makeup right. Jazmin and I actually talk about this a lot, like, what eyeliner can you wear? Something really basic. People don't think about these things. Definitely not because there weren't that many women on these teams. If you think about even the car, how do we design a seatbelt? That was meant in terms of safety primarily for cis straight white men that were over 6 feet tall. I'm 4'10". When we think about accessibility, it's not just like, what is my programming language of choice as a developer? What is my headset choice? I was really excited about Apple. I'm like, you can customize the different type of colors of your computer. This is in the late '90s. There's so much more choice that we have now. There's still a lot of things that we don't have choice in. Part of the reason I'm so excited for Meta, and they haven't done this yet, they haven't open sourced their SDKs and APIs for anything with AR glasses. Many people are trying to hack them. It kind of works, and it kind of doesn't. I did talk with the director of product at Llama because they had shown some videos at Meta Connect about how they're using Llama 3, their latest model, with VR. Is it very accessible when you're talking about multi-modal models, but you're not open sourcing really basic stuff for people who are not doing model development to just basic software engineers? I think part of that problem is just because there's so much work to do within the ecosystem first before you open source something to that level of standard. Optionality and picking the different types of models, even the size of it, so that it's more affordable. It's the same thing for headsets. If I could have a cheaper option than an Apple Vision Pro where most of my community cannot afford a $3,500 headset, can they just get something as cheap as a Meta Quest S? That's probably like a $500 price point, would open up the doors for not only more consumers to enter but also designers and developers from the independent developer and third-party community that doesn't work at a big AAA game company or any of the other headset manufacturing companies. Colby Morgan: I think about adapting users and features and experiences for like specific users. Obviously, there's a lot of different things that you could do and handle. One of the powerful things I really like to rely on as much as possible is just finding tools and systems that can really just adapt to users. Trying to find those broad tools and systems that have a level of dynamic adaption to a player to more seamlessly meet some of their needs, to open up the experience. I want to just create more of a seamless experience that takes more of that friction out of there. Again, I think there's identifying some of those tools and systems that you get a lot of value out of for a lot of different users. One, how you identify those. Then, how you can make those as dynamic as possible. Dylan Fox: The more you can embrace users creating their own adjustments in terms of things like mods, things like 3D printing, custom controllers, or custom headbands, there's a lot of things you can do as a developer to embrace that and support that. Doyle: What about balancing simplicity and feature depth in the user interfaces, especially in the more immersive environments like VR and AR? Colby Morgan: Yes, especially XR, it's definitely a balancing act because it's really easy to go ham. As an XR developer, it's really exciting to make things. It's really exciting to add a bunch of features and effects and different things. I think just as good product design, I always really try to think of how do you focus your product? How do you focus your designs, and really think about your user's focus? What do you really want them to see? What do you want them to look at? What are you going to focus on? I think it's the balance back and forth of, how do you keep a real focused experience for the user, but how do you add more engaging features for users that have been using a product for longer? I think that's the balance of keeping it simple early on for a user, but then just having a clear path for a user to get more exposed to that depth and complexity. Also, any XR application lets users have the choice of, they want to keep the simple core experience. They don't necessarily want to try to get too deep with the features or anything like that. They have that opportunity to participate at the level in the experience they feel comfortable with. Dylan Fox: Some examples to look at are like Google Tilt Brush. You can start off in the simple mode, there's only a few tools on each of your little tool palettes. Then, when you're ready, open up the complex mode and get a bunch more controls, a bunch more customization. Thinking about things like that, thinking about when it comes to design for neurodiverse folks, having the option to turn off distractions, to really bring things down to the barest elements. You'll see that as well with some low vision support, things like, again, The Last of Us will have high contrast mode where it strips it down such that the player is in blue, the enemy is in red, new items are in yellow, and everything else is in gray. You get this extremely different aesthetic style. It becomes very minimalist. Then it makes it so that even if you're heavily visually impaired, you can still get that core sense of what's happening. I think thinking of ways that you can do that, of letting people scale their experience up and down is really good design philosophy. Erin Pañgilinan: Something I started off with when I was transitioning from frontend and mobile, thought about data science, this is probably like 10 years ago, but I was reading a book on microinteractions. I actually like to borrow a lot from even just really basic web devs. I was at WWDC's equivalent of ALT Conf. A bunch of the mobile iOS developer community always has a side conference that watches WWDC every year, which is Apple's developer conference. My friend Gary was actually trying to create this application where you're doing a lot of R&D in a lab, so you're looking at chemistry, beakers, and how you would actually do a bunch of different stuff. It was really cool. I said, but I can't tell what you're paying attention to, so reference the paper, 'Attention is All You Need', what do you focus on? I suggested to him, I was like, I think you need to use something equivalent to CSS and hover, really basic stuff, not a button, but on the actual objects themselves. Lo and behold, that day, Apple announced like, we now have hover effects. I was like, here, this is what you should use. Really basic stuff like that. I think WWDC has some basic standards, like WebXR, it takes a while, and it hasn't completely transferred into native yet just because it's so early in its development process. There's a lot of different microinteractions and paradigms that have been established already and tried and true, between responsive web and mobile development that do transfer over. Then, there are some principles that don't transfer. While I love Apple Vision Pro, a lot of it's very flat design, it actually doesn't optimize all the 3D space. Not everything should be a 2D visualization of the stock market, and, it's in VR, so I'm going to play it in Google Cardboard. This was an experience I tried way back in the day, it doesn't work very well. It was like, and now I can ride through the stock market like a rollercoaster. I'm like, this is horrible. I was really excited when I did a different conference, this was at Bloomberg Tech conference, and there was a demo for stock trading apps and database. I was super excited, it looked exactly the same as what you would have on a mobile app. I was like, this defeats the whole purpose of having it in Apple Vision Pro. There are some applications that can be transferred over, but, again, the chapter in my book is on data and machine learning, visualization and design and development, and it's about 3D in context of the environment, of how you would use that. We also have to think about, what can we borrow from tried-and-true principles of design and development from the web and mobile? Then, what makes it unique that it's in XR, or even adapting some things, not everything, with AI as well, that makes it much more inclusive, accessible, and something that users actually want. Participant 1: When we talk about in the planning phase, how much weightage should we give for introducing accessibility into our user experience? Do you think it's fair to say that the MVP, maybe that shouldn't be part of the MVP, or is it like, let's cater to the majority of the audience first. Then, as a second phase, we should be looking at the accessibility part, or it should be a discussion since day one? How do we balance out the fact that the majority of your audience, in a way, would be linked to the majority of the revenue for the product? How do we justify that accessibility should be part of the MVP, without that direct correlation to the revenue associated with that? Doyle: The question is, do you try to push for meeting accessibility requirements and standards in your MVP, or should that be a follow-up? If it should be part of the MVP, how do you push for prioritizing and arguing for the importance of baking accessibility in to that first version versus waiting later? Erin Pañgilinan: It really depends on your audience, it's very relative. I'm trying to create a productivity app, this is like a selfish dream, for myself, and so I conducted maybe 30 user research interviews since the end of last year. They were primarily women who were neurodivergent with ADHD, that were product managers, designers, and developers, that worked on open source, AR, VR, AI, and crypto, so very similar to me. I'm designing, essentially, for myself. That's a very specific audience, and even within that audience, there's a level of richness that I didn't expect. I was like, so some of you use paper planners, some people use mobile apps for planning, some people don't use anything at all, and they just look at their Google Calendar, and maybe they would love all of it if it worked in their Apple Vision Pro, or they'll only use it and pay for something if it also works in Android and on Linux, like every platform. It's really hard to satisfy people. Even in a target market of something that I thought was really small and specific, it comes down to user segmentation and that feature, and then, who is willing to pay for it? Take this quote from YC, Y Combinator, (make something people want) and we'll pay for it. While I like to think, yes, accessibility, design, inclusive design, and everything should be able to target this type of users or this population first. I really have to be honest with you, some people don't have the budget for that and won't prioritize it because it isn't a part of the bottom line. What it comes down to is like, what set of initial users for that problem are you solving? Then, within that set of users, what are the top three? Really narrow it down. Who are willing to pay for this price for that set of features that should be the real core of your product that is a part of the bottom line? Identifying that, what I realized was like, this is going to take some time. I thought I was trying to be even more narrow and specific, and even then, it's really hard and difficult. Again, it's all relative. If you are a B2B SaaS enterprise app that wants to do telepresence, this is a case for like Cisco or for a client I had in education, like we want hundreds of students to be in XR. We want them to also be able to design fashion and play fitness games and be safer. Two totally different use cases. I'm like, some of that is Meta Quest suite and some of that is Apple Vision Pro. Whatever you think you can prioritize, even just three things, it might be too much. You got to really chunk it down and get really specific, and even then, it still might be too much. Just get very granular to what that MVP is and who will pay for it so that you continue development. Unless you have endless amounts of money you can like self-fund. Like a lot of my friends in crypto who retired, they can just play computer all day and gameplay tests on all the things. Most people in reality can't do that. I would just get super specific and think about the context of who your customers are or who your investors are. I'm like, what is it that they want and what is it that you want? Were you willing to meet people in between for your users? Dylan Fox: These things are generally worth trying to make part of your MVP, and here's why. It's because something like a fully-fledged screen reader system or scalable UI or captions, if it's not 100% perfect right off the bat, that's fine. We all know MVPs can be very rough around the edges sometimes. The trap that I see people falling into over and again is they brainstorm a big list of features, they pick some as MVP, and then they build out something as fast as they possibly can that meets all of those MVP features. That decides the course of development. There's a lot of decisions that are made when it comes to developing during that MVP phase that become set in stone and very hard to change after the fact. If scalable UI is part of your MVP, then you will be building towards that from the start. You'll be making those choices for your development infrastructure that take that into account. If it's slated for your 1.1, what might happen is you develop to get something out the door and then you realize, actually, if we wanted this, we would have needed to develop the core engine and core aspects differently. Which means now it's much more work to do, so maybe it gets shifted from 1.1 to 1.2, and you just start accruing technical debt that if you ever then want to get some of these features in, you'll need to have a big effort. Because, again, a lot of these accessibility features come down to modularity. That is the type of thing that you really want to build in at the start. Do you need to have everything ready to go? Not necessarily. Think about localization. Yes, obviously, if our main user base is in English, then we're just going to focus on English for v1. If you're thinking about localization as part of phase one, then I guarantee you when it comes time to record all your lines in Spanish, in Chinese, in whatever else, it's going to be like a few lines of code to change all those out, instead of, "Our text is hard baked into the game. We can't change it at all. This is going to be a mess". For that reason, I would say, yes, at least some of these accessibility features should be in the MVP. Colby Morgan: Echoing both those points, and I think just to add, especially for Mighty Coconut, I think for us, in that early planning phase, it's important that we have that accessibility mindset of just how we're identifying the friction point, as I think the friction points or the potential friction points, are the really big piece for us. Just knowing what those friction points are, you can better tackle those down the road if you can plan for those of knowing what's coming or anything like that. Erin Pañgilinan: I was developing a productivity app with AI, and I literally was like, this is so fun. Then, I realized this is really broad. You do anything in AI, you think about, the first thing, if you've done any workshop with AWS, this is the amount of money I have for compute and spend. Early in the planning process, through user research, before I even build anything, I'm just trying to extrapolate that list of features and narrowing it down to the smallest possible thing. Because even if you think like, I can make this part of the prototype, it's still a lot of work, so before you spend any money, I would do a good amount of user testing before you build. Then when you actually spend, you'll realize whether or not it was a waste of money or not. Participant 1: Actually, one point that stands out, you mentioned, it collects as a technical debt. I think that's part of that culture. Because this whole accessibility and inclusion bit, I come from the financial industry, it's just in the start. My engineers have raised a lot of technical debt, but accessibility is not something that has anybody raise their hand that we should have this. We now have it as an organizational principle that it should be there, but, as an engineer, nobody has raised that. Maybe that's like, start from that culture, saying that, we need to start looking at this thing. Even if it's not part of the MVP, maybe if it comes up, if people are raising that this is a technical debt, then maybe towards the course of action, it might get an action done. Erin Pañgilinan: You do have a designer in the room at all when you're doing this? Participant 1: Yes. Erin Pañgilinan: I just think about Apple, it's like, when a designer comes in the room, somebody would say, they're like God, I'm like, it helps. Participant 1: Yes, that helps. Again, the designer is also, as you said, like a phone, where this phone has been two centuries old, to understand that, where we come from. It's like, that kind of thought process takes a bit of time to come, but it does come in. You mentioned we attended Bloomberg conference, so there should be a difference between the Bloomberg version versus any of the Meta conferences, and things like that. That mentality is still growing. I think that was a good test, that if engineers start thinking that way, that this is a technical debt, then, at some point in time, it's going to have to be introduced. Erin Pañgilinan: Technical debt and financial debt, like my cost of computing, we used to say, this is saving developers this amount of time and spend, and to talk really less on productivity, and developer experience, DevEx. It's like, if I can identify the amount of time and money saved for an engineering team because we included design first, and it affects the amount of compute that we're going to spend and the amount of time we're going to spend engineering this feature or product line, then I think it's easier to make that call. Harder to do for something like a newer problem, because you mentioned MVP, but if it's for an existing legacy system, that's how I would quantify it, to be able to get a little bit more buy-in, to include it as more first principles earlier on. Doyle: If you had to pick one piece of advice, what would you tell newcomers to the field who want to make inclusiveness a core focus? Colby Morgan: I think I would tell newcomers to the space, one, really look at your user base, look who your target audience is. Find ways to connect more with them directly. Just identify the needs of that audience. Dylan Fox: If you're looking for problems to solve that actually mean something, look to disabled communities, because there's a lot of places in the more privileged parts of the world where we've started to invent some bullshit problems. There's also a lot of people out there who have real problems that, with just a little bit of design thinking and actually listening to the people with those problems, and off-the-shelf XR AI technology, I think there's a ton of stuff that could be made that just hasn't been yet. There's a ton of low-hanging fruit and unsolved problems that really affect people's day-to-day lives. Please do think about that. We have a lot of resources at XR Access that talk about how to design and develop accessibly, so check those out. Try to make sure that what you're doing is really going to be making a difference in people's lives and not just something shiny and novel because the technology is there for it. Erin Pañgilinan: Be open. Try everything, at least once. Expect the unexpected. There are so many new developments. Some of my friends, they clairvoyantly predicted this was going to happen in XR, and I was like, no. Some of that was Michael Abrash, and we always knew glasses were going to come out and things of that nature. Look to history, so what you're thinking is going to come in the future. Also, there are things that are popping up now that I did not expect, so in any new emerging technology, that's going to happen, be really open-minded. When I say try everything, that's because I literally have probably tried every headset and experience I could get my hands on, because you'll find a bunch of stuff that works and a bunch of stuff that doesn't. I don't just say that for developers and designers, I say that for consumers because that's a really good way to, one, do user research. Then, basically testing of like, yes, that did not work at all, we're not going to spend any more engineering hours, or time, or money on this because we assumed this would work functionally, and it actually didn't. We expected something that works in principle, is like, the PowerPoint slides or the video, should work. It did not work, even though I gameplay tested it about 10 times over and over now. Yes, be open, try everything, and expect the unexpected.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Costco Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings

Time Published: 2025-09-25T14:10:58Z

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) will release earnings results for the fourth quarter, after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 25. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $5.81 per share, up from $5.29 per share in the year-ago period. COST projects quarterly revenue of $86.06 billion, compared to $79.7 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Costco has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in five of the last 10 quarters overall. With the recent buzz around Costco, some investors may also be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Currently, Costco offers an annual dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of $1.30 per share ($5.20 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,090,842 or around 1,154 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $218,357 or around 231 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($5.20 in this case). So, $6,000 / $5.20 = 1,154 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $5.20 = 231 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. COST Price Action: Shares of Costco rose 0.2% to close at $945.27 on Wednesday.

Title: Why Is AXON Stock Falling?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise’s stock dropped 10% on September 24th following the announcement of its acquisition of Prepared, an AI-powered 911 communication company. This decline was likely fueled by investor concerns regarding the acquisition's price and its potential impact on Axon's increasing expenses. Although Axon has demonstrated strong revenue growth, its operating margin has recently been on a downward trend. In light of this recent stock performance, we will now analyze how Axon compares to its peers in the industrial sector in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins. For context, Axon Enterprise offers conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement agencies worldwide to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence. Why is this important? AXON recently dropped 10.2% in a single day - comparing it to its peers contextualizes stock performance, valuation, and financials - indicating if it is genuinely outperforming, lagging, and most importantly - will this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AXON Stock to determine if Axon Enterprise is indeed a falling knife. Sharp declines frequently present rebound opportunities - observe how the stock has retreated and rebounded previously through AXON Dip Buyer Analysis. While comparing peers is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside exposure. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are lower after two straight days of declines for major indexes as investors await key economic data; Costco Wholesale (COST) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell; Intel (INTC) shares are rising on a report it is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL); and Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off workers and closing stores as it continues to restructure. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing a lower open for major indexes after two days of declines as investors prepare for the release of key economic data reports to finish off the week. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.2%. Gold futures edged higher to $3,785 an ounce to stay near record highs, while bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $111,500, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer borrowing costs, edged higher to 4.16%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today, with some analysts expecting volatility in the stock. The update comes after some investors were shaken in the spring by signs that sales growth had decelerated. The company has already reported that fourth-quarter sales rose 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect the retailer to report that profits grew to $2.6 million in the fourth-quarter, up from $2.4 million a year ago. Costco shares, which have gained 3% since the start of the year, were slightly higher in premarket trading. Data on economic growth, jobless claims and housing sales are in focus this morning ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report that's set to be released Friday. The jobless claims numbers, which are expected to show a slight increase, are being closely watched by investors after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week amid signs that the labor market is weakening. Revisions to second-quarter gross domestic product are expected to show that growth held steady at 3.3%, while existing home sales are estimated to have declined slightly. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak today, ahead of the release tomorrow morning of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Shares of Intel (INTC) continued gaining ground this morning following a report the chipmaker is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). Intel shares rose more than 6% on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported on talks between the companies, which also centered on other ways that Apple could help the beleaguered chipmaker. The report comes after Nvidia (NVDA) last week agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal that will see the two companies co-develop chips for data centers and PCs. Intel shares were up nearly 2% in recent premarket trading. The stock has gained more than 50% year-to-date, but remain well off its historical highs. Apple shares were little changed ahead of the bell. Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off around 900 employees in its corporate offices and closing some stores as CEO Brian Niccol continues to implement his “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. Niccol said in an update Thursday that the total number of stores was expected to decline by about 1% in 2025 after the closures. He said that laid-off employees in corporate offices would receive severance packages, while employees at closed stores could also receive severance if they are not transferred to other nearby stores. The moves come as analysts have praised the coffee chain’s efforts to revive sales amid sluggish customer traffic. Starbucks shares were flat in premarket trading.

Title: Why Shopify Stock Could Drop 50% Despite Strong Growth?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) allows businesses to build and operate online stores. Their clients include Skullcandy, Daily Harvest, and Carrier. The stock has soared approximately 85% over the previous year, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 16% rise, and is currently trading at $149, just short of its September 2025 high of $157.12. While the growth is robust and recent results are encouraging, Shopify’s track record of volatility serves as a reminder to investors that there is a tangible downside risk. Also see Buy or Fear Shopify Stock? The company has aggressively expanded into Europe, where gross merchandise volume (GMV) has increased sharply, and is making substantial investments in AI and technology to enhance search capabilities for merchants. These efforts bolster long-term growth potential, but the stock is currently trading at very high multiples, suggesting that the market might already be factoring in flawless performance. Historical fluctuations indicate that Shopify can experience significant declines if growth or profit margins fall short — in a downside scenario, shares could realistically drop by as much as 50% from current levels. We analyze three essential factors that could lead to downside: revenues, margins, and valuation. Find out more in What’s Behind IONQ Stock’s Winning Streak? That being said, investing in a single company involves significant risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has posted returns exceeding 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Shopify’s revenue has increased at an average of 26% over the past three years, rising from $7.8 billion to $10 billion in the last year. The most recent quarter saw a 31% year-over-year rise in revenue. However, several data points indicate potential downside risk: Shopify is presently reporting an operating margin of 15.3% and a net margin of 23.4%, generating nearly $1.8 billion in operating cash flow during the past year. While these figures are robust for a high-growth platform, several factors could impose pressure on profitability and amplify downside risk: Shopify’s present valuation heightens the downside risk. The stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 19.5, a price-to-earnings ratio of 83.1, and a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 107.3, significantly above S&P 500 averages. These multiples suggest that the market is anticipating continued robust growth in revenue and margins. By factoring in revenue deceleration, margin pressures, and multiple contractions, Shopify shares could realistically endure a decline of up to 50% from current levels in a situation where growth slows, margins compress, and sentiment changes. Shopify is a strong company with significant growth, global reach, AI-driven innovation, and solid profitability, but the timing is uncertain, and downside risk persists if sales slow, margins compress, or competitors gain market share. You may want to look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Financial Sector Was Tottering Even Before Trump

Time Published: 2025-09-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I’ve written a good bit about the economic wreckage wrought by President Donald Trump’s economic policies—tariffs, manipulation of the Federal Reserve, a deficit-doubling tax cut for the rich—and how these might tank the economy. Today let’s consider how, even if Trump weren’t president, the finance sector could tank the economy all by its lonesome through shadow banking, most especially in the private equity industry. The term “shadow banking” was coined in 2007 by a money manager named Paul McCulley to describe financial institutions that mimic what commercial banks do—money markets, mortgage companies, investment banks, hedge funds, and, yes, private equity—but are not regulated like banks. It’s called shadow banking because these firms lack banks’ transparency. Shadow banks furnish a higher return than banks typically do, but their investments are much riskier and lack government protections for investors. Much of the mischief in the 2008 financial crisis was caused by shadow banks, whose combined assets were as large or perhaps larger than those of commercial banks. Five years later, shadow banks’ holdings represented nearly 80 percent of global gross domestic product. Nobody disputes this makes the global financial system less secure. Even those parts of the financial system that would seem to have nothing to do with you and me can disrupt our lives. I’d never even heard of “family offices” until I read Chuck Collins’s excellent 2021 book, The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Pay Millions to Hide Trillions. (Clearly, I don’t hang with the right crowd.) Family offices are organizations set up by very rich people to preserve their wealth over multiple generations; they’re more or less Thomas Jefferson’s worst nightmare. Although family offices have been around a long time—the Cabots and the Lowells had them in the nineteenth century—more than half of those now in existence, per Collins, were created in this still-young century. Jeff Bezos’s dad just expanded his. Sometimes family offices combine into multifamily offices, or family funds. Vacationing in Nassau last year, I drove past what looked like a Walmart or Costco; on closer inspection, it was a big-box family fund. (It won’t surprise you to learn that family funds flourish in tax havens like the Bahamas.) Family offices and family funds are perhaps the most blatant engines of what Thomas Piketty calls “patrimonial capitalism.” That makes it tempting to greet the prospect that they might collapse with a hearty, “Good riddance!” And yes, if they declined in some gradual, stately manner like the Magnificent Ambersons, that’s what I’d say too. The trouble is that they’re at least equally likely to decline abruptly, taking the rest of us down with them. As The Economist observed in 2018, “Family offices could endanger the stability of the financial system. Combining very rich people, opacity, and markets can be very expensive.” When the family fund Archegos went bust in 2021, it cost Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley more than $10 billion, with ripple effects in the stock market of $33 billion. If your retirement fund held stock in CBS or Discovery then it was hard cheese for you. The corner of shadow banking that appears shakiest today is private equity, which is what we called leveraged buyouts before the convicted junk-bond king Michael Milken gave them a bad name in the late 1980s. Private equity firms use debt to buy existing firms; manage them to be more profitable, typically through layoffs; then take them public. Defenders of the practice used to say this made the target companies more efficient. But today almost everybody who doesn’t work in private equity hates private equity for loading up companies with insurmountable debt and raking in so much money on fees that private equity firms don’t have to care all that much whether this or that company survives. Another common criticism is that private equity puts the squeeze on certain enterprises—hospitals, retirement homes, even hospice providers—that were never intended to be profit-maximizers, weakening the quality of the vital social services they provide. Can’t afford to buy a house? In his latest book, Burned by Billionaires: How Concentrated Wealth and Power Are Ruining Our Lives and Planet, Collins demonstrates various ways in which private equity drives up housing costs. One Ohio firm invests in short-term and vacation rentals—Airbnb, Vrbo, etc.—to the tune of $1.5 billion, with capital from the Blackstone Group and other 800-pound gorillas in private equity. Lately I’ve had trouble reconciling two story lines in the financial press about private equity. One story line is that private equity is taking over the world. The other is that private equity is on the verge of extinction. Bethany McLean, the superb financial reporter who last week started a column in The Washington Post, squared the circle in her inaugural essay by explaining that private equity is swallowing up everything in sight precisely because it’s in financial trouble. McLean’s piece was about President Donald Trump’s executive order last month directing the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to ease fiduciary requirements to encourage people to invest their 401(k)s in private equity and other “alternative assets,” by which Trump meant shadow banks. As it happens, Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, gave $37 million to Republican and conservative groups in the last election cycle. I’m sure that’s just a coincidence. Trying to herd grandma into private equity is insane. The rationale for private equity going unregulated is that the customers are either rich people or investors for giant pension and other funds who are savvy enough to take risks you and I shouldn’t, and rich enough that, should the risk go sour, no great harm is done. That’s the precise opposite circumstance from defined-contribution pensions, which until now have been regulated to the hilt to protect grandma from getting swindled. McLean doesn’t put it as bluntly as I do here, but her bottom line is that while you don’t particularly need private equity, “it is absolutely clear that private equity needs you—or rather, the trillions of dollars Americans have in our retirement accounts. Without our money, the industry is slamming into a brick wall of its own making.” I phoned McLean to ask her whether that brick wall is something that you and I need to worry about. Might private equity take us down with it? Absolutely, she replied. “Private equity has become too big to fail,” she said, “which raises a whole question of whether it should be private at all.” The solution, McLean said, is to regulate private equity as we do commercial banks and public corporations, with comparable transparency and legal limits on what it can do with our money. Private equity started to falter around the time Lina Khan became chair of the Federal Trade Commission, because any limit on mergers is a limit on how private equity firms reassemble the companies they acquire. Rising interest rates dealt another blow. Mostly, though, private equity was a victim of its own success. It ran out of things to buy and bid up the price of whatever was left. Default rates for private equity–backed companies, McLean pointed out, hit 17 percent during the previous three years, more than double the rate for companies not backed by private equity. By 2022, nearly half of all the supposedly slimmed-down and tuned-up companies exiting private equity firms were sold to other private equity firms, prompting one investor to tell The Financial Times, “This is the start of, potentially, I’m saying ‘potentially,’ a pyramid scheme.” In January, the FT columnist John Plender, writing about systemic risks in private equity, concluded: “No prizes for guessing where the next financial crisis will emerge from.” Of course, Trump doesn’t help matters by urging us all to throw our money into private equity and other risky shadow banks. But barring strict regulation of this sector to a degree that seems politically impossible at the moment, these outlaw financial institutions are fully capable of crashing the economy on their own.

Booking is one of my favorite companies in the world: they are a textbook Aggregator. And, in a fascinating twist, they are also among the best at managing Google, the biggest Aggregator of them all. In this interview we discuss both dynamics, starting from Priceline’s acquisition of Booking, the evolution of their business model, and where the company is going in the future. Along the way we discuss network effects and just how powerful they are, the challenges of building customer loyalty and being a destination site, and how AI might finally fulfill the longstanding dream of recreating the travel agent experience.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Glenn Faujelle, welcome to Stratechery. Glenn Fogel: (laughing) Fogel is the name but I will accept. I asked you and you said you wish you had what the French call you. GF: My wife would change the name if it was Faujelle, instead she doesn’t. She goes by her maiden name. Well, it’s appropriate because given Booking’s European roots, but we can get to all that in a moment. I’m very excited to talk to you, I love Booking, I feel like it’s a company I should have written about more. There’s just never been that right moment to really nail it, but you mentioned that you’re a reader, it fits so well with so many things that I’ve written about, all which I want to get to in this interview. But before we get to Booking and get to why I’m interested in it, I do want to start with you and your background, where you grew up, what you thought you would be, and if it would be someone who wants to make his name French because he’s such a big deal on the European continent. GF: Yeah, so I’ll be brief. I grew up outside New York City in the suburbs, very nice suburbia growing up. I have parents who were very into education, they didn’t have college degrees, but they believed the importance of going to school, so I worked very hard. I was 17, a junior in the spring and I was looking forward to in the fall applying to colleges and I had unfortunately a very serious stroke, paralyzed me on my right side, wiped out all my language capabilities, and spent some time coming back up and ended up going to college. How long did that take to recover from? GF: Well, actually because it was the spring of my junior year, I was able to go to college in a year from the following fall so it was a year and some months, I did go. But I worked extremely hard there, I got a degree in finance at what was the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School as an undergraduate, graduated actually early to save some money for my folks. Started working but not in finance, I was working in IT, I was at Morgan Stanley in what was then called MIS, it was their IT shop and that in 1984, but we still had punch card machines. We didn’t use them, but they were there. My first job was putting tapes on drives. Memory used to be in tapes — many of your listeners do not know anything I’m talking about — turned out, ended up doing coding, wasn’t great at it, said I should do something else. It’s the ’80s, M&A was booming, I said, “Well, I’d like to go over to the other side at Morgan Stanley where all those merger and acquisition bankers were making good money”. Can’t just jump from being an IT guy even though I had the finance degree, so I went and got a degree at Harvard Law School. Came out, no intention of being a lawyer, started right at an investment bank called Kidder, Peabody & Co. Rode it into the ground, went eventually went to nothing, got sold to Paine Webber, at which point they let go most of the bankers. So I lost my job, and while was not fun, it did give me the experience of having been let go. Right. GF: So I have that credential. Something you had to be the other end of many years later. GF: Right. Met a woman and eventually she said, “If this relationship’s going to go on, you should get a job”, so I end up being a trader at Morgan Stanley and I did that for a couple years in the late ’90s and the Internet’s booming and I’m saying, “Wow, that seems a lot more exciting”, and I have a background in IT, I got a background in finance, and there was this job at a company called Priceline.com, which was really the darlings of the Internet bubble, so to speak. Right, one of the most insane IPOs at that time. GF: Exactly. It went public in the spring of 1999, right away over a $30 billion valuation, which back then was real money. I didn’t join until February of 2000, I had gotten the job at the end of ’99 and I said, “Listen, I’ll come over, but I just want to get my bonus for Morgan Stanley, they don’t pay you until February, so I got to stay until February”. They said, “No problem”, so I leave my trading job end of February, one week before the NASDAQ peaks, thereby proving that I should not be a trader, having just top ticked the Internet, gone long Internet. So I did that, and the company’s worth about $15 billion at the time and we went down over towards the end of the year to just a couple hundred million dollars market cap. Stock eventually went down to a dollar a share, had to do a reverse split to get it up. Was it a good thing you got that bonus to sort of carry you through? GF: Yeah, it certainly, certainly was. Turns out your stock grant wasn’t worth very much! GF: But imagine what my wife was saying to me. “Let me get this straight now, you left a great paying job, a real good job at Morgan Stanley to this high-flying company?”, but it worked out okay. So the stock on reverse split, $6 a share, way back then, I’ve been there now 25 years and while we’re not quite up to $6,000 a share yet, it’s not far. So easy math almost 1,000 times in 25 years, so it’s worked out okay. Yeah, you’re still married, so I think that’s the biggest endorsement that it all worked out. You’ve talked in other interviews about that stroke and how it grounded you through difficult times and to your point, Booking’s had a few of them. You go back through the Dot Com crash — well, I guess Priceline I should start out with, we’ll get to the Booking portion in a moment. The Dot Com crash, obviously there was 9/11 shortly thereafter, not great for travel, there’s the Great Recession, COVID-19, I mentioned the layoffs bit before, Google’s SERP changes. Okay, maybe that one doesn’t quite fit with the other one, so we can get to that one another time. GF: No, it does. But how did that shape you? And balance, clearly you wanted to chase the big thing, you want to take some risks. What benefit did that bring to you in your leadership style? GF: Well, you listed a bunch and there were so many other very trying moments, many of which we’d have to fill up the entire discussion to go through all of them. But the one thing that’s consistent among all these things is, and it’s the idea that if you’ve been through a crisis, you’re better prepared to deal with the next one. Having actually been in the arena in fighting the fight helps you understand that when you’re in the next one, stay calm, understand what your options are, how to play it. Minimize where there’s potential losses, try and see what other avenues can you go down, maintain flexibility. So again, it’s one of those things when things seem to go all to hell to say, especially the most recent, that pandemic, and there were a lot of people in panic. I’m like, “Hey, been there before, let’s not panic”. In fact, we’ve been through that whole COVID thing, the SARS-1 issue back in 2003 and we’d actually seen the effect of that before. So it was like, “Been there, no, it’s okay, we’ll be fine”. Yeah, that’s a great perspective. I mean it’s funny because I was in Taiwan, went to Taiwan in 2003, and so I was aware of that at the time, it had sort of died down at that point, but it’s interesting to tie it back to that. You’d seen major disruption, people scared to travel. I did want to ask about Priceline, the initial model of which was, “name-your-own-price“, how insane was that in retrospect or do you still think it was a good idea? GF: Well, so the idea of coming up with an opaque process, meaning opaque, you don’t really know what you’re buying, but you’re willing to do it to save a lot of money. Right away that’s not a bad thing. Now if we look in economics, the idea of consumer surplus or supplier surplus, and you see what you end up where you have people, consumers, who either are getting a benefit — they’d be willing to pay more for something, but the price is not at that level. The idea was trying to match up, capture what the person was willing to sell it for, is very good when you have a product you’re selling with very, very low marginal costs. Yep, and somebody needs to stay at a hotel, or they’re not going to make anything. GF: Or an airline, it much more was the airline. So that airline seat, the marginal cost of that seat is essentially zero. Right. GF: So if the airline can fill that up with something without impacting its regular distribution channels because you don’t want to have any type of price cannibalization, and the way that it came out wasn’t a bad idea at all. The problem really was is there aren’t a lot of verticals that that really worked for, and people, for whatever reason, they just don’t like the idea as much about putting in a bid with whether you get no chance to back out. If you put that bid in and somebody accepts it, you got to pay that amount and you’re on and there’s no refund. That’s really interesting because I would think that a big problem with that is it’s offloading a lot of burden onto the customer. It feels very weighty. “Did I put the right price?”, “What do I do?”, “Should I be too high?”, “Should I be too low?”, or is that part and parcel of the fact you can’t back out, you’re locked in once you commit? Or are those two different threads? GF: Well, I think there are two things, but I think they go to the same point. Right, it’s too much cognitive weight on the customer. GF: It’s tremendous. And the thing is, human beings are odd. It’s interesting, one of the things that bothers people almost as much as overpaying is not overpaying but paying more — even though they’re comfortable paying it — more than what somebody else got. The sense of fairness, it permeates everything. GF: But it does because when somebody says, “What is being rich?”, being rich is having more money than your brother-in-law. It’s all relative, and that’s one of the issues too. So in the end, the idea of bidding, not great, but the idea of having opaque pricing with some type of trade-offs is still used a lot. We still have those types of things and people are willing to do it and let’s say we see it in many different instances where people are willing to take a trade-off in terms of what the quality of what you’re buying to get a better price. So we’re going to get to AI in a moment, but as long as we’re here, would AI have made that work better by reducing the cognitive load? Or maybe another way to ask this is will AI-driven variable pricing work in the future in a way that makes customers feel good? And not feeling like, “They know who I am and so they’re screwing me”? GF: It’s very interesting to think, “How will the world of the future be if everybody has an agent and the agent is able to instantly be always checking for prices?”. And at the same time, the seller also has an agent that’s always looking at what is the current price and how does that work? As markets get very, very transparent, it’s going to be very interesting. Now the topping of all this though will be regulations because it’s also interesting where again, this idea of fairness, and which is an interesting concept, of regulators coming out and saying, “Well, is that fair or not?”, where you could have two parties, the seller and the buyer, both feel it’s fine and they’re happy. But the regulator says, “That’s not a fair market”, and starts putting in rules. So I can’t predict really what’s going to happen, but I agree with you, it’s going to be very interesting how it plays out. So when you bought Booking in 2005, what was your mindset when you bought the company? And the reason I asked, did you just think you were expanding internationally buying another travel site? Both you and Expedia were being very aggressive at that time, or did you realize you were buying an entirely different business model? I’d love for you to explain to me the difference in how Priceline acquired rooms back then and what Booking did and why that ended up being a big deal? GF: Yeah, it’s a shame we don’t have enough time to really go into all the nitty-gritty. Oh, no, I actually think this part is super, super interesting. So spend as much time as you want. GF: Okay, so we have the name-your-own-price product at Priceline, and I come in and I’m corporate development and we want to expand internationally with name-your-own-price. So we’re doing it throughout the world, different ways we create different structures and one structure was we set up this joint venture type operation in Europe, it’s Priceline Europe. Terrible timing, 9/11, and then you have recession and we pull back, etc. so it’s a very, very small operation now in Europe and we let go a lot of the people and I am now actually in charge of that. And I’m saying, “This is the craziest thing in the world”, because the idea of name-your-own-price to get a flight from London to Paris when you can go on Ryanair and EasyJet and pay five pounds, you’re going to save 50%, so it’s £2.50, really? Who’s going to do that? You end up with Frankfurt. You go London, Frankfurt, Paris, nobody’s going to do that. We got to do stuff the old fashion way, in addition, hotels. So we stopped the flight stuff, that’s ridiculous, but the hotel thing is okay. Name-your-own-price for hotels, but still people like to know the price and they like to know what they’re getting exactly. So I’m looking around, who knows how to sell like that around here? And find a little company called Active Hotels in the UK. Meet up with the people, we end up buying that in 2004, $165 million US dollars with an earn out for the founders who I want to stay on because the real value in anything is the people, it’s not like a coal mine where you’ve got coal underground, this is the people, and so we create a structure that gives them the upside if we’re really successful. So that happens in, when did that happen? 2004, in the summer of 2004, we end up in the fall of 2004, I am introduced to the people at Booking.com who are based in Amsterdam. They have almost the exact same model as Active Hotel, they’re disclosing everything just like you normally would by hotels but both Active and Booking have something slightly different than how the really big player, Expedia back then was the big player, and some of the other ones are. The difference is if you went to Expedia, you put your credit card in and you are essentially being charged right there. Merchant model, it’s called. Expedia is acquiring the room and you’re buying it from Expedia. GF: Well no, they’re not actually. Legally, they don’t actually own the room. In fact, what they have is the money in their bank account. Oh, so they get float along the way. GF: Which they are not planning to pay the hotel until after the person actually stays in the hotel and back then it would’ve been like a month afterwards. Really bad for cash flow for the hotels, really good cash flow for Expedia. Active had a different way of doing it called the agency model, which was, we’ll take the credit card, but that’s only to guarantee that you’ll actually show up. We’re not actually taking the money, the money was not run, the credit card was not run. So essentially, when you showed up at the hotel under Active Hotels, you paid the hotel at the desk with your credit card, or cash, or whatever, then Active sent afterwards an invoice to the hotel to pay the commission on it, totally reverse in the way the cash flow works. Booking had the exact same model as Active Hotel. So the issue was the more business you did, the faster you grew, especially with Booking because they had to pay Google up front in that month, but they weren’t going to get paid for months later, the hotel was going to pay him months later. The faster you grew, the worst your negative cash flow can get worse, worse, worse, worse, worse. So that’s one of the reasons we were able to convince them to join our little band. So Booking came into, and we combined Active and Booking to one company, and we threw in Priceline Europe too. But Booking’s a better name, so we kept it as Booking.com, and that’s the story. But here’s the question, though. You’re able to buy them because they have this problematic cash cycle. GF: And we bought them because they were totally European base, pretty much, Active was mostly the UK, so they could share and we put the inventory together, so now they’re both better off. And look, you spend a lot of time talking about network effects, etc, well here where you really have a great benefit by being able to add a lot more of the inventory to show to a particular traveler. That’s one of the big benefits. For sure, we’re definitely going to get to all that, but I’m very curious about this because from my perspective, the agency model is a critical component of what makes Booking what it is, into the behemoth that it has become. I talk about Aggregation Theory, and one of the things is the scalability aspect, all aspects need to be scalable and with this model, you have more from a hotel perspective, more scalability, more ability to come on, and you don’t need these custom integrations or whatever it might be. To me, that seems essential, so you acquiring the agency model seems super important to me, and it’s really striking to hear actually you talk about the real downsides of it, and the reason why it was a struggle for these companies. GF: Well back then that was certainly one of the ways we were able to grow rapidly was because go to a hotel and say, “Listen, just give us your content, just give us your photos, just tell us the prices, we’ll put it on”. We don’t need to make a business deal, yeah. GF: Yeah, and then if somebody shows up, we’re going to send you an invoice, and please pay us. Now part of the problems in that model for a lot of people who tried that in the past, was the hotels didn’t pay. So in the US for example, the actual collection rate for a travel agency was very bad, hotels would just ignore the commission letter, say, “Who cares about them?”, so that was a critical part too was collections, having a system to be able to collect the commissions. That was critical, and one among many different things that was done at the time that really made it different than a lot of other companies that historically had always done the commission-based agency model. What I’m curious about is did you go in thinking, “Okay, Booking has this, we’re going to change it to our model”? And then was there a point where you realized, “No, actually for all the challenges that this model presents, it’s actually better”. Why is it better? Why did that matter? GF: What’s good is having both models, Priceline was always the merchant model starting out. When we went into Asia, and we have the agency model at Booking.com, I was concerned, “Would it still work there?”, so we also looked at another company, very, very small company called Agoda. And Agoda based in Bangkok, they had the merchant model, and we ended up buying Agoda too, and now we keep them separate brands, separate things. Now, both have agency and merchant in different ways at different places, and the consumer gets to chose and there are many reasons people choose one versus the other. But having more choice is really an important benefit when you’re going to a customer. And I’ll go on, it’s now in terms of the way people pay, it’s incredible. So I think we’re over 40 maybe now, different ways a consumer can pay us, and we take the money and send it to the hotel, which is really important. If you are a consumer in Shanghai, and you’re going to show up at a small little hotel in the South of France, and you want to show up at the desk and use your whatever, Alipay or your WeChat Pay, that French hotel’s going to say, “What are you talking about? Please give me euros”, and that’s not it, but we are in-between it. We will take the Alipay or WeChat Pay, and we will then put euros in the bank account of the French hotel. And by the way, it’ll be a lot cheaper for the French hotel than if they had gotten a credit card from the traveler, because the interchange is much higher than us putting money into their bank account. So the answer to your question is payments is really important it’s the reason why we do a tremendous amount of our business is now done in the merchant model, not the agency model. Interesting. GF: There are a lot of benefits to it. So the agency model got all these folks on board, and then over time once you had that relationship built in, you could circle back to the merchant model. That makes a lot of sense. GF: Right. Exactly. Going back to this buildup aspect, another critical piece of Booking from my perspective is that the hotel market in Europe, particularly 20 years ago, was far more fragmented. You just have a lot more independent hotels as opposed to the US being more chains and things along those lines. This seems to me to cut in multiple dimensions. First to the agency model point, that scalability bit and it being super easy to get linked up seems really important. And second, this really just landed you right in the sweet spot of an aggregator, where consumers see way more hotels than they would anywhere else. And from a hotel, you suddenly are seen by way more customers than anywhere else. This seems obvious now, I guess I’m stating things that seem clear about network effects, but did you realize this when you bought Booking — I’m just really curious, because the Booking acquisition was such a home run. One of the things you did as CEO was change the name, “Okay, we’ve held on to Priceline for too long, we are Booking”, again, it’s not a home run, it’s a grand slam. I’m just curious how much of this did you learn along the way versus, “Oh, this is how it’s going to happen”? GF: No, these are all well understood concepts long before we started buying hotel agencies, like Booking.com. I had studied network theory long before that and I mean the basis of the Internet, or even going either further back, and there’s the famous when you’re in school you learn about, “Well, one telephone has a value of nothing”. Metcalfe’s law, yeah. GF: Of course it is. Right, exactly. You start getting into, “Well what is the value of a network?”, Ii it the square of the number of nodes, or how do you want to figure out the math of what is? But sure, of course that was all well understood and recognized why it would be such a valuable, valuable thing to have. But everybody knew that, and didn’t matter whether we were agency or merchant, everyone has built a network as quickly as possible, as fast as possible. What’s interesting, of course, is why did some of the networks that were out front, they got really good, but then they die out where others continue? We don’t have time to go into that, and theories of why did MySpace die but Facebook lived? Well let’s do it in travel. Why did Booking, why did you pass Expedia? Why did you become the top dog? GF: There are a lot of reasons that go into a question, and here we go into the idea of coming up with the narrative fallacy, which it’s a famous saying. Where we’re going to create a story about why the world is the way it is today, it’s not provable. You’re tapping into what I keep trying to pry around the edges of, because I know the story you tell. There’s a story I look backwards and see, and this is all straightforward, and I’m just so curious about how you actually navigated this story way back then, when it’s, again, it’s really easy to look backwards and everything seems so obvious. GF: Of course, that’s the issue of the narrative fallacy. And I can tell my story, and you have your story, many people have many stories about it, but there’s no way to actually prove out what is true and what is not true. I do know that I have a belief of certain things that are very critical. I also know, and this is really important for anybody who’s in a business with anything in life really, is that so much of the ultimate results are going to be determined by things you have zero control over. I can’t control what our competitors do, I can’t control what governments do in terms of economics, I can’t control issues like natural disasters, and so many things are going to impact your business. In our business, my Lord, things hit us all the time, and the only thing we can do is control ourselves. So try and improve the products, improve the services, so that both sides of our marketplace, our travelers and our partners, both see value in participating at our business, at their free will and that’s very important for us is that look, no hotel in the world has to work with us, they do it because we give them value to do it. And by the way, some hotels don’t. I even stay at hotels that are not on our network, because they don’t want to be on our network, but I want to stay in that hotel. There’s a place in Lake George in upstate New York— That’s a lot of throat-clearing, though. So what is your narrative that you’re going to give my audience? What is the key thing why you surpassed everyone? GF: I won’t do that, and here’s why, because I give it, and then it gives it more weight, and more credence, and more belief that was the truth. There is no truth. The only thing I can say is part of the reason is we worked damn hard, part is we had really smart driven people who wanted to succeed. Part of it is they came up with ways to provide more service, more value to both sides than other players did and being a friendlier partner, being better customer service, really focusing on it, customer centricity, those things were really, really important, but that’s kind of like table stakes for a lot of companies do that. All right, fair enough. I’ll let you off the hook. Tell me about your relationship with Google. I don’t know if it’s still the case, I know for a long time you were the biggest Google ad spender and I believe that really happened around sort of the tail ends of the 2000s, early 2010s, when that really ramped up. Was that driven by Google’s change of the SERP and moving away from ten blue links into their own travel product, and you realized, “Hey, game’s changed, we have to approach this differently”? What was the process there, and how has that evolved? GF: Interesting, so when we were about to buy Booking.com, and we already owned Active Hotels, Active Hotels was very into SEO, all free search, very into that and they also had a lot of affiliates that were really bot farms, they were all farms, and we got a lot of business from them. Booking, on the other hand, and this is another reason we wanted to combine them both, is Booking was really into SEM [Search Engine Marketing], they were paying, and they really became really one of the first players that I’m aware of that did really big A/B testing, really interesting science going into that stuff. Right before we buy Booking, Google does a giant change in the algo, and we drop so much business on all the free clicks, it was like, “Wow, what’s happened?”. That’s when we really tilted more, “Okay, so we just have to keep paying more and more into Google”, and optimizing it so we actually have a good ROI, which we did, and continued to work on that. That was before 2010, that was 2005, 2006, 2007. Then of course, you have the financial crisis, etc., but we still power through that. And that’s it, now I have no idea who the biggest spenders are with Google now, Google does not disclose, we do spend a heck of a lot of money with them, it’s a very good relationship, we’re good partners. We have a similar goal, and that is to get customers to get what they want as soon as they can. I think that your approach to Google, for me, is a big part of the narrative story, and in two respects. Number one, there are other people in this space who got very large on SEO that basically their response to Google’s changes was to whine and whine incessantly for years and years and years and I feel there’s a very sort of pragmatic approach from Booking for years that, to your point, you can’t control what happens around you. You sort of play the hand that you’re dealt, and you dealt that by we’re going to pay. What I’m curious about is, and this is sort of part two, is there an aspect where you’re dealing with Google, the ultimate aggregator, gave you more sympathy for the hotels, and dealing with you and knowing how to deal with them since you’re sort of sitting on top of them in that role? Or was there the opposite where just shit flows downhill sort of as it might be? I’m just curious, you’re in a unique position of clearly being an aggregator, one of the most textbook aggregators ever, and yet also you have to be aggregated by Google, and sort of navigate that, and figure it out. GF: I do talk about this sometimes, it comes up. So we’ll have a hotel here, and let’s say we’re charting a 15% commission, and they’re not thrilled with having to pay 15% to us. Of course, we have to pay a big amount to Google to get the traffic to us, right? And so, you’re right, there is this relationship, and the big overall point is nobody likes to pay for marketing or distribution. Everybody would like all their business to come to them free, direct, loyal, again, and again, and again. People being people, that’s not exactly how the world works, so you do have to pay. Then the next thing is you want to at least make sure that it’s a fair relationship and that’s really critical with our hotel partners, is saying, “Yes we are charging 15%, but we are getting you incremental demand”, and you understand this very well from your points earlier about understanding what’s the incremental cost to that hotel, so a hotel room that goes empty that night, that’s zero revenue, zero profit. However, you fill that up at $100, well what’s the real cost to that? Well, the incremental cost is essentially nothing, you already paid for the mortgage. You’re just fighting over margin. GF: Exactly! So we take 15% out of 100%. It’s actually a very good deal for them, which is why they do it so it’s all fine. With us and Google is if we didn’t think we were getting a good ROI, we wouldn’t be spending it. Come on, it’s not just Google, well, whether it be Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, pick your channel, we are always looking to get the ROI, always looking, “Where can we optimize?”, and that’s one of the benefits we get to our hotelier friends, partners, is the idea is make sure that we are giving them a good ROI, and helping them out. Because if we don’t, they can go to Expedia more, there’s so many different ways they can distribute their rooms, because they want to maximize their bottom line. I mentioned how your position might give you more sympathy for your suppliers in this regard. Now that you’re, I think, are you still the only European company that’s been designated as a gatekeeper by the EU? GF: There are seven companies in the world that have been designated by the EU as gatekeepers. Unbelievably so, six of the seven are American, we’re one of them. We’re an American company, Booking Holdings is incorporated in the US, we are headquartered in the US. Booking.com is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings. Right. GF: The seventh company that’s a gatekeeper that’s not the US, though, maybe it will be very shortly is TikTok. So, there is no European company. Does that give you more sympathy for Google now that you’re feeling some of their pain? (laughing) GF: This is one of the things that I talked to the EU about, I talked to many people about this. I absolutely believe, I absolutely believe that the DMA, the way to set up its gatekeepers is not set up correctly. The idea that we, in one of the most competitive industries in the world, and I had a good headline quote in the Financial Times in London once, I said, “We have to fight for a booking every day”, because it’s true. You’re just one click away from somebody choosing somebody else, it is incredibly competitive. So, the idea to put us in the same bucket as trillion dollar businesses like Google and Amazon? That’s absurd, it’s absolutely absurd. And yet what it does, it creates the costs, and the things we have to deal with that are much more difficult, thereby making it actually, we have a lot of European employees, so it actually makes it more difficult for European employees there, it has to be able to expand, etc. To me it just baffles the mind and I believe somebody said, “Well, you want to talk about reason to stories? My story in this is it’s politics.” Well, all the hotels, to your point, they want all the customers you deliver them, and they don’t want to pay for them. GF: Of course not. They’ve complained about it. GF: Exactly. That’s absolutely right, and I understand that. Listen, that’s part of a free world, if you can lobby better than we can lobby, I guess it’s not good for economics, it’s not good for society, but it’s good for an individual player. I do have a bone of contention to pick with you, and you referenced it earlier. I, like many other professionals my age, was an extremely loyal Starwood member back in the day. It breaks my heart to see how Marriott has diminished those brands after acquiring Starwood in 2016 and the reason I’m blaming you, laying it at your feet, is it seems hotels realize that to avoid the way around you, or the way around aggregation in general is you need these super good loyalty programs and a good way to have that is to have the most hotels. So, I’m asking you, are you the reason why I now get crappy plastic cups, and uncomfortable pillows in Westin’s when that wasn’t the case before? Because you made all these guys consolidate, and try to get out from your fees? GF: So, I’d first like to say that I am also very fond of Marriott at all of their brands. (laughing) Of course you are! GF: And Hilton, and I can go through the entire list… That was on me, Glenn was grimacing the whole time for those that are listening. GF: (laughing) Right, right. Look, here’s the thing I believe that- I’m actually asking you in general about the hotel’s response to getting larger and things like that. GF: It’s not just hotels. Look, everybody’s trying to come up with, “How can I get the customers to be more loyal?”, I mean, American Express just sent out the bill, if I want to have a platinum card, it’s going to cost $895. Meanwhile, Chase Sapphire, they’re being the cheap guys at $795, and I think there’s a Capital One that I know, $495, whatever. Everybody’s playing the loyalty, trying and bring more benefits, and they all show that if you pay this yearly fee, look at all the great benefits you’re going to get for it, it’ll actually pay more. There’s nothing wrong with people coming up with new ways to try, and combine things to create more value and I have nothing against it. By the way, and I’ve been talking with all the big chains about this stuff. We need to have a relationship where I know they feel that if somebody booked with us who is a high status loyalty member, their company is saying, “Gee, is it fair for them to pay us the same amount of money they paid us somebody who’s never visited their hotels before?”, and I do agree with that, and we need to come up with a way that actually, while I’m not sure one will make any more money, or they’ll make any more money, but at least it’ll be a fair, and we used the word fair before, it’s a fair transaction. If we could imagine a model where the commission is different if they’ve put in their loyalty number, or something along those lines. GF: Totally, totally like that. Exactly. And by the way, and while we don’t do this, I mean look, some of these giant chains as big as they are, they don’t market to certain parts of the world. We market to people in Turkistan, or pick a place they don’t and we do things in over 40 languages, we have customer service for over 40 languages, they don’t. So, we are rolling benefits to them, that’s the thing they want is the incremental customer. I put that list of crises earlier. Was Airbnb a crisis when it came along, or do you feel like in the end they just actually expanded the market, more places to stay, more types of trips, whatever it might be? Or was it actually — what was your process of facing this orthogonal competitor? You still talked on your last earnings call about alternative bookings, is it still a real center of focus for you? GF: So, alternative accommodations in the last call, we talked about it over, I think it was 37% of our total room nights. Now when you add up what that number means, that’s almost a little under almost three quarters of the total number of room nights that Airbnb did, and we’ve outgrown them, 16 of the last 17 quarters we’ve grown faster. So, I’d say it’s a pretty big deal for us and it has been for some time. So one of those things that seemed like a crisis, and has actually turned out to be a huge opportunity. GF: It never was a crisis, it was just another area where we need to build, and we didn’t have the right processes, we didn’t have the right platform, we weren’t necessarily doing things as well as we could have. And by the way, I said this in my last call, I said, there’s still a lot of things we can improve in that product for our customers and our hosts in a way that they will prefer to use us more and that’s something which is good. That actually means there’s actually a lot of upside left for us, and I believe that, I really believe that. Is your key advantage just the fact that if I’m searching, if I search on Airbnb, it’s only Airbnbs. If I search on Expedia, I can see both then compare, or is there more that goes into it? GF: Well, I’d say that’s a big one right from the beginning and I’ve said this so many times that one of our advantages was that I did notice that [Airbnb CEO] Brian [Chesky] recently was talking about how they’re going to be in a lot more hotels. I’ve been saying that for years. Airbnb, I mean obviously it was a great idea, could create an entirely new market. There’s a lot of strategic decisions they’ve made in the last X number of years that I don’t completely get. GF: Well, so, I imagine that we will be seeing more of that competition coming from that area. But look, it’s all good. I like competition, it helps us all do a better job for both sides of the marketplace. So, something you’ve championed for a long time, well before AI, is this idea of delivering a Connected Trip, you bought OpenTable, and you’ve bought lots of other companies along the way. What is that? Explain, give me the high level thesis. How have you approached it? This feels a little like, “Let’s put ourselves in a pre-AI mind”, because I’m going to ask you how AI changes that. I’ll give you a preview of the next question. Is this a bit where it sounds good in theory, but it’s not actually the way customers operate? GF: So, a couple ways to approach this. One way I always like to explain it is when I was younger, much, much younger, and my family would set up a trip somewhere. There is a thing called a travel agent that was a human being, many times was a woman, and she knew a lot about our family, and what we liked, and how much we could afford and she’d come up with some ideas, and my parents would have conversation with her, and such, and then she’d come up with a couple things, and we’d buy it, and we had everything, all the things we needed, the flights, how to get to the airport, the hotels, what to do there, all that stuff, and we give her one check, my mother would write a check to her and be done. God forbid anything went wrong, we just called her, and she would fix it all. Magically it would all get fixed, it’ll all be fine. Now technology should be able to recreate that only much, much better, because the database doesn’t forget like I imagine the travel agent human probably did occasionally. Well, that, and it’s much more accessible. GF: It’s 24/7, 24/7, and in addition, which is really good, it has an ability to know so much more about what’s happening at the exact time, or in the future. So, for example, the human travel agent never would’ve been able to, when the plane is delayed by four hours to send out a text, and say, “Excuse me, Mr. Fogel, your plane right now will be late by four hours, but we have a different flight for you, would you like to change it? In addition now because you’re going to still arrive two hours late to your destination, we’ve already rearranged the car service for you, and in addition, so you’ll no longer make your dinner reservation, we’ve already tried to move that to a different time, but that restaurant doesn’t have availability at that later time, however, we have looked at three other restaurants that are in the near vicinity. Would you like to choose one of those instead, which has availability, and we’ll notify your partner so that person knows we’ll be there.” What I want is I want to have a third spouse in our, my wife, and relationship who does all of this for us. Only it’s not going to be human, it will be done digitally. Right. This all sounds amazing. But you launched the Connected Trip idea a long time ago, and in retrospect, particularly when you look at AI, and how AI can potentially do this, were you just way too early, and this sounds good in theory, but actually there’s so many difficulties in pulling this off? Where actually we just have a holding company of a bunch of different companies that in theory work together, but it’s not a doable project? GF: I do not disagree with you on your point that it’s taking a long time. Agree totally, but you have to think where we came from, all we had were hotels. We didn’t have a flight business at all, we really started that 2019, just started it. So, five years later, let’s round off, call it five years later, we now sell more airline tickets than any other third party distributor in the world except for China, a little different, so we’ll do it ex China. That’s amazing in just five years to do that. In addition, the increase our Attractions now, we had no attraction business at all, now we doubled the last quarter, we doubled the number of Attractions. Our car rental business continued to grow. Rides, instead of renting a car, you just get a ride service from the airport, or to the airport, insurance, so many things. We had to build all these different verticals, and now having done that now, bringing it together, using science, using data, analyzing it, making sure we are putting up the right offers at the right time with the right value to the right person so they get the best experience they can. And God forbid anything goes wrong, we as the person who actually has put it all together, with the relationship with everyone, we can fix it. Now that’s for the traveler. On the partner side, the supplier side, we’re giving incredible number of different opportunities for them to provide, get incremental demand by providing different values, different things. We have a thing called our Genius program where primarily the supplier fund discounts, because we’re giving it to certain customers who pay more, who are willing to do it more often, so we give more value to our supplier partners. Combining those two things, using again all the data analytics, it’s going to be wonderful. Now you’re right with generative AI, it may be easier to do all this stuff, don’t disagree with that. Your point, it’s hard is very correct, which is good, because if it was easy, there’d be a lot more people doing it. What’s more important? Is it the demand side, or the supplier side? And I know the answer is both. They’re both really important, or does it matter in different stages of the evolution of your company? For example, I thought it was really interesting, you made the point that agency model was important to get that demand, but over time, merchant actually lets you deliver a better experience for both sides, and so you’ve seen some transition there. Is that the case different when you’re building a network effect, which one comes first if you want to add on a connected experience? GF: I think the problem is when you’re overweight one side of that type of equation, you end up with real big problems and whether, I know you did a recent, it was very interesting interview with [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi], shout out for the interview you do with Dara because I thought it was fascinating, but it’s very similar network effect. If you have too many drivers, you’ve got a problem. If you don’t have enough drivers, and a lot more people want rides, you’ve got a problem. Same thing for us. If we have too much demand, and there is no supply, we’ve got a problem, the customer’s unhappy. Similar the other way, if a supplier puts out a line, they’re not getting any business, they get tired, and they stop working with you. Right. It’s like, “What’s the point of paying this 15%? I thought that I was supposed to be getting lots of customers”. GF: Well, no, don’t forget about they only pay the 15% if they get the demand. That’s a very important point to make out, which I continue to make to anyone who is interested in the issue of what value do we provide, I say, “Look at what we do here, we’ll take all the inventory, we’ll take the content, we’ll take the photos, we’ll give suggestions how to do things better, we will translate it into forty-something different languages, we’ll go out, and get demand, and we’ll make sure that your property is shown to the right customers. We do all of that, and I’m not going to charge you a thing, it’s free, absolutely free. The only thing I ask is if, if you get a customer who stays in your hotel, would you please pay us a fair commission?” That’s it, it’s a great deal. It’s a great deal for everybody, and for everybody who comes out, and says, “Oh, well they have too much power, or whatever”, people come out and say — I say, “What are you talking about? You don’t like it? Don’t join!”. Something Booking is hailed for, we were talking about this before in your story. I appreciate that I don’t want to land a specific narrative, it is what it is, we work hard, all those bits and pieces, just between you and I, however, is the actual answer to Booking’s durability, is it really just a network effect thing? This ties into what’s more important, demand or supply? The answer is both, they’re both important and you have both. Are network effects still underrated in terms of how you survive through paradigms? How do you avoid disruption? And the answer is if you have a network effect, you have the time and space to figure it out, and that’s okay because to your point, you’re motivated and you have the business model where both sides benefit. But do we still underrate these concepts you’ve been studying for so long? GF: I go the other way. I’d say that the network effect is overrated. Interesting. GF: Terribly overrated. Well, tell me why. GF: And a lot of antitrust people think that, and you can go back to the A&P cases way back, I don’t know how long, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, probably more actually maybe 70 years ago. The fact is that there are lots of very similar networks out there. You mentioned Bonvoy and Marriott, huge network effects there. Tremendous. All the airlines, tremendous. All our competitors, similar. Trip.com, they actually do more total travel value than we do probably. I tell you this idea that there’s some sort of lock-in effect, which is really what people start talking when they start networks, they start going to this idea of some sort of lock-in, there is no lock-in and I have the proof of so many of our customers do not spend a lot of their travel budget with us entirely. They use lots of different ways throughout the year, they’ll use us for some other times. They’ll go direct to the hotel, sometimes they’ll go to a tour operator, there’s so many different things. The data proves really that at least in travel, I won’t try and go beyond my expertise, in travel, the network effects are very low. There is incredible competition and those that say otherwise are ignoring the facts and the data and the science. I’m going to disagree with you slightly, but not completely, in that my contention is that the network effects enjoyed by your service, the aggregators, is because by definition you’re delivering value. To your point, hotels get free marketing until they actually make money and then you’re taking a commission on that. It’s not like they’re paying to get on there because you’re not the only way to reach customers, you have to earn it, quite literally. You have to actually deliver a booking. GF: Yeah, exactly. In fact, here’s the thing. Do you know in terms of Europe, our biggest market, we only have a single teens percentage of the market of hotels? That means 85% or roughly somewhere in that neighborhood of hotels that are being booked are not going through us. So anybody come up and say, “You have a 15% share, but you’re a dominant player”, is that not one of the craziest things you’ve ever heard? I mean, don’t get me started on European craziness, but I think the reason I’m pushing on this is network effects are a good thing. Being able to find any hotel in one place is convenient and it’s great. Being able to acquire more customers is convenient and great. GF: I agree. So that’s why I push back, I think there is network effects. GF: No, I agree. I’m saying not as big. So we’re just sort of arguing semantics. It’s not railroads, it’s not cables, that’s the problem. GF: I agree, totally. I’m saying it’s not as powerful as some people think it is. It definitely is, there’s value definitely, it’s just to my thing and there are a lot of others who have the exact same type of network. Where is Booking, when you look forward 5 to 10 years, is it still the arc we’re following? It’s this Connected Trip, we can tell, to your point, I think the problem with a lot of these Connected Trips ideas, particularly before, is it’s a good narrative. It sounds great, I’m going to have the travel agent deliver it and the number of edge cases and complexity in the real world is just so large, it’s never been doable. But is this a bit where actually, that’s probably right, but all that investment was worth it because suddenly it is doable. Did I just summarize what’s the next decade for you? GF: Well, I think you did. I mean our goal is to get that Connected Trip really in a way that a lot of people really see the values. I’m going to go to Booking because I get a lot more value through the Connected Trip and we’re seeing a little, like we did announce in our earnings call, how the growth of people who are buying more than one vertical in a trip has gone up. I believe it was over 30% is what we said a couple months ago. I just read it about an hour ago, so I remember that. GF: Okay, good, so my memory isn’t gone. If you notice, it broke into the double-digit percentage of our total amount of transactions, so it’s showing it is growing, but we are still so early. I believe this is one of these things where you do hit a phase transition, you build up the verticals, you start going, but then at some point, instead of it going linearly, you get exponential growth as people really catch on. This really is much better. Is this going to have to be a product-led growth strategy? Can you SEM yourself into this or is that you almost have to build a new muscle in that regard? GF: I think the marketing of it will be important to help get people aware of it, but I don’t want to put on a firehose of marketing until it’s really good. That makes sense. This is the other interesting point where you can have sympathy for hotels, you have your own loyalty program, you want people opening Booking first thing instead of going through Google to get there and you mentioned the Genius program and how your suppliers will help fund that because you’re consistently delivering more people. Is that a big focus going forward? Do you feel good about that? Is that going to be critical to getting the Connected Trip working? GF: What I really want to be able to do is help our partners do better, I want them to make more money than they would otherwise, I want them to have happier customers than they would otherwise. One of the ways that we’ll be able to do that is by providing them incremental demand right away. That’s great and all that, and I understand where somebody say, “I wish I didn’t have to pay a commission for that customer”, but I want to help make sure they understand that they wouldn’t have gotten that person. But there’s more. We know technology is now coming forward so rapidly, so many of these hotels, they don’t have IT departments, they don’t understand, they don’t know how to deal with this. We will do it for them for free. Again, all the things we do for them, and believe me, this is not dissimilar when you go back to the mid to late ’90s when hotels didn’t have websites, they didn’t know what to do or how to do this or whatever, somebody did it for them. Well that’s kind of now in this new world with all this new technology, we were able to provide the service to them again in a way that they will be better off, their bottom line’s improved. Do you think there’s a shift where you keep talking about, “You’re really valuable, people shouldn’t be mad at us, we’re providing incremental revenue to assets that are already there”, but there’s one thing that I think is interesting about the ultimate aggregators is in some respects they create their own supply and maybe this is where Airbnb was really interesting and got there first, and you’ve done a very good job catching up to them, but creating their own supply of rooms that only exist because Airbnb. I talk about Facebook creating an entire universe of e-commerce retailers that basically exists because of Facebook, that gives them real durability. What market can you create as opposed to servicing hotels that exist and we’re going to give you incremental revenue there or has that already happened? GF: I think you’re right. In both examples you gave, they did create new blue ocean markets that did not exist previously and more power to them for having done that. We, as you point out, we are basically making a markets more efficient, providing more value to people who are already into the marketplace. So for us to create a new market, we’d have to be going on to something that is not currently being done. Now, if we have such a thing, I would not be disclosing it right now. Right, fair enough. But it’s fair to say, and if you were to even do the Connected Trip, but most of the stuff, you’re not talking about Airbnb, Airbnb is still like, “We’re going to create experiences X, Y, Z”, you’re like, “No, you can get your car and then get your hotel and get your restaurant, that’s what Booking does, it makes it more efficient”. GF: And very important. But services, what we call Attractions, are very important because nobody goes on a trip to hang out in the hotel room, you go to do stuff. So whether it be the scuba trip, the snorkeling, the museum, the theater, whatever it is, we want to be able to provide that to them too. One of the examples of the Connected Trip, I always give an example that I love, which is you go to Amsterdam, the two things most people want to do, they want to take a canal boat ride in Amsterdam and they want to go to the Rijksmuseum because it’s very famous museum, great things. Now the thing is though, we want to be able to provide, which we can now, we provide it to both tickets for both things. Imagine you have booked the Thursday for the boat trip and the Friday for the museum. On Tuesday, however, we notice, we obviously see what the weather is and we come back say, “You know something, the rain is coming for your boat ride day and it’s going to be sunny the other day, so why don’t we switch them around for you and we can do it all. Would you like that? Press yes.” And we will do it all for you, that kind of convenience and that looking forward to provide what could be a problem beforehand, that’s real value. Those are the type of things absolutely a part of the Connected Trip. Is that another advantage of Booking in particular’s European roots? It always strikes me, all these European sites have their own technology stack from like 25 years ago, whereas U.S. is just like, “Yeah, that’s fine, we don’t want to do that, we’ll jump on sort of something else”. Is that a real opportunity to go in and provide a brand new technology stack for all these experiences telling them this is the advantage you’ll get? GF: So we have a company that’s the leader in the space, FareHarbor, which we own, which works for us and provides the backend ticketing and reservations for a lot of small and medium-sized Attraction players. We are the biggest player in the world in that, so that is our stack that we do provide, free again, to things and think of it as like OpenTable, which we also have only, FareHarbor’s for attractions, OpenTable for restaurants, etc. But you’re right, there are a lot of different backend systems, but the wonderful world of APIs, you can tie to anybody. Got it. Well, I could talk about Booking forever. Like I said, it’s such a textbook example and it’s so interesting that it’s on both sides of this equation, but did we get what you wanted to cover? GF: Yeah, it has been really fun, really interesting. I mean, it’s fascinating. As you’ve done in many of your interviews, you just scratch the surface because there’s so many interesting things in the topics that you cover, but this certainly is one, and today with Gen AI coming down the pike for all of us, how will the world change? It’s going to be a very interesting thing Google — are they going to be your most important channel forever? GF: Who knows, right? Who knows about that? And I would even more so are the big societal issues and these are the issues not so much about how we do our business, but how do all of us do our business and what are the impacts going to be in terms of employment, in terms of jobs? These are interesting things that I wish our government friends would spend a lot more time on that as opposed trying to guess what’s happening in small vertical areas. Do you think you might see a fork in the road where you want to deliver this experience in Booking and be that destination and tie it all together, but actually the ChatGPT’s of the world might actually be where all trip planning happens and you’re just going to have to, like you did with Google back in the day, accept that and be the best at that? GF: It’s certainly a possibility, we’ll see how it plays out. We are currently and have announced many relationships, many deals with many of the players in the space, and there’ll be many more in the future. Look, there are going to be people I absolutely know are going to go to a large language model provider and want to start their trip planning discovery there and I’m going to lament and say, “Why did they start with us first?”, it’ll be just like hotel, “Why didn’t they come direct?”, it’ll be the same thing, but I like to believe that we will create things that are so great the same way we have over 60% of our customers currently come to us direct. When you X out the B2B business, you go just the B2C business, over 60%, it’s mid-60s actually come to us direct. They’re not going to Google first, they’re not going to anybody. I would like that to actually be even a higher number down the road and they’re coming at the very beginning of their discovery area. But if they don’t, you’ll figure it out and be there. GF: If they don’t, we catch them later in the funnel and we’re still able to be able to get paid well, it’s all good. Glenn Fogel, thanks for coming on. GF: Thank you very much for having me.

Booking is one of my favorite companies in the world: they are a textbook Aggregator. And, in a fascinating twist, they are also among the best at managing Google, the biggest Aggregator of them all. In this interview we discuss both dynamics, starting from Priceline’s acquisition of Booking, the evolution of their business model, and where the company is going in the future. Along the way we discuss network effects and just how powerful they are, the challenges of building customer loyalty and being a destination site, and how AI might finally fulfill the longstanding dream of recreating the travel agent experience.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Glenn Faujelle, welcome to Stratechery. Glenn Fogel: (laughing) Fogel is the name but I will accept. I asked you and you said you wish you had what the French call you. GF: My wife would change the name if it was Faujelle, instead she doesn’t. She goes by her maiden name. Well, it’s appropriate because given Booking’s European roots, but we can get to all that in a moment. I’m very excited to talk to you, I love Booking, I feel like it’s a company I should have written about more. There’s just never been that right moment to really nail it, but you mentioned that you’re a reader, it fits so well with so many things that I’ve written about, all which I want to get to in this interview. But before we get to Booking and get to why I’m interested in it, I do want to start with you and your background, where you grew up, what you thought you would be, and if it would be someone who wants to make his name French because he’s such a big deal on the European continent. GF: Yeah, so I’ll be brief. I grew up outside New York City in the suburbs, very nice suburbia growing up. I have parents who were very into education, they didn’t have college degrees, but they believed the importance of going to school, so I worked very hard. I was 17, a junior in the spring and I was looking forward to in the fall applying to colleges and I had unfortunately a very serious stroke, paralyzed me on my right side, wiped out all my language capabilities, and spent some time coming back up and ended up going to college. How long did that take to recover from? GF: Well, actually because it was the spring of my junior year, I was able to go to college in a year from the following fall so it was a year and some months, I did go. But I worked extremely hard there, I got a degree in finance at what was the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School as an undergraduate, graduated actually early to save some money for my folks. Started working but not in finance, I was working in IT, I was at Morgan Stanley in what was then called MIS, it was their IT shop and that in 1984, but we still had punch card machines. We didn’t use them, but they were there. My first job was putting tapes on drives. Memory used to be in tapes — many of your listeners do not know anything I’m talking about — turned out, ended up doing coding, wasn’t great at it, said I should do something else. It’s the ’80s, M&A was booming, I said, “Well, I’d like to go over to the other side at Morgan Stanley where all those merger and acquisition bankers were making good money”. Can’t just jump from being an IT guy even though I had the finance degree, so I went and got a degree at Harvard Law School. Came out, no intention of being a lawyer, started right at an investment bank called Kidder, Peabody & Co. Rode it into the ground, went eventually went to nothing, got sold to Paine Webber, at which point they let go most of the bankers. So I lost my job, and while was not fun, it did give me the experience of having been let go. Right. GF: So I have that credential. Something you had to be the other end of many years later. GF: Right. Met a woman and eventually she said, “If this relationship’s going to go on, you should get a job”, so I end up being a trader at Morgan Stanley and I did that for a couple years in the late ’90s and the Internet’s booming and I’m saying, “Wow, that seems a lot more exciting”, and I have a background in IT, I got a background in finance, and there was this job at a company called Priceline.com, which was really the darlings of the Internet bubble, so to speak. Right, one of the most insane IPOs at that time. GF: Exactly. It went public in the spring of 1999, right away over a $30 billion valuation, which back then was real money. I didn’t join until February of 2000, I had gotten the job at the end of ’99 and I said, “Listen, I’ll come over, but I just want to get my bonus for Morgan Stanley, they don’t pay you until February, so I got to stay until February”. They said, “No problem”, so I leave my trading job end of February, one week before the NASDAQ peaks, thereby proving that I should not be a trader, having just top ticked the Internet, gone long Internet. So I did that, and the company’s worth about $15 billion at the time and we went down over towards the end of the year to just a couple hundred million dollars market cap. Stock eventually went down to a dollar a share, had to do a reverse split to get it up. Was it a good thing you got that bonus to sort of carry you through? GF: Yeah, it certainly, certainly was. Turns out your stock grant wasn’t worth very much! GF: But imagine what my wife was saying to me. “Let me get this straight now, you left a great paying job, a real good job at Morgan Stanley to this high-flying company?”, but it worked out okay. So the stock on reverse split, $6 a share, way back then, I’ve been there now 25 years and while we’re not quite up to $6,000 a share yet, it’s not far. So easy math almost 1,000 times in 25 years, so it’s worked out okay. Yeah, you’re still married, so I think that’s the biggest endorsement that it all worked out. You’ve talked in other interviews about that stroke and how it grounded you through difficult times and to your point, Booking’s had a few of them. You go back through the Dot Com crash — well, I guess Priceline I should start out with, we’ll get to the Booking portion in a moment. The Dot Com crash, obviously there was 9/11 shortly thereafter, not great for travel, there’s the Great Recession, COVID-19, I mentioned the layoffs bit before, Google’s SERP changes. Okay, maybe that one doesn’t quite fit with the other one, so we can get to that one another time. GF: No, it does. But how did that shape you? And balance, clearly you wanted to chase the big thing, you want to take some risks. What benefit did that bring to you in your leadership style? GF: Well, you listed a bunch and there were so many other very trying moments, many of which we’d have to fill up the entire discussion to go through all of them. But the one thing that’s consistent among all these things is, and it’s the idea that if you’ve been through a crisis, you’re better prepared to deal with the next one. Having actually been in the arena in fighting the fight helps you understand that when you’re in the next one, stay calm, understand what your options are, how to play it. Minimize where there’s potential losses, try and see what other avenues can you go down, maintain flexibility. So again, it’s one of those things when things seem to go all to hell to say, especially the most recent, that pandemic, and there were a lot of people in panic. I’m like, “Hey, been there before, let’s not panic”. In fact, we’ve been through that whole COVID thing, the SARS-1 issue back in 2003 and we’d actually seen the effect of that before. So it was like, “Been there, no, it’s okay, we’ll be fine”. Yeah, that’s a great perspective. I mean it’s funny because I was in Taiwan, went to Taiwan in 2003, and so I was aware of that at the time, it had sort of died down at that point, but it’s interesting to tie it back to that. You’d seen major disruption, people scared to travel. I did want to ask about Priceline, the initial model of which was, “name-your-own-price“, how insane was that in retrospect or do you still think it was a good idea? GF: Well, so the idea of coming up with an opaque process, meaning opaque, you don’t really know what you’re buying, but you’re willing to do it to save a lot of money. Right away that’s not a bad thing. Now if we look in economics, the idea of consumer surplus or supplier surplus, and you see what you end up where you have people, consumers, who either are getting a benefit — they’d be willing to pay more for something, but the price is not at that level. The idea was trying to match up, capture what the person was willing to sell it for, is very good when you have a product you’re selling with very, very low marginal costs. Yep, and somebody needs to stay at a hotel, or they’re not going to make anything. GF: Or an airline, it much more was the airline. So that airline seat, the marginal cost of that seat is essentially zero. Right. GF: So if the airline can fill that up with something without impacting its regular distribution channels because you don’t want to have any type of price cannibalization, and the way that it came out wasn’t a bad idea at all. The problem really was is there aren’t a lot of verticals that that really worked for, and people, for whatever reason, they just don’t like the idea as much about putting in a bid with whether you get no chance to back out. If you put that bid in and somebody accepts it, you got to pay that amount and you’re on and there’s no refund. That’s really interesting because I would think that a big problem with that is it’s offloading a lot of burden onto the customer. It feels very weighty. “Did I put the right price?”, “What do I do?”, “Should I be too high?”, “Should I be too low?”, or is that part and parcel of the fact you can’t back out, you’re locked in once you commit? Or are those two different threads? GF: Well, I think there are two things, but I think they go to the same point. Right, it’s too much cognitive weight on the customer. GF: It’s tremendous. And the thing is, human beings are odd. It’s interesting, one of the things that bothers people almost as much as overpaying is not overpaying but paying more — even though they’re comfortable paying it — more than what somebody else got. The sense of fairness, it permeates everything. GF: But it does because when somebody says, “What is being rich?”, being rich is having more money than your brother-in-law. It’s all relative, and that’s one of the issues too. So in the end, the idea of bidding, not great, but the idea of having opaque pricing with some type of trade-offs is still used a lot. We still have those types of things and people are willing to do it and let’s say we see it in many different instances where people are willing to take a trade-off in terms of what the quality of what you’re buying to get a better price. So we’re going to get to AI in a moment, but as long as we’re here, would AI have made that work better by reducing the cognitive load? Or maybe another way to ask this is will AI-driven variable pricing work in the future in a way that makes customers feel good? And not feeling like, “They know who I am and so they’re screwing me”? GF: It’s very interesting to think, “How will the world of the future be if everybody has an agent and the agent is able to instantly be always checking for prices?”. And at the same time, the seller also has an agent that’s always looking at what is the current price and how does that work? As markets get very, very transparent, it’s going to be very interesting. Now the topping of all this though will be regulations because it’s also interesting where again, this idea of fairness, and which is an interesting concept, of regulators coming out and saying, “Well, is that fair or not?”, where you could have two parties, the seller and the buyer, both feel it’s fine and they’re happy. But the regulator says, “That’s not a fair market”, and starts putting in rules. So I can’t predict really what’s going to happen, but I agree with you, it’s going to be very interesting how it plays out. So when you bought Booking in 2005, what was your mindset when you bought the company? And the reason I asked, did you just think you were expanding internationally buying another travel site? Both you and Expedia were being very aggressive at that time, or did you realize you were buying an entirely different business model? I’d love for you to explain to me the difference in how Priceline acquired rooms back then and what Booking did and why that ended up being a big deal? GF: Yeah, it’s a shame we don’t have enough time to really go into all the nitty-gritty. Oh, no, I actually think this part is super, super interesting. So spend as much time as you want. GF: Okay, so we have the name-your-own-price product at Priceline, and I come in and I’m corporate development and we want to expand internationally with name-your-own-price. So we’re doing it throughout the world, different ways we create different structures and one structure was we set up this joint venture type operation in Europe, it’s Priceline Europe. Terrible timing, 9/11, and then you have recession and we pull back, etc. so it’s a very, very small operation now in Europe and we let go a lot of the people and I am now actually in charge of that. And I’m saying, “This is the craziest thing in the world”, because the idea of name-your-own-price to get a flight from London to Paris when you can go on Ryanair and EasyJet and pay five pounds, you’re going to save 50%, so it’s £2.50, really? Who’s going to do that? You end up with Frankfurt. You go London, Frankfurt, Paris, nobody’s going to do that. We got to do stuff the old fashion way, in addition, hotels. So we stopped the flight stuff, that’s ridiculous, but the hotel thing is okay. Name-your-own-price for hotels, but still people like to know the price and they like to know what they’re getting exactly. So I’m looking around, who knows how to sell like that around here? And find a little company called Active Hotels in the UK. Meet up with the people, we end up buying that in 2004, $165 million US dollars with an earn out for the founders who I want to stay on because the real value in anything is the people, it’s not like a coal mine where you’ve got coal underground, this is the people, and so we create a structure that gives them the upside if we’re really successful. So that happens in, when did that happen? 2004, in the summer of 2004, we end up in the fall of 2004, I am introduced to the people at Booking.com who are based in Amsterdam. They have almost the exact same model as Active Hotel, they’re disclosing everything just like you normally would by hotels but both Active and Booking have something slightly different than how the really big player, Expedia back then was the big player, and some of the other ones are. The difference is if you went to Expedia, you put your credit card in and you are essentially being charged right there. Merchant model, it’s called. Expedia is acquiring the room and you’re buying it from Expedia. GF: Well no, they’re not actually. Legally, they don’t actually own the room. In fact, what they have is the money in their bank account. Oh, so they get float along the way. GF: Which they are not planning to pay the hotel until after the person actually stays in the hotel and back then it would’ve been like a month afterwards. Really bad for cash flow for the hotels, really good cash flow for Expedia. Active had a different way of doing it called the agency model, which was, we’ll take the credit card, but that’s only to guarantee that you’ll actually show up. We’re not actually taking the money, the money was not run, the credit card was not run. So essentially, when you showed up at the hotel under Active Hotels, you paid the hotel at the desk with your credit card, or cash, or whatever, then Active sent afterwards an invoice to the hotel to pay the commission on it, totally reverse in the way the cash flow works. Booking had the exact same model as Active Hotel. So the issue was the more business you did, the faster you grew, especially with Booking because they had to pay Google up front in that month, but they weren’t going to get paid for months later, the hotel was going to pay him months later. The faster you grew, the worst your negative cash flow can get worse, worse, worse, worse, worse. So that’s one of the reasons we were able to convince them to join our little band. So Booking came into, and we combined Active and Booking to one company, and we threw in Priceline Europe too. But Booking’s a better name, so we kept it as Booking.com, and that’s the story. But here’s the question, though. You’re able to buy them because they have this problematic cash cycle. GF: And we bought them because they were totally European base, pretty much, Active was mostly the UK, so they could share and we put the inventory together, so now they’re both better off. And look, you spend a lot of time talking about network effects, etc, well here where you really have a great benefit by being able to add a lot more of the inventory to show to a particular traveler. That’s one of the big benefits. For sure, we’re definitely going to get to all that, but I’m very curious about this because from my perspective, the agency model is a critical component of what makes Booking what it is, into the behemoth that it has become. I talk about Aggregation Theory, and one of the things is the scalability aspect, all aspects need to be scalable and with this model, you have more from a hotel perspective, more scalability, more ability to come on, and you don’t need these custom integrations or whatever it might be. To me, that seems essential, so you acquiring the agency model seems super important to me, and it’s really striking to hear actually you talk about the real downsides of it, and the reason why it was a struggle for these companies. GF: Well back then that was certainly one of the ways we were able to grow rapidly was because go to a hotel and say, “Listen, just give us your content, just give us your photos, just tell us the prices, we’ll put it on”. We don’t need to make a business deal, yeah. GF: Yeah, and then if somebody shows up, we’re going to send you an invoice, and please pay us. Now part of the problems in that model for a lot of people who tried that in the past, was the hotels didn’t pay. So in the US for example, the actual collection rate for a travel agency was very bad, hotels would just ignore the commission letter, say, “Who cares about them?”, so that was a critical part too was collections, having a system to be able to collect the commissions. That was critical, and one among many different things that was done at the time that really made it different than a lot of other companies that historically had always done the commission-based agency model. What I’m curious about is did you go in thinking, “Okay, Booking has this, we’re going to change it to our model”? And then was there a point where you realized, “No, actually for all the challenges that this model presents, it’s actually better”. Why is it better? Why did that matter? GF: What’s good is having both models, Priceline was always the merchant model starting out. When we went into Asia, and we have the agency model at Booking.com, I was concerned, “Would it still work there?”, so we also looked at another company, very, very small company called Agoda. And Agoda based in Bangkok, they had the merchant model, and we ended up buying Agoda too, and now we keep them separate brands, separate things. Now, both have agency and merchant in different ways at different places, and the consumer gets to chose and there are many reasons people choose one versus the other. But having more choice is really an important benefit when you’re going to a customer. And I’ll go on, it’s now in terms of the way people pay, it’s incredible. So I think we’re over 40 maybe now, different ways a consumer can pay us, and we take the money and send it to the hotel, which is really important. If you are a consumer in Shanghai, and you’re going to show up at a small little hotel in the South of France, and you want to show up at the desk and use your whatever, Alipay or your WeChat Pay, that French hotel’s going to say, “What are you talking about? Please give me euros”, and that’s not it, but we are in-between it. We will take the Alipay or WeChat Pay, and we will then put euros in the bank account of the French hotel. And by the way, it’ll be a lot cheaper for the French hotel than if they had gotten a credit card from the traveler, because the interchange is much higher than us putting money into their bank account. So the answer to your question is payments is really important it’s the reason why we do a tremendous amount of our business is now done in the merchant model, not the agency model. Interesting. GF: There are a lot of benefits to it. So the agency model got all these folks on board, and then over time once you had that relationship built in, you could circle back to the merchant model. That makes a lot of sense. GF: Right. Exactly. Going back to this buildup aspect, another critical piece of Booking from my perspective is that the hotel market in Europe, particularly 20 years ago, was far more fragmented. You just have a lot more independent hotels as opposed to the US being more chains and things along those lines. This seems to me to cut in multiple dimensions. First to the agency model point, that scalability bit and it being super easy to get linked up seems really important. And second, this really just landed you right in the sweet spot of an aggregator, where consumers see way more hotels than they would anywhere else. And from a hotel, you suddenly are seen by way more customers than anywhere else. This seems obvious now, I guess I’m stating things that seem clear about network effects, but did you realize this when you bought Booking — I’m just really curious, because the Booking acquisition was such a home run. One of the things you did as CEO was change the name, “Okay, we’ve held on to Priceline for too long, we are Booking”, again, it’s not a home run, it’s a grand slam. I’m just curious how much of this did you learn along the way versus, “Oh, this is how it’s going to happen”? GF: No, these are all well understood concepts long before we started buying hotel agencies, like Booking.com. I had studied network theory long before that and I mean the basis of the Internet, or even going either further back, and there’s the famous when you’re in school you learn about, “Well, one telephone has a value of nothing”. Metcalfe’s law, yeah. GF: Of course it is. Right, exactly. You start getting into, “Well what is the value of a network?”, Ii it the square of the number of nodes, or how do you want to figure out the math of what is? But sure, of course that was all well understood and recognized why it would be such a valuable, valuable thing to have. But everybody knew that, and didn’t matter whether we were agency or merchant, everyone has built a network as quickly as possible, as fast as possible. What’s interesting, of course, is why did some of the networks that were out front, they got really good, but then they die out where others continue? We don’t have time to go into that, and theories of why did MySpace die but Facebook lived? Well let’s do it in travel. Why did Booking, why did you pass Expedia? Why did you become the top dog? GF: There are a lot of reasons that go into a question, and here we go into the idea of coming up with the narrative fallacy, which it’s a famous saying. Where we’re going to create a story about why the world is the way it is today, it’s not provable. You’re tapping into what I keep trying to pry around the edges of, because I know the story you tell. There’s a story I look backwards and see, and this is all straightforward, and I’m just so curious about how you actually navigated this story way back then, when it’s, again, it’s really easy to look backwards and everything seems so obvious. GF: Of course, that’s the issue of the narrative fallacy. And I can tell my story, and you have your story, many people have many stories about it, but there’s no way to actually prove out what is true and what is not true. I do know that I have a belief of certain things that are very critical. I also know, and this is really important for anybody who’s in a business with anything in life really, is that so much of the ultimate results are going to be determined by things you have zero control over. I can’t control what our competitors do, I can’t control what governments do in terms of economics, I can’t control issues like natural disasters, and so many things are going to impact your business. In our business, my Lord, things hit us all the time, and the only thing we can do is control ourselves. So try and improve the products, improve the services, so that both sides of our marketplace, our travelers and our partners, both see value in participating at our business, at their free will and that’s very important for us is that look, no hotel in the world has to work with us, they do it because we give them value to do it. And by the way, some hotels don’t. I even stay at hotels that are not on our network, because they don’t want to be on our network, but I want to stay in that hotel. There’s a place in Lake George in upstate New York— That’s a lot of throat-clearing, though. So what is your narrative that you’re going to give my audience? What is the key thing why you surpassed everyone? GF: I won’t do that, and here’s why, because I give it, and then it gives it more weight, and more credence, and more belief that was the truth. There is no truth. The only thing I can say is part of the reason is we worked damn hard, part is we had really smart driven people who wanted to succeed. Part of it is they came up with ways to provide more service, more value to both sides than other players did and being a friendlier partner, being better customer service, really focusing on it, customer centricity, those things were really, really important, but that’s kind of like table stakes for a lot of companies do that. All right, fair enough. I’ll let you off the hook. Tell me about your relationship with Google. I don’t know if it’s still the case, I know for a long time you were the biggest Google ad spender and I believe that really happened around sort of the tail ends of the 2000s, early 2010s, when that really ramped up. Was that driven by Google’s change of the SERP and moving away from ten blue links into their own travel product, and you realized, “Hey, game’s changed, we have to approach this differently”? What was the process there, and how has that evolved? GF: Interesting, so when we were about to buy Booking.com, and we already owned Active Hotels, Active Hotels was very into SEO, all free search, very into that and they also had a lot of affiliates that were really bot farms, they were all farms, and we got a lot of business from them. Booking, on the other hand, and this is another reason we wanted to combine them both, is Booking was really into SEM [Search Engine Marketing], they were paying, and they really became really one of the first players that I’m aware of that did really big A/B testing, really interesting science going into that stuff. Right before we buy Booking, Google does a giant change in the algo, and we drop so much business on all the free clicks, it was like, “Wow, what’s happened?”. That’s when we really tilted more, “Okay, so we just have to keep paying more and more into Google”, and optimizing it so we actually have a good ROI, which we did, and continued to work on that. That was before 2010, that was 2005, 2006, 2007. Then of course, you have the financial crisis, etc., but we still power through that. And that’s it, now I have no idea who the biggest spenders are with Google now, Google does not disclose, we do spend a heck of a lot of money with them, it’s a very good relationship, we’re good partners. We have a similar goal, and that is to get customers to get what they want as soon as they can. I think that your approach to Google, for me, is a big part of the narrative story, and in two respects. Number one, there are other people in this space who got very large on SEO that basically their response to Google’s changes was to whine and whine incessantly for years and years and years and I feel there’s a very sort of pragmatic approach from Booking for years that, to your point, you can’t control what happens around you. You sort of play the hand that you’re dealt, and you dealt that by we’re going to pay. What I’m curious about is, and this is sort of part two, is there an aspect where you’re dealing with Google, the ultimate aggregator, gave you more sympathy for the hotels, and dealing with you and knowing how to deal with them since you’re sort of sitting on top of them in that role? Or was there the opposite where just shit flows downhill sort of as it might be? I’m just curious, you’re in a unique position of clearly being an aggregator, one of the most textbook aggregators ever, and yet also you have to be aggregated by Google, and sort of navigate that, and figure it out. GF: I do talk about this sometimes, it comes up. So we’ll have a hotel here, and let’s say we’re charting a 15% commission, and they’re not thrilled with having to pay 15% to us. Of course, we have to pay a big amount to Google to get the traffic to us, right? And so, you’re right, there is this relationship, and the big overall point is nobody likes to pay for marketing or distribution. Everybody would like all their business to come to them free, direct, loyal, again, and again, and again. People being people, that’s not exactly how the world works, so you do have to pay. Then the next thing is you want to at least make sure that it’s a fair relationship and that’s really critical with our hotel partners, is saying, “Yes we are charging 15%, but we are getting you incremental demand”, and you understand this very well from your points earlier about understanding what’s the incremental cost to that hotel, so a hotel room that goes empty that night, that’s zero revenue, zero profit. However, you fill that up at $100, well what’s the real cost to that? Well, the incremental cost is essentially nothing, you already paid for the mortgage. You’re just fighting over margin. GF: Exactly! So we take 15% out of 100%. It’s actually a very good deal for them, which is why they do it so it’s all fine. With us and Google is if we didn’t think we were getting a good ROI, we wouldn’t be spending it. Come on, it’s not just Google, well, whether it be Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, pick your channel, we are always looking to get the ROI, always looking, “Where can we optimize?”, and that’s one of the benefits we get to our hotelier friends, partners, is the idea is make sure that we are giving them a good ROI, and helping them out. Because if we don’t, they can go to Expedia more, there’s so many different ways they can distribute their rooms, because they want to maximize their bottom line. I mentioned how your position might give you more sympathy for your suppliers in this regard. Now that you’re, I think, are you still the only European company that’s been designated as a gatekeeper by the EU? GF: There are seven companies in the world that have been designated by the EU as gatekeepers. Unbelievably so, six of the seven are American, we’re one of them. We’re an American company, Booking Holdings is incorporated in the US, we are headquartered in the US. Booking.com is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings. Right. GF: The seventh company that’s a gatekeeper that’s not the US, though, maybe it will be very shortly is TikTok. So, there is no European company. Does that give you more sympathy for Google now that you’re feeling some of their pain? (laughing) GF: This is one of the things that I talked to the EU about, I talked to many people about this. I absolutely believe, I absolutely believe that the DMA, the way to set up its gatekeepers is not set up correctly. The idea that we, in one of the most competitive industries in the world, and I had a good headline quote in the Financial Times in London once, I said, “We have to fight for a booking every day”, because it’s true. You’re just one click away from somebody choosing somebody else, it is incredibly competitive. So, the idea to put us in the same bucket as trillion dollar businesses like Google and Amazon? That’s absurd, it’s absolutely absurd. And yet what it does, it creates the costs, and the things we have to deal with that are much more difficult, thereby making it actually, we have a lot of European employees, so it actually makes it more difficult for European employees there, it has to be able to expand, etc. To me it just baffles the mind and I believe somebody said, “Well, you want to talk about reason to stories? My story in this is it’s politics.” Well, all the hotels, to your point, they want all the customers you deliver them, and they don’t want to pay for them. GF: Of course not. They’ve complained about it. GF: Exactly. That’s absolutely right, and I understand that. Listen, that’s part of a free world, if you can lobby better than we can lobby, I guess it’s not good for economics, it’s not good for society, but it’s good for an individual player. I do have a bone of contention to pick with you, and you referenced it earlier. I, like many other professionals my age, was an extremely loyal Starwood member back in the day. It breaks my heart to see how Marriott has diminished those brands after acquiring Starwood in 2016 and the reason I’m blaming you, laying it at your feet, is it seems hotels realize that to avoid the way around you, or the way around aggregation in general is you need these super good loyalty programs and a good way to have that is to have the most hotels. So, I’m asking you, are you the reason why I now get crappy plastic cups, and uncomfortable pillows in Westin’s when that wasn’t the case before? Because you made all these guys consolidate, and try to get out from your fees? GF: So, I’d first like to say that I am also very fond of Marriott at all of their brands. (laughing) Of course you are! GF: And Hilton, and I can go through the entire list… That was on me, Glenn was grimacing the whole time for those that are listening. GF: (laughing) Right, right. Look, here’s the thing I believe that- I’m actually asking you in general about the hotel’s response to getting larger and things like that. GF: It’s not just hotels. Look, everybody’s trying to come up with, “How can I get the customers to be more loyal?”, I mean, American Express just sent out the bill, if I want to have a platinum card, it’s going to cost $895. Meanwhile, Chase Sapphire, they’re being the cheap guys at $795, and I think there’s a Capital One that I know, $495, whatever. Everybody’s playing the loyalty, trying and bring more benefits, and they all show that if you pay this yearly fee, look at all the great benefits you’re going to get for it, it’ll actually pay more. There’s nothing wrong with people coming up with new ways to try, and combine things to create more value and I have nothing against it. By the way, and I’ve been talking with all the big chains about this stuff. We need to have a relationship where I know they feel that if somebody booked with us who is a high status loyalty member, their company is saying, “Gee, is it fair for them to pay us the same amount of money they paid us somebody who’s never visited their hotels before?”, and I do agree with that, and we need to come up with a way that actually, while I’m not sure one will make any more money, or they’ll make any more money, but at least it’ll be a fair, and we used the word fair before, it’s a fair transaction. If we could imagine a model where the commission is different if they’ve put in their loyalty number, or something along those lines. GF: Totally, totally like that. Exactly. And by the way, and while we don’t do this, I mean look, some of these giant chains as big as they are, they don’t market to certain parts of the world. We market to people in Turkistan, or pick a place they don’t and we do things in over 40 languages, we have customer service for over 40 languages, they don’t. So, we are rolling benefits to them, that’s the thing they want is the incremental customer. I put that list of crises earlier. Was Airbnb a crisis when it came along, or do you feel like in the end they just actually expanded the market, more places to stay, more types of trips, whatever it might be? Or was it actually — what was your process of facing this orthogonal competitor? You still talked on your last earnings call about alternative bookings, is it still a real center of focus for you? GF: So, alternative accommodations in the last call, we talked about it over, I think it was 37% of our total room nights. Now when you add up what that number means, that’s almost a little under almost three quarters of the total number of room nights that Airbnb did, and we’ve outgrown them, 16 of the last 17 quarters we’ve grown faster. So, I’d say it’s a pretty big deal for us and it has been for some time. So one of those things that seemed like a crisis, and has actually turned out to be a huge opportunity. GF: It never was a crisis, it was just another area where we need to build, and we didn’t have the right processes, we didn’t have the right platform, we weren’t necessarily doing things as well as we could have. And by the way, I said this in my last call, I said, there’s still a lot of things we can improve in that product for our customers and our hosts in a way that they will prefer to use us more and that’s something which is good. That actually means there’s actually a lot of upside left for us, and I believe that, I really believe that. Is your key advantage just the fact that if I’m searching, if I search on Airbnb, it’s only Airbnbs. If I search on Expedia, I can see both then compare, or is there more that goes into it? GF: Well, I’d say that’s a big one right from the beginning and I’ve said this so many times that one of our advantages was that I did notice that [Airbnb CEO] Brian [Chesky] recently was talking about how they’re going to be in a lot more hotels. I’ve been saying that for years. Airbnb, I mean obviously it was a great idea, could create an entirely new market. There’s a lot of strategic decisions they’ve made in the last X number of years that I don’t completely get. GF: Well, so, I imagine that we will be seeing more of that competition coming from that area. But look, it’s all good. I like competition, it helps us all do a better job for both sides of the marketplace. So, something you’ve championed for a long time, well before AI, is this idea of delivering a Connected Trip, you bought OpenTable, and you’ve bought lots of other companies along the way. What is that? Explain, give me the high level thesis. How have you approached it? This feels a little like, “Let’s put ourselves in a pre-AI mind”, because I’m going to ask you how AI changes that. I’ll give you a preview of the next question. Is this a bit where it sounds good in theory, but it’s not actually the way customers operate? GF: So, a couple ways to approach this. One way I always like to explain it is when I was younger, much, much younger, and my family would set up a trip somewhere. There is a thing called a travel agent that was a human being, many times was a woman, and she knew a lot about our family, and what we liked, and how much we could afford and she’d come up with some ideas, and my parents would have conversation with her, and such, and then she’d come up with a couple things, and we’d buy it, and we had everything, all the things we needed, the flights, how to get to the airport, the hotels, what to do there, all that stuff, and we give her one check, my mother would write a check to her and be done. God forbid anything went wrong, we just called her, and she would fix it all. Magically it would all get fixed, it’ll all be fine. Now technology should be able to recreate that only much, much better, because the database doesn’t forget like I imagine the travel agent human probably did occasionally. Well, that, and it’s much more accessible. GF: It’s 24/7, 24/7, and in addition, which is really good, it has an ability to know so much more about what’s happening at the exact time, or in the future. So, for example, the human travel agent never would’ve been able to, when the plane is delayed by four hours to send out a text, and say, “Excuse me, Mr. Fogel, your plane right now will be late by four hours, but we have a different flight for you, would you like to change it? In addition now because you’re going to still arrive two hours late to your destination, we’ve already rearranged the car service for you, and in addition, so you’ll no longer make your dinner reservation, we’ve already tried to move that to a different time, but that restaurant doesn’t have availability at that later time, however, we have looked at three other restaurants that are in the near vicinity. Would you like to choose one of those instead, which has availability, and we’ll notify your partner so that person knows we’ll be there.” What I want is I want to have a third spouse in our, my wife, and relationship who does all of this for us. Only it’s not going to be human, it will be done digitally. Right. This all sounds amazing. But you launched the Connected Trip idea a long time ago, and in retrospect, particularly when you look at AI, and how AI can potentially do this, were you just way too early, and this sounds good in theory, but actually there’s so many difficulties in pulling this off? Where actually we just have a holding company of a bunch of different companies that in theory work together, but it’s not a doable project? GF: I do not disagree with you on your point that it’s taking a long time. Agree totally, but you have to think where we came from, all we had were hotels. We didn’t have a flight business at all, we really started that 2019, just started it. So, five years later, let’s round off, call it five years later, we now sell more airline tickets than any other third party distributor in the world except for China, a little different, so we’ll do it ex China. That’s amazing in just five years to do that. In addition, the increase our Attractions now, we had no attraction business at all, now we doubled the last quarter, we doubled the number of Attractions. Our car rental business continued to grow. Rides, instead of renting a car, you just get a ride service from the airport, or to the airport, insurance, so many things. We had to build all these different verticals, and now having done that now, bringing it together, using science, using data, analyzing it, making sure we are putting up the right offers at the right time with the right value to the right person so they get the best experience they can. And God forbid anything goes wrong, we as the person who actually has put it all together, with the relationship with everyone, we can fix it. Now that’s for the traveler. On the partner side, the supplier side, we’re giving incredible number of different opportunities for them to provide, get incremental demand by providing different values, different things. We have a thing called our Genius program where primarily the supplier fund discounts, because we’re giving it to certain customers who pay more, who are willing to do it more often, so we give more value to our supplier partners. Combining those two things, using again all the data analytics, it’s going to be wonderful. Now you’re right with generative AI, it may be easier to do all this stuff, don’t disagree with that. Your point, it’s hard is very correct, which is good, because if it was easy, there’d be a lot more people doing it. What’s more important? Is it the demand side, or the supplier side? And I know the answer is both. They’re both really important, or does it matter in different stages of the evolution of your company? For example, I thought it was really interesting, you made the point that agency model was important to get that demand, but over time, merchant actually lets you deliver a better experience for both sides, and so you’ve seen some transition there. Is that the case different when you’re building a network effect, which one comes first if you want to add on a connected experience? GF: I think the problem is when you’re overweight one side of that type of equation, you end up with real big problems and whether, I know you did a recent, it was very interesting interview with [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi], shout out for the interview you do with Dara because I thought it was fascinating, but it’s very similar network effect. If you have too many drivers, you’ve got a problem. If you don’t have enough drivers, and a lot more people want rides, you’ve got a problem. Same thing for us. If we have too much demand, and there is no supply, we’ve got a problem, the customer’s unhappy. Similar the other way, if a supplier puts out a line, they’re not getting any business, they get tired, and they stop working with you. Right. It’s like, “What’s the point of paying this 15%? I thought that I was supposed to be getting lots of customers”. GF: Well, no, don’t forget about they only pay the 15% if they get the demand. That’s a very important point to make out, which I continue to make to anyone who is interested in the issue of what value do we provide, I say, “Look at what we do here, we’ll take all the inventory, we’ll take the content, we’ll take the photos, we’ll give suggestions how to do things better, we will translate it into forty-something different languages, we’ll go out, and get demand, and we’ll make sure that your property is shown to the right customers. We do all of that, and I’m not going to charge you a thing, it’s free, absolutely free. The only thing I ask is if, if you get a customer who stays in your hotel, would you please pay us a fair commission?” That’s it, it’s a great deal. It’s a great deal for everybody, and for everybody who comes out, and says, “Oh, well they have too much power, or whatever”, people come out and say — I say, “What are you talking about? You don’t like it? Don’t join!”. Something Booking is hailed for, we were talking about this before in your story. I appreciate that I don’t want to land a specific narrative, it is what it is, we work hard, all those bits and pieces, just between you and I, however, is the actual answer to Booking’s durability, is it really just a network effect thing? This ties into what’s more important, demand or supply? The answer is both, they’re both important and you have both. Are network effects still underrated in terms of how you survive through paradigms? How do you avoid disruption? And the answer is if you have a network effect, you have the time and space to figure it out, and that’s okay because to your point, you’re motivated and you have the business model where both sides benefit. But do we still underrate these concepts you’ve been studying for so long? GF: I go the other way. I’d say that the network effect is overrated. Interesting. GF: Terribly overrated. Well, tell me why. GF: And a lot of antitrust people think that, and you can go back to the A&P cases way back, I don’t know how long, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, probably more actually maybe 70 years ago. The fact is that there are lots of very similar networks out there. You mentioned Bonvoy and Marriott, huge network effects there. Tremendous. All the airlines, tremendous. All our competitors, similar. Trip.com, they actually do more total travel value than we do probably. I tell you this idea that there’s some sort of lock-in effect, which is really what people start talking when they start networks, they start going to this idea of some sort of lock-in, there is no lock-in and I have the proof of so many of our customers do not spend a lot of their travel budget with us entirely. They use lots of different ways throughout the year, they’ll use us for some other times. They’ll go direct to the hotel, sometimes they’ll go to a tour operator, there’s so many different things. The data proves really that at least in travel, I won’t try and go beyond my expertise, in travel, the network effects are very low. There is incredible competition and those that say otherwise are ignoring the facts and the data and the science. I’m going to disagree with you slightly, but not completely, in that my contention is that the network effects enjoyed by your service, the aggregators, is because by definition you’re delivering value. To your point, hotels get free marketing until they actually make money and then you’re taking a commission on that. It’s not like they’re paying to get on there because you’re not the only way to reach customers, you have to earn it, quite literally. You have to actually deliver a booking. GF: Yeah, exactly. In fact, here’s the thing. Do you know in terms of Europe, our biggest market, we only have a single teens percentage of the market of hotels? That means 85% or roughly somewhere in that neighborhood of hotels that are being booked are not going through us. So anybody come up and say, “You have a 15% share, but you’re a dominant player”, is that not one of the craziest things you’ve ever heard? I mean, don’t get me started on European craziness, but I think the reason I’m pushing on this is network effects are a good thing. Being able to find any hotel in one place is convenient and it’s great. Being able to acquire more customers is convenient and great. GF: I agree. So that’s why I push back, I think there is network effects. GF: No, I agree. I’m saying not as big. So we’re just sort of arguing semantics. It’s not railroads, it’s not cables, that’s the problem. GF: I agree, totally. I’m saying it’s not as powerful as some people think it is. It definitely is, there’s value definitely, it’s just to my thing and there are a lot of others who have the exact same type of network. Where is Booking, when you look forward 5 to 10 years, is it still the arc we’re following? It’s this Connected Trip, we can tell, to your point, I think the problem with a lot of these Connected Trips ideas, particularly before, is it’s a good narrative. It sounds great, I’m going to have the travel agent deliver it and the number of edge cases and complexity in the real world is just so large, it’s never been doable. But is this a bit where actually, that’s probably right, but all that investment was worth it because suddenly it is doable. Did I just summarize what’s the next decade for you? GF: Well, I think you did. I mean our goal is to get that Connected Trip really in a way that a lot of people really see the values. I’m going to go to Booking because I get a lot more value through the Connected Trip and we’re seeing a little, like we did announce in our earnings call, how the growth of people who are buying more than one vertical in a trip has gone up. I believe it was over 30% is what we said a couple months ago. I just read it about an hour ago, so I remember that. GF: Okay, good, so my memory isn’t gone. If you notice, it broke into the double-digit percentage of our total amount of transactions, so it’s showing it is growing, but we are still so early. I believe this is one of these things where you do hit a phase transition, you build up the verticals, you start going, but then at some point, instead of it going linearly, you get exponential growth as people really catch on. This really is much better. Is this going to have to be a product-led growth strategy? Can you SEM yourself into this or is that you almost have to build a new muscle in that regard? GF: I think the marketing of it will be important to help get people aware of it, but I don’t want to put on a firehose of marketing until it’s really good. That makes sense. This is the other interesting point where you can have sympathy for hotels, you have your own loyalty program, you want people opening Booking first thing instead of going through Google to get there and you mentioned the Genius program and how your suppliers will help fund that because you’re consistently delivering more people. Is that a big focus going forward? Do you feel good about that? Is that going to be critical to getting the Connected Trip working? GF: What I really want to be able to do is help our partners do better, I want them to make more money than they would otherwise, I want them to have happier customers than they would otherwise. One of the ways that we’ll be able to do that is by providing them incremental demand right away. That’s great and all that, and I understand where somebody say, “I wish I didn’t have to pay a commission for that customer”, but I want to help make sure they understand that they wouldn’t have gotten that person. But there’s more. We know technology is now coming forward so rapidly, so many of these hotels, they don’t have IT departments, they don’t understand, they don’t know how to deal with this. We will do it for them for free. Again, all the things we do for them, and believe me, this is not dissimilar when you go back to the mid to late ’90s when hotels didn’t have websites, they didn’t know what to do or how to do this or whatever, somebody did it for them. Well that’s kind of now in this new world with all this new technology, we were able to provide the service to them again in a way that they will be better off, their bottom line’s improved. Do you think there’s a shift where you keep talking about, “You’re really valuable, people shouldn’t be mad at us, we’re providing incremental revenue to assets that are already there”, but there’s one thing that I think is interesting about the ultimate aggregators is in some respects they create their own supply and maybe this is where Airbnb was really interesting and got there first, and you’ve done a very good job catching up to them, but creating their own supply of rooms that only exist because Airbnb. I talk about Facebook creating an entire universe of e-commerce retailers that basically exists because of Facebook, that gives them real durability. What market can you create as opposed to servicing hotels that exist and we’re going to give you incremental revenue there or has that already happened? GF: I think you’re right. In both examples you gave, they did create new blue ocean markets that did not exist previously and more power to them for having done that. We, as you point out, we are basically making a markets more efficient, providing more value to people who are already into the marketplace. So for us to create a new market, we’d have to be going on to something that is not currently being done. Now, if we have such a thing, I would not be disclosing it right now. Right, fair enough. But it’s fair to say, and if you were to even do the Connected Trip, but most of the stuff, you’re not talking about Airbnb, Airbnb is still like, “We’re going to create experiences X, Y, Z”, you’re like, “No, you can get your car and then get your hotel and get your restaurant, that’s what Booking does, it makes it more efficient”. GF: And very important. But services, what we call Attractions, are very important because nobody goes on a trip to hang out in the hotel room, you go to do stuff. So whether it be the scuba trip, the snorkeling, the museum, the theater, whatever it is, we want to be able to provide that to them too. One of the examples of the Connected Trip, I always give an example that I love, which is you go to Amsterdam, the two things most people want to do, they want to take a canal boat ride in Amsterdam and they want to go to the Rijksmuseum because it’s very famous museum, great things. Now the thing is though, we want to be able to provide, which we can now, we provide it to both tickets for both things. Imagine you have booked the Thursday for the boat trip and the Friday for the museum. On Tuesday, however, we notice, we obviously see what the weather is and we come back say, “You know something, the rain is coming for your boat ride day and it’s going to be sunny the other day, so why don’t we switch them around for you and we can do it all. Would you like that? Press yes.” And we will do it all for you, that kind of convenience and that looking forward to provide what could be a problem beforehand, that’s real value. Those are the type of things absolutely a part of the Connected Trip. Is that another advantage of Booking in particular’s European roots? It always strikes me, all these European sites have their own technology stack from like 25 years ago, whereas U.S. is just like, “Yeah, that’s fine, we don’t want to do that, we’ll jump on sort of something else”. Is that a real opportunity to go in and provide a brand new technology stack for all these experiences telling them this is the advantage you’ll get? GF: So we have a company that’s the leader in the space, FareHarbor, which we own, which works for us and provides the backend ticketing and reservations for a lot of small and medium-sized Attraction players. We are the biggest player in the world in that, so that is our stack that we do provide, free again, to things and think of it as like OpenTable, which we also have only, FareHarbor’s for attractions, OpenTable for restaurants, etc. But you’re right, there are a lot of different backend systems, but the wonderful world of APIs, you can tie to anybody. Got it. Well, I could talk about Booking forever. Like I said, it’s such a textbook example and it’s so interesting that it’s on both sides of this equation, but did we get what you wanted to cover? GF: Yeah, it has been really fun, really interesting. I mean, it’s fascinating. As you’ve done in many of your interviews, you just scratch the surface because there’s so many interesting things in the topics that you cover, but this certainly is one, and today with Gen AI coming down the pike for all of us, how will the world change? It’s going to be a very interesting thing Google — are they going to be your most important channel forever? GF: Who knows, right? Who knows about that? And I would even more so are the big societal issues and these are the issues not so much about how we do our business, but how do all of us do our business and what are the impacts going to be in terms of employment, in terms of jobs? These are interesting things that I wish our government friends would spend a lot more time on that as opposed trying to guess what’s happening in small vertical areas. Do you think you might see a fork in the road where you want to deliver this experience in Booking and be that destination and tie it all together, but actually the ChatGPT’s of the world might actually be where all trip planning happens and you’re just going to have to, like you did with Google back in the day, accept that and be the best at that? GF: It’s certainly a possibility, we’ll see how it plays out. We are currently and have announced many relationships, many deals with many of the players in the space, and there’ll be many more in the future. Look, there are going to be people I absolutely know are going to go to a large language model provider and want to start their trip planning discovery there and I’m going to lament and say, “Why did they start with us first?”, it’ll be just like hotel, “Why didn’t they come direct?”, it’ll be the same thing, but I like to believe that we will create things that are so great the same way we have over 60% of our customers currently come to us direct. When you X out the B2B business, you go just the B2C business, over 60%, it’s mid-60s actually come to us direct. They’re not going to Google first, they’re not going to anybody. I would like that to actually be even a higher number down the road and they’re coming at the very beginning of their discovery area. But if they don’t, you’ll figure it out and be there. GF: If they don’t, we catch them later in the funnel and we’re still able to be able to get paid well, it’s all good. Glenn Fogel, thanks for coming on. GF: Thank you very much for having me.

Title: Opendoor Hits Pause After Massive Rally—Here’s Why
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/25/opendoor-hits-pause-after-massive-rally-heres-why/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T09:30:59Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) has experienced an exhilarating journey this year. The stock has skyrocketed by 345% year-to-date, only to fall by 21% over the past week, serving as a strong reminder to investors that growth stocks seldom move in a linear fashion. Opendoor’s significant surge is indicative of robust growth in its key iBuying sector. In 2024, the company handled over $12 billion in home transactions, a rise from roughly $7 billion in 2023, as it ventured into new markets and enhanced its pricing algorithms. Revenue has consistently increased, anticipating an estimated $4.05 billion in 2025, while operational advancements have modestly decreased average holding times for homes, from 45 days in 2023 to around 38 days in 2024. If you are looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has notably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—achieving returns of over 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Can Uber Stock Grow $2x? The 21% decline last week seems primarily linked to profit-taking following the substantial year-to-date gains, along with immediate concerns regarding the overall housing market. Increasing mortgage rates and affordability challenges could temporarily reduce transaction volumes, causing investors to pause and reevaluate. Despite the recent downturn, Opendoor continues to be a key player in the tech-oriented real estate sector. The company is still operating at a loss—projected to be about $234 million in 2025—but is progressively enhancing its unit economics. Its combination of technology, market expansion, and transaction volume positions it for potential profitable scaling as housing market conditions normalize. The recent decline could represent a purchasing opportunity for long-term investors who believe in Opendoor’s business model. Its revenue growth, enhanced operational efficiency, and market share increases indicate that while volatility may persist, the long-term narrative of digitizing the home-buying process remains strong. In summary, Opendoor is a stock suited for those willing to navigate the ups and downs, supported by genuine growth metrics rather than mere hype. Investors must be ready for considerable volatility and the possibility of significant losses if market conditions worsen or if the company does not successfully implement its ambitious growth objectives. Although the 2x upside potential appears mathematically plausible based on forecasted revenues, it necessitates impeccable execution in a rapidly changing and competitive market landscape. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that?Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with decreased risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The labour cost is still lower in India | Photo Credit: DEEPAK KR Much before US President Trump’s decision to increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000 from the existing fees ranging between $2,500 and $5,000, the red line was drawn when he hosted 33 Silicon Valley leaders (including five Indian-origin top executives such as Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella) at the White House. Although the meeting was about artificial intelligence and US investment, behind the scenes the talk was about a paradigm shift — how AI programming tools can now generate thousands of lines of code quickly, reducing demand for junior software engineers. This may explain why major US tech companies such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft, have been consistently laying off workers in recent times, particularly before the hike in H-1B visa fees. In fact, the US-based IT firms are more dependent on H-1B visas than Indian IT firms. Even in India, the top six IT firms added just 3,847 employees in Q1FY26, a 72 per cent drop from Q4FY25. TCS made national headlines for laying off 12,200 employees, which is about 2 per cent of its global workforce. Although we are worried about the fate of around 400,000 Indian IT workers whose H-1B visas may not be renewed in the event of this fee hike, such a thing was bound to happen. Region-wise, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas, accounting for 71 per cent of 3,99,395 in H-1B visas 2024, while China was a distant second at 11.7 per cent. Market participants had anticipated a sharp fall in stock prices of Indian IT companies heavily reliant on the US market when the stock market opened on Monday after the announcement. By the end of trading day, these stocks declined an average of 3.4 per cent. AI, automation, and cloud computing are changing the face of tech hiring, something which came too quickly, especially when there is a growing pool of computer science graduates specialising in coding that has been growing over the years. Graduating with a degree in computer science became a fad, with top tech executives, billionaires, and even US presidents promoting the field and encouraging students to learn coding. Throughout the past decade, a degree in computer science was yielding results, with fresh graduates in the US starting off with salaries exceeding $100,000 plus substantial bonuses and stock grants. Same trends were noticed in India and elsewhere across the globe. Like in the US, in India, there is a craze for admitting students to computer science programmes, with recent estimates suggesting India is producing in excess of one million engineering graduates every year. This has led to excess supply, particularly in the age of AI driven technological change. This is akin to the cobweb model in economics, where farmers grow a particular crop in response to higher price signals in the present period, only to realise there is excess supply in the next period. We are witnessing a similar event now but spread across a longer time horizon to adjust for the technological change. Entry-level hiring by Indian IT firms has dropped sharply from pre-Covid levels. The same can perhaps be said of employment generation, generally speaking, in the organised sector. India (like elsewhere in the world) is slowly transforming into a gig economy where the labour market is increasingly characterised by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work. Private studies have shown that over half of Indian companies have more than 20 per cent of their workforce as contingent workers. The Periodic Labour Force Surveys corroborate this trend. In fact, most of the hiring in manufacturing, whether by the government or by private corporate enterprises, is now being increasingly outsourced to private contract suppliers. That things change so rapidly, requiring adjustments from both industry and the education system, is not new. Even the advent of computers and technology that marked the rise in productivity during the last century required adjustments. Alongside computers, electricity, combustible engines and refrigeration aided economic growth through a more productive labour force and necessary training. This has led to the creation of thousands of jobs in manufacturing. In the age of big data analytics, machine and deep learning, there is an apprehension that machines are increasingly taking over jobs performed by humans. But that is not entirely true. Newer types of jobs are opening up and it is in this transition phase that things will be little difficult. According to an August 2025 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates, ranging between 6.1 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively. That is more than double the unemployment rate among recent biology and art history graduates, which is just around 3 per cent. In an ironic twist, job applicants leverage AI tools such as Simplify to mass-customise their resumes and applications, only to have companies use similar AI technology to automatically screen them out. The silver lining for India is that irrespective of Trump’s hike in visa fees, it will lead to more offshoring. The labour cost is still lower in India, which has a high number of STEM graduates. It will only bolster investment in Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India accounts for 55 per cent of the world’s GCC centres (according to IBEF), employing around 1.9 million people. For the existing talented Indian IT workers other opportunities are opening up, for instance, China now announced issuance of K visa after Trump announced a hike in visa fees. Middle-East countries and the UK are other places waiting to welcome these skilled workers from India.
