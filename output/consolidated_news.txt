by Mike June 26, 2025 Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it â these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My momâs boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but itâs still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, âI got a rock.â Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasnât going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says youâre family, just remember that itâs the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasnât so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidaysâ¦..Iâm Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word âHopeâ. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partnerâs company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said âhappy appreciation weekâ. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, âshe did not want me missing the company bonusâ. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldnât wear denim at work so the only time weâd be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when weâd have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we canât wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places donât give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Couldâve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we canât wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. Iâm guessing OP didnât get a new car as a gift, soâ¦ got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a âfree turkeyâ around the holidays. It wasnât really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didnât cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurantâs âsignatureâ steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. Weâve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat âfor the companyâ. We didnât get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Luxembourg-based Quintet Private Bank, with operations across Europe and the UK, has integrated private markets exposure into its client portfolios. Clients with relevant portfolios can now access actively managed exposure to alternative assets, including private equity, private credit, and real assets. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more These are offered through selected evergreen private markets funds, complementing traditional allocations to equities, fixed income, and commodities. This integration was facilitated by a collaboration with BlackRock and the implementation of the European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) framework, effective since last year. This framework reduces liquidity and operational constraints, enabling continuous capital raising, reinvestment, and flexible redemptions. This allows investors to access private markets with simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional public markets. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Bryan Crawford, group head of investment & client solutions and member of the Authorized Management Committee at Quintet, said: “Diversification is a cornerstone of portfolio resilience, especially during periods of heightened volatility. “We are therefore delighted to partner with BlackRock to integrate exposure to private markets in client portfolios, supporting increased diversification and creating new opportunities to access long-term growth themes.” Quintet’s private markets offering includes BlackRock’s private markets platform, which manages over €600bn in assets pro forma across multi-alternatives and private equity strategies for investors in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. BlackRock EMEA Wealth Alternatives Specialists Team head Fabio Osta said: “By supporting the integration of private markets into wealth portfolios, we are making investing in alternatives easier and more accessible for a broader range of investors so they can benefit from the typically higher returns and diversification the asset class offers.” This announcement follows Quintet’s launch of multi-manager UCITS funds last year, also co-designed with BlackRock. These actively managed, single-asset-class funds, exclusive to Quintet clients, combine third-party managers to enhance diversification and portfolio performance. Earlier this year, Quintet introduced Future+, a sustainable investment mandate developed with BlackRock, adhering to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/college-graduates-face-toughest-job-market-decade-hiring-123221189
Time Published: 2025-06-26T09:46:25Z
Full Content:
Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade WASHINGTON -- While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

June 26, 2025 05:45 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Cryogenic Insulation Market Opportunities and Strategies to 2034" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The cryogenic insulation market is projected for significant expansion from 2019 to 2034, with comprehensive insights into regional dynamics and economic impacts. This growing sector reached a value of approximately $7.05 billion in 2024, recording a CAGR of 4.16% since 2019. The market is expected to rise further, reaching $9.52 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 6.18% and projecting continued growth to $12.42 billion by 2034 with a CAGR of 5.46%. Historically, growth drivers included aerospace expansion, increased demand for cold chain logistics, and governmental policy support. However, the market faced challenges from stringent insulation material regulations. Looking forward, the market is poised to benefit from rising LNG demand, expanding industrial gas applications, and clean energy initiatives, although high initial investment costs and supply chain disruptions could pose challenges. In 2024, Asia-Pacific dominated the cryogenic insulation market, contributing $2.87 billion (40.67%) of the total. Continued growth is anticipated in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe, with CAGRs of 7.47% and 6.09% respectively. Other promising markets include the Middle East and South America, expected to grow at CAGRs of 5.78% and 5.45% respectively. The market landscape remains fragmented, with the top ten competitors holding a combined 24.15% share in 2023. BASF SE led the sector with a 3.57% market share, closely followed by players like Armacell International Holding GmbH and Lydall Inc. Product segmentation includes cellular, fibrous, flake, granular, reflective, and other types, with cellular being the largest segment (50.73% in 2024) and reflective expected to show the fastest growth (CAGR of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029). In terms of application, storage tanks represented the largest segment (36.75% in 2024), while the terminals segment promises rapid growth (CAGR 6.96%). The energy and power industry remains the primary end-use sector, with the anticipated accelerated growth at a CAGR of 7.25% by 2029. Significant opportunities exist across segments, particularly in the cellular market (projected $1.3 billion gain by 2029) and storage tanks ($1.0 billion). The energy segment alone could see a $1.14 billion increase by 2029. Notably, China is poised to gain $606.38 million within the sector. Strategic approaches for market players include developing partnerships to enhance innovation, advancing hydrogen storage solutions, and launching high-performance insulation panels. Companies are advised to implement pricing strategies, expand digitally, and leverage partnerships for added value.

Title: How Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, and Others Say AI Will Reshape Staffing
URL: https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-duolingo-spotify-ai-reshape-staffing/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T07:02:23Z

Tech companies once blamed layoffs on overhiring and market shifts—now it’s AI. Recent statements from firms like Amazon, Shopify, British Telecom, Duolingo, and Klarna suggest that automation is reducing demand for human workers. As these companies pour heavily into AI, they’re simultaneously streamlining costs mostly through layoffs. In 2024, 549 tech firms laid off approximately 152,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. At the same time, many CEOs are championing “AI-first” strategies and touting productivity gains. But the workforce may not be ready, with only 62% of employees having received any AI-related training, even as companies push to scale AI across their operations, according to Gartner. “We’re at this moment where making big statements is about getting attention and drawing focus to the fact that AI is being used for real business impact,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK. “Rather than the tangible, long-term conversation around what does it really look like to re-skill and up-skill talent for a modern workforce.” Former Publicis chief strategist and growth officer Rishad Tobaccowala said the shift is also about rebalancing power. Companies may need 20% to 25% fewer people for the same output, he said, but that future will rely on a new kind of worker, one who can collaborate with AI. “People are talking about AI strategy… that’s the stupidest thing in the world,” he said. “You need to figure out how your entire strategy is changed because of AI.” Here’s what company leaders have said publicly about how they believe AI will impact their workforce, in alphabetical order. Amazon Action: Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees across multiple divisions. While the company initially cited macroeconomic uncertainty, recent statements from leadership suggest AI is becoming a key factor in how it envisions future staffing. What it said: In a June blog post, CEO Andy Jassy pointed to the company’s deep investment in generative AI—highlighting over 1,000 services and applications in progress—and signaled a shift in how work gets done. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents,” he wrote, “it should change the way our work is done… [and] we’ll need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” While Jassy didn’t specify which roles would be affected, he noted that the company expects to see workforce reductions in the coming years as it leans into AI-driven efficiency. Jassy also pointed to advertising as a clear example of AI integration, citing Amazon’s suite of tools that help brands plan, onboard, create, and optimize campaigns, used by over 50,000 advertisers in Q1. British Telecom Action: British Telecom plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, roughly 40% of its 130,000-person workforce. Of those, at least 10,000 roles could be replaced by AI, according to The Financial Times. What it said: CEO Allison Kirkby told FT the company is exploring the full impact of AI and suggested that, “depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” The company has already begun integrating generative AI into customer-facing roles, including sales and support operations. Duolingo Action: Cut around 10% of its contractor workforce in 2023, as it turns to AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to streamline content production and translations. What it said: CEO Luis von Ahn has positioned the company as “AI-first,” saying that achieving that vision means rethinking “much of how we work,” and “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, Duolingo is placing “constructive constraints” on hiring: headcount will only be approved if a team “cannot automate more of their work.” The company is also experimenting with AI in hiring and performance reviews. Klarna Action: Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40%, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski telling CNBC in May that the cuts are largely due to AI. The Swedish fintech company previously said it planned to shrink its headcount from 3,800 to 2,000 employees over the next few years. The company posted a $99 million loss in Q1, attributing it to one-off costs related to depreciation, share-based payments, and restructuring. What it said: In marketing specifically, CMO David Sandström told ADWEEK that team size reductions were driven in part by the growing capabilities of generative AI, and that further cuts could follow as the technology evolves. Shopify Action: Shopify has trimmed its workforce in the last two years, first by 14% in 2022, followed by another 20% in 2023. The company ended 2024 with 8,100 employees, down from 8,300 the previous year, per the company’s filing. What it said: In a memo to employees, which CEO Tobi Lütke posted on X, Shopify laid out a new baseline: “Reflexive AI usage,” in other words, all staffers tinkering with AI, is now expected across the company. Teams requesting headcount must first explain why the work can’t be done with AI. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke wrote. The company also said it plans to add AI-related questions to its performance and peer review processes. Trishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.

Title: Will AI really shrink workforces as Amazon boss says?

Andy Jassy is not the first executive to warn about the broader adoption of artificial intelligence and how it will fundamentally reshape workforces. Are the doomsayers right? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced that his company would reduce its workforce as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces human employees. He also warned that AI will affect a wide range of jobs and sectors. Jassy is not alone, as many other tech firms have issued similar warnings about how AI breakthroughs could reshape their workforces. In May, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic told the Arlington, Virginia-based American news website Axios that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. US public companies have reduced the number of their white-collar staff by a collective 3.5% over the past three years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing employment data provider Live Data Technologies. Over the past decade, one in five companies in the S&P 500 have shrunk, it said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Several tech companies, including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Procter & Gamble, have announced layoffs of thousands of workers over the past several months. Recently, retail service provider Shopify said that teams requesting additional staff would first need to prove that AI could not perform the tasks. Duolingo, a language-learning app, plans to replace its external workers with AI gradually. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that a quarter of jobs worldwide are at a high risk of being replaced by AI automation. But AI is also expected to create new opportunities and boost productivity. A report by the World Economic Forum earlier this year forecast that technological transformation would displace about 92 million existing jobs by 2030, while creating 170 million new ones. Jobs in developed economies will likely be more affected by AI than those in developing ones. A study published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year found that the technology could affect 60% of jobs in developed economies — around half of them negatively, while the other half will see a positive impact. The report concluded that about 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries would be hit. But while these labor markets may see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the increased productivity that AI promises. During past technological breakthroughs, lower-skilled and blue-collar workers bore the brunt, such as workers on factory floors being replaced by robots. However, broad AI adoption is expected to hit higher-educated, white-collar workers hard, particularly those with tasks that AI could perform at a similar or better quality than a human worker. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US found that occupations involving information gathering and data analysis, such as web developers, technical writers, accountants and data entry workers, among others, would be at high risk of being replaced by AI. Labor-intensive jobs that can't be easily automated, like construction workers, child care workers and firefighters, are expected to remain the most resilient. The possibility of massive job losses has triggered concerns over the disruptive effects of AI on employment and society, drawing the attention of politicians and even religious leaders, with Pope Leo XIV, who became the head of the Catholic Church in May, warning of the threat posed by AI to jobs and human dignity. Labor market expert Enzo Weber from the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg, Germany, believes that the concerns over job losses are misplaced. Speaking with DW, he said AI advancements open up a wide range of economic possibilities and are more likely to help workers than cause mass unemployment. "AI primarily changes work, but it does not fundamentally eliminate it," said Weber, adding that the technology in most cases helps human workers "develop new tasks and perform their tasks better rather than just replacing them." A paper published in January by Harvard economists David Deming, Christopher Ong and Lawrence H. Summers shared a similar view. The economists argue that the automation of individual job tasks "does not necessarily reduce employment" and may even lead to "job gains in some sectors" of the economy. "In principle, being able to automate a previously onerous task could make workers so much more productive that the increased output offsets the fact that some of their work is now being done by a machine," they stated in the paper. Stressing that the impact of AI is likely to be "widespread and long-lasting," they also wrote that "history teaches us that even if AI disrupts the labor market, its impact will unfold over many decades." Given that artificial intelligence technology is still in its early stages, its precise longer-term impact on global labor markets remains uncertain. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The efficacy of many AI tools will also depend on how well they are integrated into workplaces, and the willingness and ability of workers to use them. If workers refrain from making full use of AI out of concern for their jobs, it could compromise the productivity boost the new technology promises. Labor market expert Weber urges companies and workers to adapt to the changing technology landscape and seize the opportunities because for him AI technology is a "game changer." "This [technology] presents opportunities, but they need to be seized. Further development and active training of workers are essential. Not just to keep pace, but to get as far ahead as possible."

Title: Bitcoin's Bull Case Strengthens as Dollar Index Slides, Nvidia Hits Record High Amid Recession Cues

Bitcoin's BTC$107,069.07 price has rebounded nearly 10% from weekend lows, with key developments in traditional markets supporting the case for continued gains ahead. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. "DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin," Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. "We’re not there yet, but we’re dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That’s your cue. Watch it closely," Altrichter said. Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg, interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that’s inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It’s harsh, but that’s captialism, baby! Any organization (“org”) exists for a purpose that’s greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we’re just line items on somebody’s spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it’s merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says “We’re like a family here” what they mean is they’re going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective—executive leadership—isn’t a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you’d come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They’re optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can’t interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video “Caring Less About Work can get us what we really want”: If you’re going to work and and you’re getting frustrated and you’re intelligent and you’re looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, “How could they DO this?” or complain, “This is a dumb decision,” but executive leadership really is at arm’s length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they’re dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn’t care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it “does” says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We’re better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon’s razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises—do they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That’s the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We’re always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we’re unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who’s let go and for those who remain—until the next quarter—they don’t care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him “What’s it like to work there?” and he said “Oh, working here will rewire your brain.” Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome… Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn’t even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It’s a great flex for shareholders—so trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don’t do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they’re all wearing the latest fashions, whether it’s a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The “return to office” push is another such trend. There’s no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it’s not a “quiet layoff” it’s still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear—up to a full 5 days a week in a physical office—and when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs—not hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of “bottlenecks”, and that automation is the source of “solutions”, pay very, very, very close attention If people think “AI” can meaningfully replace human developers, we’re in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We’re left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we’re just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It’s an apt metaphor. I’m just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears—I can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there’s little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there’s plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern—it completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we’ll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a “canary in the coal mine”—if they’re comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they’re driven by ego or more interested in licking executives’ boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they’re just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It’s a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don’t have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles—empathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie—and that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we’ve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven’t been clear so far—the org won’t care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we’ll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don’t exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn’t the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it’s the only thing we truly control—applying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we’re doing extra work it should be clear to us why we’re doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to “volunteer” ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss “yes,” when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, “but not for free,” has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can “compensate” ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we’re getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team’s delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that’s not enough to justify the effort then we don’t do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can’t. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won’t. To each their own, I say. We can’t feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else’s circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we’re doing a good job. If we’re doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don’t need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn’t care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they’ll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of “recognition” could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as “The Only Person Who Knows How To Do X”. We’ll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don’t actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition—some could be legitimate career opportunities—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we’re between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we’re better prepared. We’ve already done some of the legwork that’d feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we’ve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it’s a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We’ll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we’re capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I’ve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I’d edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I’ve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they’re subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It’s the billionaires—and leaders who emulate them—that we need to worry about. So, I don’t have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I’ll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn’t have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they’re the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist—flourish, even—without the org eroding our personal values. We don’t want to be naive, but that doesn’t mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we’re doing well. It’s human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they’re not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn’t care about you is liberating! It’s not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I’m going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Use the controls in the far right panel to increase or decrease the number of terms automatically displayed (or to completely turn that feature off). Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model—constrained by more data—leads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies. Giuseppe Mascaro thanks funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awards #2212702: “CAS-Climate: A Novel Process-Driven Method for Flood Frequency Analysis Based on Mixed Distributions” and #2221803: “Collaborative Research: CAS—Climate: Improving Nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency Analysis of Extreme Precipitation by Advancing Knowledge on the Generating Mechanisms.” Battery electric vehicles show the lowest carbon footprints among passenger cars across 1.5–3.0 °C energy decarbonisation pathways, Šimaitis et al., Communications Earth & Environment Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty — or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Title: Bernie Sanders Slams Job Cuts, Says AI Should Give Workers More Time Off: 'Instead Of Throwing You Out On The Street...'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is advocating for a 32-hour workweek, citing the potential for advancements in artificial intelligence and automation to provide workers with more personal time. What Happened: Sanders, in a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, outlined his vision for a future where AI and automation drive increased productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced working hours for employees. “Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m going to reduce your workweek to 32 hours,” Sanders stated. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The Vermont senator underscored the potential benefits of technology for workers, suggesting it could offer more time for family, friends and education. Sanders introduced the “Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act” last year, which mandates overtime pay for any work beyond 32 hours in a week. The proposed change would be gradually implemented over a four-year period. See Also: Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share. Why It Matters: The proposal comes at a time when the impact of AI and automation on the workforce is a hot topic. Just days before Sanders’ podcast appearance, Microsoft MSFT announced its third round of layoffs for 2025, primarily targeting the sales team and other customer-facing roles. This move was attributed to AI-driven workforce shifts. Similarly, Amazon AMZN CEO Andy Jassy recently warned that AI would reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains, sparking backlash from employees. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that U.S. companies are short on workers who can code software, secure networks and run complex projects.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference—which is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now—and that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

Title: Devastating Layoffs Hit the Walt Disney Company

in Disney, Entertainment Credit: Disney In a recent report by TheWrap, it has been revealed that The Walt Disney Company is once again reducing its workforce, this time within its Entertainment and ESPN product and technology divisions. According to an unnamed source familiar with the matter, approximately 2% of the staff in these divisions has been let go as part of a broader rebalancing of resources. Despite the layoffs, Disney has emphasized that this move will not slow down its commitment to investing in product and technology growth. The company has been taking steps to streamline operations and adjust to the evolving media landscape, even as it continues to expand in other areas. This round of layoffs marks the fifth such occurrence in just a year at Disney. However, sources suggest that these cuts are distinct from previous ones, as they are not directly tied to any of the earlier rounds of job reductions. The decision is seen as part of Disney’s broader effort to optimize resources across its divisions, ensuring long-term success in the face of a rapidly changing entertainment environment. Led by Adam Smith, who joined Disney in 2024, the product and technology division has undergone significant changes under his leadership. Smith’s team has been actively working on enhancing Disney’s streaming platforms, particularly Disney+ and Hulu, with a focus on improving user experience and expanding subscriber perks. Notably, Disney has recently cracked down on password sharing for its streaming services, introduced new benefits for subscribers, and made strides in improving ad targeting through a new partnership with Amazon. Disney has also been exploring new ways to enhance the viewing experience. One of the latest initiatives includes the introduction of virtual “concessions stands” and “storefronts” within its streaming platforms, allowing viewers to purchase products directly related to the shows they are watching. Additionally, Disney is gearing up for the launch of a new ESPN streaming service later this fall, a move that marks the company’s continued push into the digital and sports streaming space. While these ongoing restructuring efforts are reshaping Disney’s internal operations, the company’s strategic goals remain focused on growth and innovation, particularly in the product and technology sectors. This wave of job cuts follows a larger trend of layoffs at Disney. Just earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its entertainment and corporate financial divisions. Back in early 2025, under 200 employees from ABC News Group and its entertainment networks were also let go. This followed a series of cuts last fall that saw hundreds of corporate employees and ABC staff members losing their jobs. As Disney continues to adapt to the changing media landscape, the company’s commitment to innovation and product development remains a central focus, despite the ongoing workforce reductions. As the year progresses, Disney fans and industry observers alike will be keeping a close eye on how these changes will affect the company’s future growth and strategic direction. in Disney, Entertainment Eva was born and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon but has since relocated and lives in New York City.

Δ The rise took the company’s market cap to about $3.75 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, CNBC reportedWednesday. The increase in Nvidia shares was driven by the company’s latest earnings results, which showed robust growth and potential for future strength, according to the Bloomberg report. While Nvidia faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China, the company also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building artificial intelligence infrastructure, the report said. The company’s stock price has risen 14% this year after rising 170% last year and leaping 240% in 2023, per the report. Wall Street remains optimistic about the stock because it is showing both high growth and a reasonable multiple, the report said. In a presentation released in conjunction with a shareholder meeting held Wednesday, Nvidia reported that its fiscal year 2025 revenue was up 114% year over year. At the meeting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in addition to AI, the company sees opportunities for growth in robotics, beginning with self-driving cars, according to the CNBC report. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said, per the report. Huang added that the business unit that includes automotive and robotics was up 72% on an annual basis and accounted for 1% of the company’s total revenue in the latest quarter, the report said. Together with its AI chips, Nvidia has increasingly been offering related products like software, a cloud service and networking chips, according to the report. Huang said in the shareholder meeting that Nvidia no longer thinks of itself as a “chip company” but rather as a provider of “AI infrastructure” or “computing platform,” per the report. During a May 28 earnings call, Huang said Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. “The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI,” Huang said. “Nvidia is ready.” Nvidia Shares Hit All-Time High as Companies Add AI Infrastructure Commerce Giants Expand Into Stores With New Debit and Credit Cards Fed Votes to Advance Proposal to Ease Banks’ Capital Requirements Apple Reportedly Set to Propose Easier Access to Offers Outside App Store We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Drivers across the US frustrated over their car’s paint jobs flaking off ‘in sheets,’ costing them thousands

Manage your account Thousands of drivers across the country are discovering their car paint jobs are literally peeling away — and fixing it could cost them thousands out of pocket. For Ed Rinkowitz, a Florida Hyundai owner, the flaky paint job is a familiar and frustrating sight. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it “My daughter's hood basically just flaked completely off, probably maybe 10% of the paint was left on it,” Rinkowitz told 10 Tampa Bay. “Then my wife’s car started and that was probably 30 to 40% that was coming off.” Rinkowitz says it’s the third Hyundai in his family with paint issues — and he’s far from alone. A Facebook group called “Hyundai Paint Peel / Peeling” has grown to over 6,000 members, all sharing stories of paint jobs seemingly disintegrating. So what’s causing the problem, and what can drivers do to protect their cars and wallets? While the issue spans several Hyundai models and paint colors, Rinkowitz says two of his affected vehicles were white — a trend echoed by dozens of other drivers. News station 10 Investigates also spoke with owners of Kia, Toyota and Chevrolet vehicles reporting similar issues. Rinkowitz brought his concerns to the dealership, but hit a wall. “I’ve got two white 2015 Elantras, very similar models, and they said, ‘Well, it’s not under warranty,’” he told 10 Investigates. Instead, he was told to go to a body shop — a fix he didn’t feel should fall on him. And it isn’t cheap. According to Bankrate, repainting a car can cost anywhere from $300 to more than $20,000, depending on the vehicle size, paint type and finish. A typical paint job costs around $3,000. A class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Hyundai customers who say their paint peeled off prematurely. In response, some automakers have extended warranties and issued recalls. Hyundai announced a paint warranty extension for eight models, including 2017 and 2018 Elantras, Sonatas and Santa Fes. The coverage applies to peeling or bubbling white paint, especially around the hood, fenders and roof. Other drivers haven’t been as lucky. One Toyota Corolla owner told 10 Investigates that her dealership said the paint recall expired last year — even though her paint is now peeling off her car with just a spray from a garden hose. Read more: You don’t have to be a millionaire to gain access to this $1B private real estate fund. In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how Whether the issue is a manufacturer defect or not, there are steps car owners can take to help prevent paint damage before it gets worse. Parking in a garage or shaded area helps. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, bird droppings, tree sap and hail can speed up peeling and cracking. UV rays, in particular, cause paint to fade and break down over time. If your car’s paint starts to peel, don’t assume you're out of options. Attorney Charles Gallagher says a denied warranty claim isn’t necessarily the end of the road. He recommends asking the manufacturer for a warranty extension, especially if the issue stems from a known defect in the paint or its application. Automakers have their own processes for addressing paint complaints. Hyundai advises drivers to check their vehicle identification number (VIN) on the company’s website to see if they qualify for a paint warranty extension. Kia recommends starting with your local dealership, but if that doesn’t work, the company encourages contacting its customer care team directly. For now, many drivers are still trying to figure out what to do. “I’m 70 years old. I’ve owned cars since I was like 16 years old,” Rinkowitz said. “I’ve never had a car where the paint flaked off like that.” This tiny hot Costco item has skyrocketed 74% in price in under 2 years — but now the retail giant is restricting purchases. Here’s how to buy the coveted asset in bulk Robert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US — with millions of Americans going poor. But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

Christopher Rugaber Associated Press Published: June 25, 2025 at 5:23 PM Updated: June 26, 2025 at 3:02 PM Christopher Rugaber Associated Press WASHINGTON – While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. Recommended Videos “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Uber made a big change to how it prices trips. It might be the real secret to the company's turnaround.

Time Published: 2025-06-25T20:31:09Z
Full Content:
A new study suggests that Uber pulled off quite a feat — raising fares, lowering driver pay, and increasing profits — with a subtle change in pricing. The analysis, which is based on a trove of data from a single driver, offers some insight into a strategy that the researchers say explains the company's financial turnaround. In 2022, Uber moved away from a formula based largely on the length of a trip and started rolling out what it calls "upfront pricing," which gives a price to riders and potential earnings to drivers before they accept a trip. Behind the scenes, Uber's algorithms use a variety of factors, not just the length of the trip and demand, to determine rider prices and driver earnings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has touted upfront pricing's ability to offer specific prices based on the company's data and AI analysis. "Anyone can price based on time and distance," he said during a quarterly earnings call in late 2023. "We'll be able to price out that trip and match it to a particular driver based on a bigger dataset than anyone else in the world." These days, upfront pricing is standard in most parts of the US and many of Uber's international markets. The strategy may be the secret ingredient behind Uber's 300% stock rally over the past three years, a new study indicates. Upfront pricing has been "enabling the company to raise rider fares and cut driver pay on billions of rideshare trips, systematically, selectively, and opaquely," Len Sherman, an executive in residence and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the report released Monday. The study, which is based on about seven years of trip data from one driver, found that changes to fares and driver pay could vary by trip. Sherman's report said that Uber had come close to being a master of what economists call "price discrimination," or determining the exact maximum that riders are willing to pay — or the exact minimum that a driver is willing to accept — for a trip. The term doesn't refer to discrimination based on race, sex, or other personal characteristics, but rather discrimination based on a person's needs and desires in a particular situation. It's a concept that economists have talked about in introductory economics courses for decades, but it was largely theoretical, Sherman told Business Insider in an interview. "They cracked the nut," Sherman said. "They have the data and the algorithms and the machine learning to come closer to being able to do that than anyone else." Since implementing upfront pricing, Uber's stock price has risen nearly fourfold from a low of about 40% below its initial public offering price. In 2023, for the first time in its history, Uber reported an annual profit. The performance rally helped Khosrowshahi secure the option to buy about $130 million in additional Uber stock early last year, as part of an incentive plan. In a statement at the end of Sherman's report, Uber said its upfront pricing strategy was "designed it be transparent and fair for both riders and drivers." The company also said its pricing algorithms "do not use information about an individual rider or driver's personal characteristics." In a statement to BI, an Uber spokesperson called Sherman's findings "a tired, misleading story." When Uber first launched, the compensation model used a rate card, with pay based on the length of trips. Under upfront pricing, drivers' earnings have plummeted, even as the costs of working as a ride-hailing driver, such as gas and car maintenance, have increased, the study found. Many of Sherman's findings come from an analysis of one driver's trip data — information that Uber allows drivers to download. The information includes details about how much the driver got paid, how much Uber charged the rider, and how long each trip was. The worker whose data Sherman used was described as a "power driver." The study examined just under 25,000 trips that this driver completed while working close to full time for Uber between 2018 and February 2025. The driver saw pay cuts starting in September 2022, around the time Uber rolled out upfront pricing, the study found. Over the preceding two years, many drivers had seen their pay increase while driving during the pandemic, the report said. "We've seen this kind of narrative before — one driver's data and a lot of speculation spun into a sweeping indictment," an Uber spokesperson said. "The facts are simpler: upfront pricing is designed to increase clarity for both riders and drivers, not to manipulate them." If Uber can apply these methods to one driver, Sherman said, it has an incentive to do the same across a wide swath of its contractors. "The question, therefore, isn't whether our profiled driver is truly representative of all US drivers," Sherman wrote, "but rather, given Uber's massive profit improvement revealed by our analysis, why wouldn't Uber seek to exploit the same levers across its entire pool of over one million drivers in the US?" One Uber driver in New York state told BI he used to get more than 50% of fares when he drove for Uber. Since Uber introduced upfront pricing in his area, though, he has seen his cut — and, usually, his total pay from trips — fall, usually to less than 30% of the total fare. The driver shared screenshots and notes of payouts from his recent trips. The gap between what riders pay and what he makes becomes apparent when he strikes up conversations in his car. "They'll tell you that they paid Uber $60, and you're lucky if you get $20," the driver told BI. One of the clearest pieces of evidence for Uber's use of price discrimination came when Sherman compared his driver's rides from 2019 with those from 2024. In 2019, almost all of the driver's trips — 98% — had predictable pay based on distance, travel time, and any surge pricing that was in effect at the time. By 2024, though, that number had dropped to 77%, a sign that Uber had given itself "considerable wiggle room to maximize profits by adjusting prices and pay on every trip," Sherman wrote. The analysis focused on the driver's actual earnings and wasn't affected by fees, such as airport pickup fees, that drivers sometimes incur but Uber reimburses, Sherman said. Perhaps the biggest financial impact of Uber's upfront pricing, the study suggests, is on the percentage of each fare that the company claims — a metric known as "take rate." Uber doesn't regularly report its take rate in earnings. Sherman estimated it by comparing the rider price per mile in the data with the driver's pay. When upfront pricing began in 2022, the rides that Sherman's driver took had a take rate of about 32%. By the end of 2024, the take rate stood at about 42%. On some trips that Sherman examined, Uber took more than 50% of the fare. Sherman determined that the lack of transparency around pricing with the new model could have allowed Uber to increase take rates. How much Uber takes from each fare is a frequent topic of discussion for ride-hailing drivers and their passengers. "Drivers are obsessed with it," Sherman said. Determining how they're splitting a fare with Uber is an important factor for ride-hailing drivers who are deciding whether the job is worth it, said Sergio Avedian, an Uber driver who's a senior contributor to The Rideshare Guy, a gig driver advocacy blog and YouTube channel. "There is no other math," he said. Uber's upfront pricing also raised fares for short trips that the driver took, Sherman found. Longer trips, meanwhile, became a comparatively good deal for riders, which could have spurred riders to use Uber for longer trips instead of only quick hops around town, he said. "Uber's upfront pricing policy thus unlocked a trifecta of profit improvement: higher margins applied to higher-priced trips plus a shift to longer, more profitable trips," the report said.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo is seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia's stock hit a record high on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a "Golden Wave" of artificial intelligence. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose over 4 per cent to a record high of US$154.10. The rise sent Nvidia's stock market value to US$3.76 trillion, overtaking Microsoft, which was last valued at US$3.65 trillion following a 0.2 per cent increase in its stock. Fueling Nvidia's latest rally, Loop Capital lifted its price target for the designer of high-end AI processors to US$250 from US$175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand," Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah wrote in a client note.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. “I’m bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don’t know what will happen after that,” said Smith. “The stock doesn’t look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world. Ultimately the duration of Nvidia’s growth will depend on how long its customers increase their investments in AI. If they slow their spending, it won’t take much to see a big shift in volatility.” (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

If they slow their spending, it won’t take much to see a big shift in volatility.” (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls

Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company’s business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant’s stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia’s previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump’s election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump’s move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia’s shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia’s H20 chips – which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the “$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.” However, overall demand for Nvidia’s chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 – which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. “While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street’s main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia’s customers include the likes of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Wall Street is growing even more bullish on Microsoft (MSFT), whose shares set fresh all-time highs Wednesday. In a note to clients Tuesday, Wells Fargo raised its price target to $585 from $565, representing a 19% premium over Microsoft's closing level Tuesday of $490.11—which was itself a record. The climb continued today, as Microsoft shares hit a record intraday level of $494.56 and closed at $492.27. The finish marked the tech titan's 12th record close in 17 June trading sessions. "We acknowledge shares are trading near historical highs, but think this is justified given its early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market," Wells Fargo said, adding, "We still see a bright future ahead for Microsoft." Wedbush was even more bullish Wednesday, raising its price target to $600 from $515. Microsoft has "a massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep" as enterprise clients deploy AI tools, analysts wrote. Wells Fargo and Wedbush are more bullish than average, but they're far from alone. All 19 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for Microsoft stock, with a mean price target of about $532. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect closing prices.

Title: Netflix Should Invest in High-Value, Short-Form Content and Exclusive Creator Deals, Analyst Says
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-invest-short-form-video-content-creator-deals-wells-fargo-analyst/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T16:57:34Z

Wells Fargo’s Steve Cahall says move would add subscribers, drive engagement, boost ads and better compete with YouTube and social media As Netflix aspires to reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall believes that the company’s next big investment should be high-value, short-form content and exclusive, multi-year deals with creators. He sees short-form video content as a potential third pillar of growth, along with sports and ads, that will broaden the streamer’s engagement, deepen its library of content, help the company navigate generational changes as engagement grows on TikTok, social media and user generated feeds on YouTube, and make a $1 trillion market cap aspiration feel possible. “Some of the bigger creators on YouTube have high production value content with huge, built-in audiences. Their annual viewing hours rival big Netflix originals,” Cahall, who raised the bank’s price target on Netflix stock from $1,222 to $1,500 per share, wrote in a research note. “Moving creators exclusively to NFLX could be an opportunity to add subscribers, engagement and ads, all at an attractive ROI.” Wells Fargo estimates that Netflix paid an average of $81 per 1,000 hours viewed on content in 2024, with top originals making an average of $132 per 1,000 hours viewed. In comparison, Cahall believes the company could pay top creators an average of $60 per 1,000 hours viewed. While Netflix has recently moved into live programming, Cahall argued that type of appointment viewing will “always be limited for a mostly on-demand service.” He pointed out that Netflix’s ramp up of live and sports content has been “very piecemeal and will likely remain so” due to most major sports rights being locked up between now and the end of the decade. Cahall’s call for Netflix to push into short-form video content comes as YouTube lead TV viewing for the fourth consecutive month in May with a 12.5% share, while Netflix trailed behind in second with a share of 7.5%. “We think short-form premium content that has helped YouTube track ahead of NFLX in US TV time (and potentially time per user) presents a unique opportunity for nearer term growth,” he said. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has previously knocked YouTube, arguing that it’s in the “killing time” business as opposed to the “spending time” business. He added that YouTube is a good platform for creators to “cut your teeth on” or develop an idea that can then be brought to Netflix where they would assume the financial risk. While Netflix has been focused on capturing the share of TV watching that’s not on its platform nor YouTube, Sarandos has said the company is competing with the Alphabet-owned video platform for the chunk of viewing geared towards “professional content.” In order to reach its $1 trillion market cap goal, Netflix is looking to double its revenue to $78 billion and triple its operating income to around $30 billion by 2030. It’s also eyeing about 410 million subscribers and roughly $9 billion in global ad sales by 2030, according to figures leaked to the Wall Street Journal. Outside of its content, Netflix has expressed an interest in adding video podcasts to the platform. The company is also targeting a late 2025 opening for its Netflix Houses in Pennsylvania and Dallas, with a third location opening on the Las Vegas Strip in 2027, which will offer live immersive experiences based on its popular programming, a theater to watch movies and shows on the big screen, shopping and dining. Shares of Netflix have climbed 90% in the past year and 44% year to date.

The 10 models are the first to be added to CAIS's recently launched Models Marketplace and feature substantial exposure to private markets. June 25, 2025 Alternative investment platform CAIS unveiled the first investment models to be added to its recently launched CAIS Models Marketplace. The new line-up includes multi-asset model portfolios, three each from BlackRock, Carlyle and KKR, and one multi-asset, multi-manager model from Franklin Templeton. The announcement comes amid a boom in model portfolio adoption across the RIA universe. As financial advisors increasingly look for model portfolios with private market exposure, both asset managers and various investment platforms are rushing to meet the demand. For example, last week, wealth management platform Envestnet revealed it was adding models with private market exposure options from Fidelity, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. Last year, alternative investment platform iCapital launched its first model portfolio, with access to private equity, private credit and real assets. BlackRock’s models will combine exposure to public and private markets with allocations to public equities, public debt, private equity and private credit through select BlackRock investment vehicles. The assets in the model will run across the risk spectrum. Carlyle’s models will target private equity and private credit, focusing on enhanced returns, supplemental income and capital preservation. Related:Carlyle Makes New Retail Fund Push to Buy and Sell PE Stakes KKR’s models will allocate to private equity, private credit, private real estate and private infrastructure. They will also focus on generating income, enhanced returns and capital preservation. Franklin Templeton’s model will invest in private markets, including private credit, private real estate, infrastructure, secondaries, co-investments and asset-backed finance. These investment options will be accessed through Alternatives by Franklin Templeton and select third-party partners. “Alternative investment models give advisors a powerful tool to deliver more personalized portfolios, while helping to streamline operational complexity and scale allocations,” said Neil Blundell, chief investment officer at CAIS Advisors and head of investments at CAIS, in a statement. “By packaging multiple alternative investment strategies into a single, professionally designed solution, advisors can focus more on their clients and less on manager selection.” Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments.

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has passed its proof-of-concept phase. With over $20 billion in tokenized assets and institutional momentum from top-tier asset issuers such as Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, KKR and VanEck, among others, on-chain finance is no longer hypothetical. But the road ahead — powered by rapid infrastructure improvements and shifting market conditions — is where the real transformation begins. Here are the five key technological and five key market drivers shaping the next three years of tokenization: 1. Blockchain infrastructure maturityLayer 1s and layer 2s are scaling quickly, reducing fees and improving UX. Seamless wallet usage, account abstraction and lower gas costs will make holding tokenized assets frictionless for institutions and individuals alike. 2. Smart contract evolutionContracts are becoming safer, more composable and increasingly automated. Expect AI to assist in designing and auditing contracts that power yield, compliance and asset servicing — all with less manual oversight. 3. On-chain identity integrationWallet-linked KYC and decentralized identity protocols will streamline onboarding without sacrificing privacy, a critical breakthrough for institutional adoption and retail accessibility. 4. Institutional-grade custodyMPC wallets, recovery protocols and regulated custody options will resolve long-standing custody concerns — making tokenized assets truly investable at scale. 5. Regulated marketplaces & exchange integrationMore tokenized assets will trade on SEC-regulated ATS platforms and become available on-chain via compliant DEXs, driving liquidity and transparency across asset classes. 1. Regulatory clarityRegulators in the U.S., EU, and APAC are advancing frameworks for tokenized securities, stablecoins and DeFi. As clarity grows, so will institutional confidence. 2. Tokenized treasuries > stablecoinsTokenized T-bills (e.g. BUIDL, VBILL) are emerging as superior collateral and yield-bearing instruments — offering institutional-grade safety with better capital efficiency. 3. Stablecoins as global settlement layerWith $150B+ in circulation, stablecoins are evolving into programmable cash — enabling instant settlement, treasury funding and FX trades across blockchains. 4. Full asset class coveragePublic equities, private equity, bonds, credit, real estate and commodities are all heading on-chain. Tokenization is expanding from yield products to the full capital stack. 5. Institutional & emerging market accelerationWall Street is actively piloting tokenization infrastructure, while emerging markets are leapfrogging legacy systems by going directly to blockchain rails. Conclusion The next phase of RWA tokenization will be driven by scalability, composability and credibility. Institutions are no longer asking if they should tokenize — but how fast they can do it. The result will be a 24/7, globally accessible financial system — built on trustless rails, powered by programmable assets.

Title: Loop Capital: NVIDIA (NVDA) Heading To A $6 Trillion Valuation

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We noted in a recent post that NVIDIA appears to have vanquished nearly all of its near-term bearish catalysts, prompting some hedge fund managers based in Boston to ask the rhetorical question: what is keeping the stock from breaking out? Now, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has joined this bullish chorus by pegging a street-high price target of $250 on NVIDIA shares, which implies a market capitalization of $6 trillion! Baruah then cites the math that "just works" to justify his unbridled enthusiasm vis-à-vis NVIDIA. According to Loop Capital's supply chain analyst John Donovan, the spending on GPUs could climb to $2 trillion by 2028, which would be equivalent to between 50 and 60 percent of total installed compute capacity. For context, GPUs account for just 15 percent of the global compute capacity today. This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Bear in mind that NVIDIA has already disclosed that it earns between $40 billion and $50 billion in revenue from each GW of new AI infrastructure. According to UBS, assuming a conservative order pipeline of 20GW, this scenario would result in $1 trillion in revenue for NVIDIA. Coming back, Baruah believes that the upcoming next phase of NVIDIA's growth will be driven by hyperscalers, sovereign AI data centers, generative AI, and AI-based accelerated computing. Bear in mind that BofA's Vivek Arya is much more circumspect in his outlook for the overall AI market, expecting a global data center TAM of just around $1 trillion by 2030. As such, Loop Capital now expects NVIDIA to ship 6.5 million GPUs in the ongoing calendar year 2025, and 7.5 million in 2026, replete with an ASP of over $40,000. On the flip side, Baruah concedes the possibility that NVIDIA might realize these numbers and still not reach the stratospheric $6 trillion valuation, owing to a compression in its 30x P/E, which has been the norm for NVIDIA for the last 36 months or so. NVIDIA shares are up 3 percent at the time of writing and trading at the $152 price handle. So far this year, however, the stock is up just around 10 percent.

Title: SharpLink Gaming Boosts Crypto Treasury To 188,478 ETH, Becomes Largest Publicly Traded Ether Holder

Minneapolis-based sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming added over $30 million in ETH to its treasury between June 16 and June 20, cementing its position as the largest publicly traded holder of Ether globally. SharpLink acquired 12,207 ETH at an average price of $2,513, boosting its treasury holdings to 188,478 Ether, or approximately $470 million based on the crypto’s price at the time. To fund the purchase, SharpLink raised $27.7 million in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) offering, selling over 2.5 million shares. SharpLink is one of the increasing group of publicly traded companies that recently pivoted to add crypto to their corporate balance sheets, following the successful playbook of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Since the company is centered on Ethereum, it is the first Nasdaq-listed firm to adopt ETH as its core treasury reserve asset, aiming to offer shareholders exposure to the second-largest crypto by market cap. Unlike Strategy, which typically just accumulates BTC, SharpLink has put its ETH to work. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy, the company said it has staked all its crypto cache, earning 120 ETH in rewards. The firm also disclosed an ETH-per-share growth rate of roughly 19% during that period. “This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders, alike,” said SharpLink Chairman of the Board, Ethereum co-founder, and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin in a statement. ETH is up 0.5% over the past 24 hours amid a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. It is now trading at $2,419.38, which is below the average purchase price for SharpLink’s treasury buys. While SharpLink now claims the bragging right of being the biggest publicly traded holder of Ether globally, some entities are still holding more ETH. The Ethereum Foundation now holds 212,072 ETH ( valued at $514.59 million) in its treasury, data from Arkham Intelligence shows. Some crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, such as BlackRock, also hold a considerably bigger ETH stash, albeit on behalf of their clients. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF held roughly 1.7 million ETH as of June 25, worth around $4 billion.

Title: AMZN Stock To $400?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Amazon’s stock has already delivered impressive gains, rising over 150% from $85 levels in early 2023 to around $210 now. But what could propel the stock to double from current levels over the next few years? The answer lies in AWS and AI – the primary growth engine for Amazon. AWS remains Amazon’s most lucrative segment and the key catalyst for future stock appreciation. AWS revenue growth of 19% year-over-year in 2024 and 17% in Q1’25 was strong, and it is expected to remain in high teens in the near term. The artificial intelligence boom is driving accelerated demand for cloud computing services, with enterprises turning to AWS to leverage AI capabilities quickly. Separately, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Also, see – Should You Buy RKLB Stock At $33? Amazon is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure. In 2024, the company spent approximately $75 billion on capital expenditures, and CEO Andy Jassy expects this to exceed $100 billion in 2025. This substantial investment is largely driven by the increasing demands of generative AI. Recently, Amazon further underscored its commitment by announcing plans to invest $54 billion in the UK over the next three years. This investment aims to expand both its warehouse network and artificial intelligence infrastructure, bolstering its e-commerce and cloud operations. AWS revenue reached $108 billion in 2024, representing 17% of Amazon’s total revenues. However, the segment’s high margins establish it as Amazon’s primary profit driver. Continued double-digit growth in AWS could significantly increase the company’s overall valuation. For perspective, AWS alone accounted for an estimated 40% of Amazon’s total EBITDA in 2024. Wondering about Amazon’s profitability, check out – Amazon Operating Income Comparison and Amazon Operating Cash Flow Comparison Amazon’s AI investments create a multiplier effect across all business segments. In e-commerce, AI will help enhance recommendation engines, optimize logistics networks, and improve inventory management, driving higher conversion rates and operational efficiency. For advertising, AI will likely enable more precise targeting and dynamic pricing, increasing ad effectiveness and commanding premium rates. These cross-segment AI benefits compound revenue growth while reducing operational costs, creating a virtuous cycle of scaling revenues and expanding margins. Amazon's advertising business has become a significant revenue generator, hitting $56.2 billion in 2024, marking its first time exceeding $50 billion annually. This was a 20% increase year-over-year. The strong momentum continued into Q1 2025, with advertising revenue reaching $13.9 billion, a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Amazon's unique position as both a marketplace and a media platform gives its advertising business a significant advantage. The recent introduction of ads on Prime Video has expanded ad inventory, while the company's extensive e-commerce data offers powerful targeting capabilities for advertisers. While attention often focuses on AWS and advertising, Amazon's foundational e-commerce business remains a substantial revenue source. Last year, the online stores segment brought in $247 billion in annual revenue, accounting for 39% of Amazon's total business. This strong base provides consistent cash flow, enabling Amazon to fund growth investments in its higher-margin segments like AWS and advertising. For Amazon's stock to double, the company needs to show consistent growth across its key businesses. This growth will likely be fueled by AWS's AI-driven expansion, the rapid increase in advertising revenue, and the stability of its e-commerce operations. Key factors that could drive stock appreciation include AWS consistently growing above 20%, advertising revenue reaching $80-90 billion annually (expected within 2-3 years), and improved operating margins as AI investments start paying off. Amazon's substantial AI infrastructure investments strategically position it to capture a significant share of the emerging AI market. Looking at the numbers, we project Amazon’s revenues to exceed $900 billion in the next three years, with earnings nearly doubling from 2024 to over $10 per share. Currently, with AMZN stock trading around $210, it’s valued at approximately 39 times trailing earnings. If it maintains a similar valuation, the stock could surpass $400 within the next three years. Should investors assign an even higher multiple, it would imply more than a two-fold growth. Also see – Amazon’s Valuation Ratios Comparison Amazon’s diverse revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising offer multiple avenues for sustained growth. This revaluation, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides the basis for the stock to double, reflecting sustained revenue increases and a reassessment of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. Amazon's diversified revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising provide multiple pathways for sustained growth. If these segments continue their current trajectories, the stock could potentially double from here, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion as AI investments mature. The convergence of scaling revenues across all segments and improving profitability from AI-driven efficiencies could fuel significant investor optimism. As Amazon demonstrates its ability to monetize massive AI investments while maintaining market leadership, investors may assign premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology companies. This multiple expansion, combined with fundamental business growth, provides the mathematical foundation for the stock to double—requiring both sustained revenue increases and a revaluation of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. While Amazon’s pathway looks promising, several factors could hinder the stock from doubling. Intensifying competition in cloud computing from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, for example, could put pressure on AWS's margins and growth rates. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny over Amazon’s market dominance, especially in e-commerce and advertising, might lead to antitrust actions. These could limit expansion or even force business restructuring. Google and Meta are already facing the heat. The company's massive AI capital expenditures also carry execution risk; if these investments don't deliver expected returns or take too long to materialize, investor sentiment could turn negative. Additionally, economic downturns could reduce enterprise cloud spending and consumer e-commerce activity. Elevated interest rates could also make high-growth stocks like Amazon less appealing compared to fixed-income alternatives. Overall, investors willing to bet on Amazon should take into account these risks as well. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Agrochemical Giant Syngenta: Toxic Sustainability. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2025-06-25T13:28:25Z
Full Content:
Syngenta doesn’t sell sustainability. It sells the story of it. It’s one of the world’s largest agrochemical firms—born from the merger of Novartis and AstraZeneca’s agribusiness arms, now owned by ChemChina. It sells seeds, pesticides and promises. And increasingly, it sells itself as a climate solution. But this is not transformation. It’s rebranding. Syngenta’s model hasn’t changed. It still pushes chemical-intensive farming, proprietary hybrids and monoculture logic. What’s changed is the language: regenerative agriculture, climate smart, sustainable intensification. The poison is the same. Only the label is new. Take paraquat. A highly toxic herbicide linked to thousands of farmer poisonings and deaths across India. Banned in more than 50 countries. Still sold in India. Syngenta is one of its largest manufacturers. In 2020, India’s Ministry of Agriculture proposed banning paraquat, citing health risks and lack of antidote. But the ban never materialised. Industry lobbying, led in part by Syngenta and its affiliates, stalled the process. The company argued that paraquat was safe when used properly. Apparently, training, not prohibition, was the answer. The burden is shifted to the farmer. The chemical stays on the shelf. And the deaths continue. Syngenta now frames itself as a sustainability leader. Its corporate roadmap outlines four priorities: higher yields with lower impact, soil regeneration, rural prosperity and sustainable operations. It speaks of ‘regenerative agriculture’ and ‘nature-positive farming’. It partners with The Nature Conservancy and the World Economic Forum. But its core business remains unchanged. It still sells atrazine, banned in the EU. It still promotes hybrid seeds that require chemical support. It still pushes input-intensive models that degrade soil, reduce biodiversity and lock farmers into cycles of dependency. This is not regeneration. It’s reputation management. And it’s working. In India, Syngenta runs various corporate social responsibility programmes: rural market upgrades, solar electrification, youth training and water access. These projects are real. They improve lives. But they also serve a deeper function: to embed the company in rural communities, deflect criticism and secure social licence. A firm that sells paraquat also installs solar panels. A firm that promotes pesticide use also funds health camps. The contradiction is not resolved. It’s papered over. This is not corporate responsibility. It’s strategic philanthropy. And it’s expanding. The Green Revolution didn’t just change what farmers grew—it changed how they thought about farming. Syngenta’s model continues that legacy. It reframes farming as a chemical equation: inputs in, yields out. Syngenta’s ‘Good Growth Plan’ claims to train millions of farmers in sustainable practices. But these practices often revolve around safe pesticide use—not reducing dependency. The goal is not agroecology. It’s market expansion. And the state plays along. Syngenta partners with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) (India’s top body for agricultural research and education), state governments and international donors. It co-authors training manuals. It sits on advisory boards. It helps shape what counts as ‘best practice’. And it does so without scrutiny. It’s capture by invitation. And it narrows the future. Agroecological alternatives are framed as niche. Indigenous seeds are sidelined. Farmer-led innovation is ignored. The path forward is paved with proprietary inputs, digital compliance and climate branding. The farmer is told ‘adapt or be left behind’. Syngenta sells carbon credits, drought-tolerant hybrids and ‘climate-smart’ packages. It positions itself as part of a solution. But the solution looks a lot like the problem. The same firm that degrades soil now offers soil regeneration. The same firm that promotes monocultures now speaks of biodiversity. The same firm that lobbied against pesticide bans now funds sustainability summits. The future of food is being written by those who caused its crisis. Syngenta doesn’t just sell chemicals. It sells the idea that chemicals are inevitable. That farming without them is naïve. That sustainability means managing toxicity, not moving beyond it. But this is the enclosure of possibility—wrapped in the language of regeneration, delivered through partnerships and enforced by protocol. The agri biotech sector is engaged in a corporate hijack of agriculture while attempting to portray itself as being involved in some kind of service to humanity. A couple of years ago, Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald called for organic farming to be abandoned. He claimed rich countries had to increase their crop production—but organic farming led to lower yields. Fyrwald also called for gene editing to be at the heart of food policy in order to increase food production. He stated that people are starving due to organic agriculture. Writing on the GMWatch website, Jonathan Matthews responded by saying the conflict in Ukraine and food-related supply chain disruptions had emboldened Fyrwald’s scaremongering. In effect, Fyrwald’s comments reflected the industry’s determination to undermine the European Union’s Farm to Fork strategy, which aimed by 2030 not just to slash pesticide use by 50 per cent and fertiliser use by 20 per cent but to more than triple the percentage of EU farmland under organic management. Such goals represent an existential threat to the likes of Syngenta, which led to a carefully orchestrated attack on the EU strategy. Mathews quoted research that shows genetically engineered crops have no yield benefit and drive substantial increases in pesticide use. The newer and much-hyped gene-edited crops look set to do the same. Syngenta was among the corporations criticised by a 2017 UN report for “systematic denial of harms” and “unethical marketing tactics”. Selling highly hazardous pesticides is at the core of Syngenta’s business model. Fyrwald is far from an objective observer. He is compelled to promote corporate value capture, patents and market penetration while denigrating threats to profit margins. Bayer sells dependency, Amazon sells inevitability, Microsoft builds the stack, Gates builds the script, BlackRock governs through capital and so on. Each firm speaks a different dialect. But the grammar is the same. It is the grammar of control. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Joe Duffy will host his final edition of Liveline on Friday, bringing the curtain down on one of the most popular and influential tenures in Irish radio history. Since taking over from the late Marian Finucane as presenter in 1999, Duffy has turned RTÉ Radio 1’s afternoon phone-in show into a phenomenon. Under Duffy’s stewardship, Liveline – with its famous tagline, “Talk to Joe” – could be a safe space for deeply personal stories, a chaotic small claims court and a crusading platform for social justice. As he hangs up his mic on the show, these 10 memorable moments highlight Duffy’s inimitable style, as well as his knack for capturing the public mood. An early indication of Duffy’s ability to stir listeners to action came in January 2001. Helen, a mother of autistic twins, phoned the show “in pure desperation” to describe her dire living conditions: her Wicklow house had been left unfinished by a builder who had scarpered, despite having been paid £25,000. “It’s just a nightmare,” she said, recounting how she had to cook Christmas dinner in her garage. Duffy appealed for help, the show was duly inundated with offers from tradesmen, and 101 days later, Helen – real name Catherine Doyle – was hosting both Duffy and President Mary McAleese in her newly rebuilt home. The legend of the Liveline effect was born. In hindsight, Duffy’s first decade at Liveline was wilder and more sensationalist than in later years, never more so than during the 2007 on-air barney between crime journalist Paul Williams and criminal Alan Bradley. The temperature really spiked when Duffy took a call from John Daly, an inmate at Portlaoise Prison, who accused Williams of stirring up a feud between himself and fellow Finglas native Bradley. “I can’t stay long, I’m in a cell,” said an agitated Daly. “Get off the phone you f***ing liar.” The episode prompted a clampdown on mobile phones in Irish jails. But it had a grim coda: Daly was murdered a few months after being released from prison. One of Liveline’s enduring strengths has been as a consumer watchdog, calling out shoddy customer service or – in the case of Mark Townley – serial conmen. In June 2008, Duffy heard several complaints about a Dublin-based model agency approaching teenage girls with bogus promises of a spot on an Irish version of reality show America’s Next Top Model – for a fee, naturally. Bangor native Townley, the agency’s boss, phoned in and brazenly defended his scam, while Duffy picked apart his guest’s murky past, before delivering a dramatic coup de grace: “I’m putting it to you straight now, and you can take me to the High Court on this – you are the Mark Townley that has been banned from entering England and Wales for two years.” Townley never sued: in a tragicomic twist, he was later imprisoned in England for threatening to kill Prince Harry. In September 2008, with the Celtic Tiger faltering, Liveline was flooded with calls from people anxiously withdrawing their money from banks and placing it in supposedly safer post office accounts: a postmaster spoke of queues out the door. Duffy knew reassurances from banks were falling on deaf ears: “Look at Lehman Brothers, look at Enron, Rusnak and AIB – the issue is trust,” he said, modestly adding, “I know I sound like Jimmy Stewart in It’s a Wonderful Life.” Then finance minister Brian Lenihan was so worried about Duffy’s potential to cause a run on the banks that he phoned RTÉ’s director-general Cathal Goan to complain. Days later, however, Lenihan issued the fateful bank guarantee, thus heralding Ireland’s great economic crash – something Duffy cannot be blamed for. But the host displayed his occasionally preternatural facility for taking the public pulse; as he later remarked, “The punters knew the banks were dodgy before the politicians did.” Down the years, Duffy has had many heartbreaking conversations with people suffering from grave medical conditions, from cancer patient Susie Long in the months before her passing in 2007, to the late Charlie Bird’s revelation of his motor neuron disease diagnosis in 2021. But few interviews had the immense empirical impact of Duffy’s 2009 interview with screenwriter Frank Deasy. A friend of the host, Deasy candidly spoke of his agonising wait for a liver transplant, likening it to “being on death row”. It was a sadly prophetic description: Deasy died only days later, during an operation to transplant his liver. But the effect of his brave account was spectacular. Within days, 15,000 people had applied for organ donor cards, with surely life-saving results. Once Duffy has a target in his sights, he can be relentless. This was certainly the case in 2010, when the host spearheaded a campaign against head shops selling so-called “legal highs”. For days on end, Duffy heard from people whose family members had suffered terrible effects after consuming psychoactive substances from the 100 stores across the country. One caller, Paul Hodkinson, recounted how his brother Colm died after taking magic mushrooms in 2005. Duffy’s unremitting campaign whipped up emotions, though not always to edifying effect, with pickets placed on some shops. But the public pressure yielded action. The government clamped down on the sale of legal highs, leading in turn to the closure of most head shops. A decade later, Duffy commented: “Our campaign to close down head shops was our best achievement.” Arguably Duffy’s most significant achievement, however, is his uncompromising and compassionate coverage of clerical abuse in Ireland. Following the 2009 publication of the Ryan and Murphy reports into sexual abuse in Catholic-run institutions, Duffy provided a sympathetic space for survivors to share their stories in raw, unfiltered fashion. In other hands, the deluge of abusive experiences could have been numbing, but Duffy handled the issue sensitively, with callers testifying to the traumas endured by vulnerable people in the Church’s care. Taking just one example, a caller named Maureen later recalled the harsh regime she endured in a Magdalene laundry, as well as the harrowing fate of her older brother at Artane Industrial School: “He was rented out to a bank manager for weekends.” Duffy has revisited the subject regularly ever since, whether allowing survivors to furiously decry the inadequacy of the mother and baby homes report in 2021, or, the following year, hearing how schoolboys sexually assaulted by priests at Blackrock College in the 1970s were shamed into silence by their clerical abusers: “They make you feel so ashamed, so guilty, it’s actually frightening.” In allowing survivors to find their voice, Duffy helped reveal the truth about one of Ireland’s most shameful chapters. A proud son of Ballyfermot, Duffy has never hidden his Dublin roots, given to sentimentally reminiscing with older callers about the city in the rare auld times. Equally, however, he has fulminated against the capital’s less attractive side, be it antisocial behaviour, street crime or, during an unforgettable 2015 rant, the city itself. Duffy declared Dublin “dead”, with shuttered landmark stores replaced by pound shops and fast food joints. “Dublin city centre is turning into an unadulterated kip, and nobody is shouting stop.” The possibility of such cranky outbursts ensured Liveline remained appointment radio for many throughout Duffy’s tenure. At the height of the first Covid lockdown in April 2020, between his signature pandemic-era exhortations to “washyourhands”, Duffy brought much-needed gaiety to the nation by hosting a riotous discussion on the TV series Normal People, complete with the classic Liveline elements of sex and religion. The host first heard genteel-sounding caller Mary voice her displeasure at the sexually explicit scenes in the small screen adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel. “I imagine it was like something you would expect to see in a porno movie,” Mary ventured. “What would you see in a porno movie, Mary?” replied Duffy, deploying his trademark sigh. (Mary didn’t know.) [ Normal People: Putting Sally Rooney’s novel on the small screenOpens in new window ] From there on, proceedings grew more entertainingly fractious, as a devout Christian named Tommy started railing against “fornication”, “the teaching of promiscuity” and, most unfortunately, “sluts”. The derogatory terminology aside, the captive audience was treated to a vintage episode. He can be hammy, tetchy and mawkish, as well as empathetic and engaging, but if Duffy has one defining characteristic as a broadcaster, it’s his capacity to hit upon and tease out the urgent conversations bubbling under the surface of Irish life. This was evident in May 2021 when the host spoke to Sallyanne Brady, who described the multitude of distressing effects of menopause on her health. Despite the fact that half the population will face menopause, Brady said, there was a silence on the matter: “I want a voice for these women.” Duffy soon noted that “the calls are coming in thick and fast”, and over the next two weeks women phoned in to share their experiences of menopause. Not for the first time, Duffy put a previously taboo subject firmly on the public agenda. That a male presenter should facilitate such a necessary conversation on women’s health probably says something about Irish society; but equally, Duffy was always adept at tapping into his audience’s concerns. People talked to Joe, after all. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . .

Title: Remedy is in control

Time Published: 2025-06-25T12:38:15Z
Full Content:
Amid a bleak landscape, the studio behind Alan Wake has found a way to survive and grow, all while staying weird. In the quiet city of Espoo, a short drive west from Helsinki in Finland, is an unassuming building that’s home to one of the most confounding studios in games. Remedy Entertainment is known for getting weird. It started with the meta horror of Alan Wake, and has since expanded with Control, a game that turns a bureaucratic government office into a sinister and unsettling battleground. Their worlds merge the surreal and the mundane — which is not a bad description of Remedy itself. On the day I visited, the studio’s energy was relaxed and subdued — in true Finnish style, there are even multiple onsite saunas — and frankly a little boring, especially for a creative team known for the likes of the mind-bending Ashtray Maze or “Old Gods of Asgard” musical. But that contrast is also one of the keys to Remedy’s recent success. In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the video game industry has experienced studio closures, persistent layoffs, corporate meddling, and ill-fated games that were canceled soon after launch. Exceptions like Remedy have been rare. Over the past decade, the studio has been implementing a plan to help it compete with bigger, better-funded developers and publishers, steadily inching its way from a work-for-hire studio to one in charge of its own destiny. As the industry has shifted toward live-service hits like Fortnite and blockbusters like Grand Theft Auto, Remedy has taken big swings with ambitious and delightfully strange narrative titles. Now it’s trying to expand even further with its first multiplayer — and self-published — game in FBC: Firebreak. The stakes are high: it’s the perfect example of Remedy’s new way of working and a proof of concept for its larger, more expansive future. It’s also a strange experience, marrying the surreal tone of Control with co-op play that bucks the latest online gaming trends. But to hear it from the Finnish developer, it only gets to take swings like Firebreak because it nailed all of the boring stuff first. “We are this building,” explains creative director Mikael Kasurinen. “This is it; this is us. We aren’t owned by anybody else, and I think that realization brings that culture of taking more responsibility. There is nothing above us that will save the day if things go wrong. It’s all on us.” This wasn’t the case for much of the studio’s existence. Founded in 1995, Remedy’s first release was a combat racing game called Death Rally. A few years later, the studio garnered widespread acclaim with 2001’s Max Payne, a hard-boiled noir with action ripped out of a John Woo movie. After a sequel, Remedy expanded in new directions with the survival horror game Alan Wake and sci-fi game / TV show hybrid Quantum Break. Despite its modest success, though, the studio found itself stuck in a cycle of working from game to game. It didn’t own any of its creations — instead, they were the property of publishers like Rockstar and Microsoft — and, with the exception of the rapid 18-month development of Max Payne 2, Remedy was only putting out new games every five years or so. That half-decade cycle meant that if any game failed, so did the company. This put Remedy in a precarious position, and it’s something Tero Virtala realized right away when he took over as CEO in 2016. “At that point Remedy had been around for 20 years, and succeeded in relation to many criteria,” Virtala says. That included releasing several hit games and steadily growing in headcount. But Virtala says that “it didn’t feel like enough” to have such a talented team and only release one game every four or five years. While it’s typical for games to take years to build, only having one project at a time left the studio vulnerable in case any of them flopped. Virtala helped spearhead a new path for Remedy’s future built on two pillars: One was becoming a multi-project studio, so that it was less dependent on any single game. Second, Remedy also wanted ownership of its original creations and to eventually become its own publisher. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it.” A major part of making this work was ensuring that everyone in the studio bought in and understood the plan, not just management. It sounds like a controversial idea and runs counter to the way the industry typically works: whereas most studios operate with clear lines dividing creative and business, Virtala believed that empowering developers to understand the business side meant they’d be better able to make the right decisions on the creative end. “People are smart,” Virtala says of his employees, “and they are mature enough to understand that if you want to make creative, ambitious games, it’s not possible unless you have the financial basis, unless you are aligned with the technology, unless you have the people and the production plans are in order. We try to provide the teams with as much information as possible. And then the teams are in the best place to try to figure out what is the best creative path within these constraints.” And it seems that the creative side has bought in. Sam Lake has been with Remedy for nearly its entire 30-year existence, starting out as a writer on Death Rally. (He’s also the face of the original Max Payne — literally.) He now serves as creative director and is the lead writer behind all of Remedy’s major franchises. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it,” Lake says. “When you’re creating a game concept, there are a lot of decisions being made, and the more you understand about what these decisions affect, the better you are prepared to choose wisely.” The real turning point came with the launch of Control in 2019, the first game released under Virtala’s leadership. While the idea for the story and world had been kicking around in Lake’s head for some time, the actual development happened as Virtala was implementing broader studio changes. He pushed for more efficient processes and timelines, hoping to make games faster without sacrificing the quality level Remedy had become known for. “Those three years were transformative for Remedy,” Kasurinen says. He notes that this new development style meant planning much more in advance on Control, and viewing limitations around budgets and timelines as creative challenges “that forced us to reinvent many things in a good way.” When it came out, Control exemplified exactly what the studio wanted to be: it was developed in a comparatively brisk three years, was a brand-new property that the studio would (eventually) own outright, and was in development alongside another project in collaboration with Korean publisher Smilegate. Creatively, it also allowed the team to attempt a new kind of open-ended action game and it opened up new directions for the future. Control’s success allowed this plan to continue. Since then, Remedy has steadily expanded. Control was followed by a long-awaited sequel to Alan Wake, and the studio has grown to 380 people. It currently has four projects in development: a sequel to Control, remakes of the Max Payne games, an unannounced title, and its first multiplayer game, the recently launched Control spinoff FBC: Firebreak. With the exception of Max Payne, which is being published by Rockstar, all of its in-development games are self-published. Remedy now also holds the publishing rights for Alan Wake (the sequel was originally published by Epic Games), and has created its own connected universe, which unites the worlds of Alan Wake and Control. In 2024 it partnered with Annapurna Pictures to potentially expand this even further through film and TV adaptations. Branching out into new genres and mediums is a further attempt to grow Remedy’s capabilities — and to better insulate itself from the volatile whims of the games industry. Getting to this moment required some structural changes. Remedy now has multiple development teams, with staff shifting between them as needed, and it also has a unique setup with two creative directors in Lake and Kasurinen. Lake says that both of them want to be hands-on when they’re leading a new game, and so having two people in the role allows the creative side to always be involved in larger studio decisions, even in the midst of an intense development process. “When I was deep into Alan Wake 2, I wasn’t a part of attending weekly management meetings,” Lake says. “I just needed to focus on [the game]. But it’s really important that we have the creative side represented on the company level. So this arrangement gives us flexibility. We can represent each other.” Even still, the transition wasn’t always smooth. As Remedy attempted to grow into a multi-project studio, not all of its expansion attempts worked out. First, the studio partnered with Smilegate on a new iteration of the popular military shooter Crossfire. The idea was that Smilegate would make the multiplayer portion of the game, while Remedy would craft a single-player story mode, giving the studio a chance to make its first first-person shooter. But CrossfireX was poorly received upon release in 2022 — campaign mode included — and shut down a year later. Remedy also attempted to get into the world of free-to-play games through a partnership with Tencent, but the title — known as Project Vanguard — eventually shifted to a premium release, before finally being canceled before it was ever shown to the public. Virtala says that these setbacks were largely a result of pushing too far too fast. And in the case of Vanguard, the failure helped the studio realize that four games at a time was the sweet spot for what the company could manage. “We started to feel that we had a bit too many projects for our size of organization,” he explains. “We saw that if we had a bit more focus, it would help our other projects to succeed.” But those failures don’t mean Remedy is done trying new things. In fact, the studio’s first fully self-published game, FBC: Firebreak, is also one of its most surprising releases. It’s a multiplayer shooter, which might sound like an odd release from a studio known for single-player narratives. But as the studio looked to expand, multiplayer was one of the key areas the team wanted to explore. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences.” Firebreak is a relative baby step in that direction. It’s connected to a popular game the studio owns, and it was built by a small internal team. While regular updates are planned — including “major” releases in the fall and winter — Firebreak isn’t a live-service game on par with Fortnite or Call of Duty, designed to keep players coming back with ongoing events and daily activities. It’s a paid game meant explicitly to “respect the player’s time.” It’s also a way for the studio to expand its capabilities without stretching the team too far. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences,” says Mike Kayatta, game director on Firebreak. “I like to think that we know what we’re doing when it comes to these large, single-player story-driven games. This is how the studio built its reputation and what it’s good at. When you’re faced with saying, ‘Hey, we need to diversify the types of experiences we’re making,’ do you really just want to just make five more of these linear, story-driven games?” So far, Firebreak’s release hasn’t gone exactly to plan. It was greeted with mixed reviews from critics and players, many of whom complained that, while it maintains some of the weird and unsettling tone as Control, it’s held back by repetitive gameplay and a lack of Remedy-style narrative flourishes. But the studio seems intent on fixing things, recently posting an extensive list of patch notes and other upcoming changes that cover everything from the onboarding experience to the UI. “Several things have gone well,” the studio wrote. “Clearly, not everything has.” The success of a game like Firebreak is still critical for Remedy even under its multi-project structure. It’s a complex plan that has kept Virtala very busy over the last 10 years. In fact, when I spoke to him in an empty conference room at Remedy’s office, he was delayed because he had to prepare for the studio’s most recent financial report the next day. “Every single game is highly important for us,” Virtala says. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.” This feeling is only strengthened by the current realities of the gaming industry. It’s a space where even a well-funded EA studio can’t get a Black Panther game made, a Sony-backed multiplayer shooter in development for eight years, Concord, is quickly shuttered, and the likes of Netflix and Amazon are struggling to make headway despite huge investments. Remedy is currently in a good place, with a growing back catalog and multiple games in development, and while it has grown, it’s still a fraction of the size of most other studios making big-budget games, which often have headcounts in the thousands. While the last decade has been a big shift at Remedy, Lake describes his time at the studio as being filled with constant change, as the company steadily grew in terms of both staff and the scale of its projects. Even still, he believes that the current incarnation of the studio might be ideal for this multi-project structure, and says that he “would be surprised” if Remedy continued to grow significantly over the next few years. While many large studios are seemingly focused on perpetual growth, the team at Remedy is happy to be sustainable. “There were a couple of false starts trying to get there, but now it feels very much like we’re settled,” says Lake. “This is what Remedy is now.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. 8 Verge Score © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Title: Trump Is Saying ‘Don’t Mess with This’ Stock

The following content is sponsored by Monument Traders Alliance and written by Karim Rahemtulla, the head fundamental tactician at Monument Traders Alliance. Let’s be clear: Donald Trump isn’t known for backing individual companies. But if you know anything about him, you’d realize he’s an “America First” protectionist at heart. And the truth is, Trump’s latest trade war means he’ll need to protect American companies from costly tariffs. And there’s one emerging energy company he’s backing personally. It didn’t take long for me to understand why. You see, this energy group is tapping into two of the most important forces shaping Trump’s “America First” future. Those forces are: Over the past few years, the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has been everywhere. Tech stocks like NVIDIA have become a household name. ChatGPT is changing the way we gather and communicate information. Plus, America is in an arms race with China, with former President Joe Biden signing the CHIPS act in 2022 to boost domestic tech production from companies like Intel and Micron. But aside from AI, there’s another side to the story – energy. While AI is growing at a rapid rate, it’s starving for energy. A single AI model can consume as much electricity as 100 U.S. homes during its training phase – and it’s only going to get worse. Even Elon Musk has raised alarm as well – saying we’re headed for a massive shortfall in electricity production if we don’t act fast. It’s rare that two major market forces combine, but this is one of those pivotal moments. On one hand, you’ve got AI – the single biggest transformative technology of our lifetime. On the other hand, you’ve got energy – the main resource to fuel that transformation. Combine the two and you have a complete system for: When I was researching the company, I was shocked at how strong its fundamentals were: Here are a few reasons why the energy group is not a household name yet. It’s in a “boring” sector. Wall Street and retail investors have been obsessed with tech and AI over the past few years. Meanwhile, energy prices have been ignored unless prices spike. Energy companies aren’t sexy like Nvidia or Tesla. So, it’s overlooked because of its sector. COVID caused some impairments. It took some write-downs and impairments in previous years, especially during COVID when demand cratered. While the company is crushing it now, those past scars have scared investor sentiment. It recently partnered with an AI company. This company recently partnered with another tech giant to squeeze more energy out of the ground, and more profitably and efficiently. But that partnership is still in its early stages, and investors haven’t caught on yet. When a President starts defending a company in the headlines, it means something big is brewing. And when a foreign government recently tried to pass a new tax to interfere with the group’s operations overseas, Trump stepped in with a fiery statement – directly calling out the move and telling them to reverse course. The fundamentals on this company are also the strongest I’ve seen in years, and since most investors haven’t caught on yet, I believe it’s still undervalued right now.

Title: Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi rollout faced bumps in the road
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robotaxi-austin-waymo-google-video-elon-musk-uber-stock-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-25T11:33:01Z
Full Content:
Good morning. An American moved to France expecting the workplace dynamics to resemble those back home — they were wrong. For one, they had grown used to friendly yet professional office interactions with clear boundaries. Paris was different, they said. Workplace relationships felt far more personal. In today's big story, Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis were rolled out in Austin. What's on deck Markets: From interviewing past midnight to scrambling to sign an offer, a PE professional shared his stressful on-cycle recruitment experience. Tech: Apple pulled another ad. What's going on? Business: Homebuyers can't afford to ignore the fight between Zillow and Compass anymore. But first, there's a driver who won't judge your playlist. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There were some bumps in the road. After a decade of waiting, Tesla launched a limited self-driving car service in Austin. The first Tesla robotaxi rides were available on Sunday to a small group of invited users for a flat fee of $4.20 (surely not a coincidence). For now, the service is geofenced to avoid Austin's more challenging intersections. The cars came with a passenger already buckled in — a Tesla employee as a safety precaution. In footage seen by BI, there appeared to be no significant intervention from the supervisor. The vehicles did several things right, but the rollout wasn't without its hiccups. One video showed a passenger being driven across double yellow lines into the wrong lane, prompting a car behind to honk at it. During the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions. While the rollout used the current Tesla Model Y, sources told BI the company is building a modified version of the car for its robotaxi fleet. The project, internally referred to as "Halo," involves cars with self-cleaning cameras and extra protection for the cameras to prevent damage and debris, one insider said. The rollout came at a turbulent time for Musk. At the end of March, Tesla capped its worst quarter since 2022 amid protests at its showrooms. Then, earlier this month, Tesla stock plummeted more than 14% following a very embittered, very public falling out between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Competition is also fierce. Waymo has such cabs in several cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. They don't require human supervisors to be present, and their service range in Austin is about twice the size of Tesla's current operating limits. Their technology differs, too. Tesla relies on a set of cameras mounted on its vehicles, rather than expensive radar and lidar sensors used by Waymo. This is in part why Musk expects Tesla's purpose-built Cybercab to sell for less than $30,000. Waymo, meanwhile, retrofits existing vehicles with its technology, which can result in a list price as high as $70,000. Although the robotaxi arrived years later than promised, Tesla's rollout was a critical step for Musk's ambitions to make an Uber-like network of autonomous vehicles. The company's stock price leapt 8% when the markets opened on Monday, causing Musk's net worth to jump by $19 billion. 1. Inside private equity's recruiting nightmare. The industry's process for hiring junior talent is notoriously competitive and chaotic. One PE professional shared his recruiting experience with BI, detailing how he interviewed until 2:30 a.m. with one firm and hid in the bathroom to call headhunters during interviews with another. 2. More Fed officials are calling for rate cuts. Three top officials appear to be on the same page as President Donald Trump after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady last week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the central bank's patient approach in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday. Here's what the Fed officials are saying. 3. Tariff worries could soon make a comeback. July 9 is the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's tariffs. Markets are in relief mode now over Israel and Iran's ceasefire, but Morgan Stanley laid out three reasons why tariff anxiety could take center stage again. 1. How AI data centers are deepening the water crisis. Large AI data centers each guzzle up millions of gallons of fresh water a day — enough for tens of thousands of Americans. Despite drought deepening, a BI investigation found that Big Tech companies have put nearly half of these centers in the most water-stressed areas of the US. 2. Why does Apple keep pulling its ads? The iPhone maker used to be infamous for its ad campaigns, but now Apple is becoming more known for yanking them. Its latest ad vanished from YouTube and Apple's site a few days ago, and BI's Peter Kafka doesn't get why. 3. What we know about the mystery device from OpenAI and Jony Ive. Or rather, what it won't be. Tang Tan, cofounder of Ive's io, revealed in legal filings that the highly anticipated AI device doesn't go in your ear and isn't a wearable. 1. Homebuyers are caught in the middle of an ugly real-estate fistfight. Compass and Zillow have been trading blows over who gets to see the houses for sale in America and where buyers will have to go to find them. Everyday consumers can't afford to ignore it anymore, writes BI's James Rodriguez. 2. The vibes are rank in HR right now. Nonstop layoffs, RTO mandates, AI training demands, not to mention concerns over immigration raids in the workplace — it's all piling up on HR workers. They told BI about the parts of the job that are getting downright ugly. 3. Disney's tough June. The company laid off workers for the second time this month, this time in product and technology. The layoffs affected under 2% of the group, according to a person with direct knowledge. Fed Chair Jerome Powell presents semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee.

Title: BNY Eyes $3 Trillion Powerhouse With Northern Trust Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/25/bny-eyes-3-trillion-powerhouse-with-northern-trust-deal/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 6: In this photo illustration, the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation logo ... More is displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, showcasing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's real-time financial trends, stock price movements, market fluctuations, and developments in the global financial services and investment management sectors, on April 6, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) The custodial banking behemoth Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is considering a possible acquisition of Northern Trust, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. So, will a deal actually occur? Not at the moment. The CEOs of both companies have had discussions, but there has yet to be a formal proposal. A spokesperson for Northern Trust also stated that the company prefers to remain independent. However, should the two firms join forces, there are numerous potential advantages due to their significant presence in the asset-servicing arena; thus, the opportunity isn’t entirely closed, particularly if BNY presents a persuasive proposal. So why would this deal be advantageous for BNY? For BNY, the rationale is quite straightforward: larger scale, increased influence, and substantial cost efficiencies. Both companies provide comparable services such as asset protection, trade settlement, cash management, and wealth as well as asset management services. Merging with Northern Trust would produce an investment services powerhouse. BNY currently oversees $53 trillion in assets under custody, ranking as the world’s largest custodial bank. Collaborating with Northern Trust’s clientele and capabilities would significantly enhance the strength of the combined organization. The merged entity would control over $3 trillion in assets under management, enabling it to compete with asset-management titans like BlackRock and Vanguard. Additionally, there’s an efficiency component to consider. The merger could yield considerable cost synergies primarily through the consolidation of technological platforms, reducing overall workforce numbers, and minimizing redundant real estate holdings. Under the leadership of CEO Robin Vince, who has implemented a turnaround strategy that has boosted the company’s stock by almost 50% within the last year, BNY appears well-positioned to pursue this course. Furthermore, BNY’s financial performance has recently exceeded expectations. related: Is Neobank Chime Stock A Buy? Initially, Northern Trust must consent to a sale. After the initial report surfaced, the company asserted its commitment to remaining independent. Then there’s the matter of regulation. While the Trump administration is perceived as more welcoming to substantial mergers in the financial services sector, especially following the recent approval of the Discover-Capital One merger, BNY is recognized as a globally systemic bank, which may invite additional regulatory scrutiny. The leading positions of both companies in the custodian and asset servicing domains could also trigger antitrust issues. Shares of Bank of New York experienced a fall of about 2% during Monday’s trading session, suggesting that investors might not be entirely convinced about a potential deal. Investing in a singular stock involves inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 during the past 4 years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, demonstrating less volatility as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on how he shrugged off Trump’s accusations
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/25/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-on-how-he-shrugged-off-trumps-accusations/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T08:54:20Z
Full Content:
Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Every time I’ve seen Brian Moynihan over the years, whether it was at a press briefing after being called America’s worst big bank CEO early in his tenure or watching him get trashed by Donald Trump on stage at Davos, one word has come to mind: unflappable. Now in his 16th year as CEO of Bank of America, Moynihan plays the long game. In this week’s Leadership Next podcast, the man now considered to be one of America’s best big bank CEOs says he would have told his younger self to move faster at making change and to “stay strong, keep calm and carry on.” “I testified in Congress before I was CEO,” he says, “and was told by the head of a House investigation committee ‘there’s no way you should be CEO of this company.’ He didn’t think our company was any good or I was any good.” Flash forward a few years and that person was “a good colleague” on other issues. “I don’t hold grudges” quips Moynihan, “except as an Irish person for 100 years.” Growing up with seven siblings in Marietta, Ohio, Moynihan wanted to be a criminal lawyer like Perry Mason. Instead, he became a corporate lawyer for FleetBoston Financial, which merged with BofA in 2004. Tapped as CEO in 2010, Moynihan recently said he would like to stay until the stock price more than doubles to $100—which he seems confident about achieving in these volatile times. “You need to be willing to step in and lead in good times and bad times,” he says. “Some people wear that responsibility like a comfortable sweater and some people could never get into it.” As for that moment in Davos when Trump publicly accused him of refusing to do business with conservatives? “What you try to be is an energy giver, not an energy taker. So when you’re in a situation of pressure, how do you give people energy? By being calm and showing them a way to do something as a team and as a group that enables you to make progress.” That’s a quality he hires for, too: “You’re looking for people who can be calm at a point of attack,” he says. “When 210,000 team members look at you, they don’t want to see a person who’s going to panic. You may have nervous energy behind you or wonder in the middle of night, what the heck is going on? But if you show that and you let it eat at you, you can’t give energy.” You can listen to our full conversation on Apple, Spotify or YouTube.

There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friends,” he told reporters on Air Force One.

Leaked Pentagon report downplays Iran bombing The U.S. air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities did less damage than the president claimed and probably only set back their development by months, according to a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency. The report suggests that although the entrances to the underground bunkers were caved in the facilities inside remain intact. Trump used social media to insist that the sites were “obliterated.” Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, briefly broken yesterday, seems to be holding.

Title: Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.

Time Published: 2025-06-25T06:30:00Z
Full Content:
These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “TITAN1” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “TITAN2,” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

June 25, 2025 02:01 ET | Source: InfraPartners, LLC InfraPartners, LLC London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The research team unveils the new Upgradeable Data CenterTM in its first white paper London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 - InfraPartners, a leader in prefabricated AI data center solutions, today announced the launch of a new research function, InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering. Led by recent hire Bal Aujla, previously the Global Head of Innovation Labs at BlackRock, InfraPartners has assembled a team of experts based in Europe and the US to act as a go-to resource for AI innovation in the data center industry. The function will foster industry collaboration to provide forward-looking insights and thought leadership. Innovating the future of data centers AI demand is driving a surge in new global data center builds which are projected to triple by 2030. AI-specific infrastructure is expected to drive approximately 70% of this growth. Additionally, regulation, regionalization, and geopolitical shifts are reshaping infrastructure needs. As a result, operators are looking at new ways to meet these changes with solutions that deliver scale, schedule certainty, and accelerated time-to-value while improving sustainability and avoiding technology obsolescence. InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering will accelerate data center innovation by identifying and focusing on the biggest opportunities and challenges of this next wave of AI-driven growth. With plans for Gigawatts (GWs) of data center builds globally and projected investments reaching nearly $7 trillion, the impact of new innovation will be significant. Through partnerships with industry experts, regulators, and disruptive newcomers, the InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering team aims to foster a community where ideas and research can be shared to grow data center knowledge, capabilities, and opportunities. These efforts will aim to advance the digital infrastructure sector as a whole. “At InfraPartners, our new research function represents the deliberate convergence of expertise from across the AI and data center ecosystem. We’re bringing together professionals with diverse perspectives and backgrounds in artificial intelligence, data center architecture, power infrastructure, and capital allocation to address the evolving needs of AI and the significant value it can bring to the world” said Bal Aujla, Director, Head of Advanced Research and Engineering, InfraPartners. “This integrated team approach enables us to look at opportunities and challenges from end-to-end and across every layer of the stack. We’re no longer approaching digital infrastructure as a siloed engineering challenge. Instead, the new team will focus on the initiatives that have the most impact on transforming data center architecture and creating business value.” Ensuring access to the right insights As AI innovation and GPU roadmaps outpace traditional data center lifecycles and significantly change the design of sites, operators need access to insights and approaches which enable them to keep pace with rapid industry change. InfraPartners’ Advanced Research and Engineering team will support this by enabling the industry to build smarter, more adaptable infrastructure and improving outcomes for all stakeholders. A new approach to data center architecture: introducing the Upgradeable Data Center™ InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering has developed a new design philosophy that prioritizes flexibility, upgradeability, and rapid refresh cycles. Called the Upgradeable Data Center™, this design future-proofs data center investments and enables greater resilience and sustainability in a fast-changing digital landscape. “The Upgradeable Data Center™ reflects the fact data centers must now be built to evolve. In a world where GPU generations shift every 12–18 months and designs change significantly each time, it is no longer viable to build static infrastructure which has decade-long refresh cycles. Our design approach enables operators to deploy the latest GPUs and upgrade data center infrastructure in a seamless way” said Harqs Singh, Chief Technology Officer at InfraPartners. In its first white paper, ‘Data Centers Transforming at the pace of Technology change’, the team explores the rapid growth of AI workloads and its impact on digital infrastructure, including the thought-provoking GPU technology roadmap, increasing rack densities, and the implications for the modern data center. It highlights the economic risks and commercial opportunities emerging from these trends and introduces how the Upgradeable Data Center™ is enabling new data centers to transform at the pace of technology change. InfraPartners' model is to build 80% of the data center offsite and 20% onsite, helping address key industry challenges like skilled labor shortages and power constraints, whilst aligning infrastructure investment with business agility and long-term growth. About InfraPartners: InfraPartners is a global leader in digital infrastructure, delivering turnkey prefabricated data center solutions for AI workloads. The company’s standardized design process and offsite manufacturing offers greater schedule and cost certainty, plus rigorous quality control. With a core focus on sustainability and innovation, InfraPartners collaborates with hyperscalers, GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) providers, and government entities focused on sovereign AI to design and deploy scalable, energy-efficient data centers.

Title: Leaving Cert grinds industry: ‘Salaries scales for the top teachers can be 100 to 250 grand’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/06/25/leaving-cert-grinds-industry-salaries-for-the-top-teachers-are-100-to-250-grand/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
The final Leaving Cert exams are over – but another competition has been raging among grind schools where top teachers have been snapped for eye-watering salaries. The race is for a slice of a grinds industry estimated to be worth up to €60-80 million. Grinds360 is the newest competitor on the market, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. It describes itself as a “hybrid” service, combining an app which streams weekly grinds across 20 subjects, a Netflix-style catalogue of video lessons as well as in-person workshops at certain times of year. The cost, which has varied since its launch almost a year ago, is currently €1,399 a year. The company started out by poaching several teachers from rivals such as the Institute of Education and the smaller Dublin Academy of Education on huge salaries for the sector. The circumstances of one those cases – maths teacher Rob Browne, who left the Dublin Academy of Education to work for Grinds360 – was at the centre of a High Court row last September, which was subsequently struck out. Brendan Kavanagh, chairman and co-founder of Grinds360, says the firm started out hiring teachers from its competitors for key subjects like maths, English, Irish, sciences and business. The going rate to attract some of the top talen from its rivals initially was, he says, “anywhere from 100 to 250 grand”. “Are they worth 200 grand or 250 grand? For the hours they had to work – they were working six, seven days a week in day school and night school – I’d want that kind of money – especially for teaching!” Kavanagh laughs. At the online platform, he says, they are able to work fewer hours but play key roles in developing the future of the company. “It’s not really apples for apples. The more experienced grinds teachers are able to add a lot of value as we train other teachers throughout the country [who are now working for the company].” Some, he says, were also attracted by the idea of becoming involved in ownership of the firm. “If you earn that kind of money, you pay a lot of tax. So I think the opportunity for them to become stakeholders in the business ... created a new sort of environment there.” Subsequent teachers have been hired part-time, on different contracts, from various schools in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Roscommon. The result, he maintains, is that the company is making grinds “accessible and affordable” for students, while disrupting the “superstar teacher” narrative which he says has been pushed by some grind schools. “I’m off a few Christmas Card lists and I’ve been referred to as the Michael O’Leary of grinds. I’ll take it if making overpriced, over-glorified education finally compete on fairness, access, and transparency earns me that comparison,” he says. Nearly one year on from launch, Kavanagh says Grinds360 has seen “explosive growth” with more than 3,000 paying members and 18,000 app users. Backed by a €3.2 million seed round, he says the company is set to “double revenue” in 2025-2026 and claims the company has established itself as the “go-to alternative to traditional grind schools”. “The numbers speak for themselves – there’s a real hunger for a new model of academic support,” he says. Yet, business is also booming at the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street, which itself was a disruptive force in the education sector 57 years ago when it started the trend for exam-focused tuition. The institute was sold to a UK-based schools group, Dukes Education, in 2023 for just under €135 million. This year, the institute is forecasting a record enrolment of 1,700 full-time students in September across fourth, fifth and sixth year, with students paying annual fees of up to €11,000 a year. It also runs grinds, crash courses and online learning for up to 10,000 students attending other schools. Yvonne O’Toole says demand is growing not just for exam results but because students have “moved on” from single-sex, religious schools and uniforms by the time they are in senior cycle. While it lost some teachers to Grinds360, she says “crazy salaries” are not the norm, but that teachers are paid well on the basis that they are “expected to go above and beyond”. “They do a lot more hours ... there are extra classes – morning, evening – and they’re expected to be available. They put their heart and soul into it.” The institute’s main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It had about 350 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students last year and says it is on course to grow to 400 when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock in September. It expects numbers to grow to 500 in 2027 when it launches a fourth year offering. Founder Chris Lauder says while it also lost some teachers to Grinds360, it has “a deep squad” and was able to “march on”. The academy, he says, is always looking for top teaching talent. “What we used to do was ask our students if they knew of great teachers and surveyed them. Teachers also know other great teachers. And, these days, you also find them on social media,” he says. He questions whether some of the top salaries being mentioned are sustainable for the sector and insists the best teachers ultimately want to teach students in-person rather than online. “We pay more than what the public sector has to offer, and in some cases a lot more – maybe 50 per cent more,” he says. “Our teachers want to work for not just for remuneration; they like teaching students who are serious about academics. This is senior cycle only. They’re young adults, not children. They are driven – and they are a joy to teach.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Carl O'Brien is Education Editor of The Irish Times.

Title: Why did the US Army commission four technocrats as high-ranking military officers?

Full Content:
Four technocrats who are closely affiliated with Meta, Palantir, and OpenAI were just commissioned into the U.S. Army as lieutenant colonels, which I find to be extremely odd, and seriously concerning. Here’s the story, from a report at Task & Purpose: Four senior executives of tech giants like Meta and Palantir are being sworn into the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers at the unusually high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a new program to recruit private-sector experts to speed up tech adoption. For context, these Silicon Valley executives just skipped the entire enlisted rank structure (12 ascending positions), and four officer ranks, and jumped right to O-5. And, here are the four names: The Reserve’s new lieutenant colonels are Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer for Palantir; Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta; Kevin Weil, chief product officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former chief research officer for OpenAI. Since my mind immediately goes to scandal and conspiracy when I see the federal government cozying up to Big Tech (I’m engrossed in the news every day, can you blame me?), I quizzed a military friend trying to understand any reason why this might not be the nightmare it seems, wondering if I were overlooking or missing something. His conclusion was logical and simple: the only reason people are commissioned into the military is because they want to work within the military framework. I asked if it was because maybe their civilian status precludes them from being involved in sensitive tasks or missions? He replied no, noting that civilian consultants are a normal thing in the military, and then referenced Hillary Clinton who “never served a day in her life” but held a Top Secret SCI until very recently, when President Trump revoked it. And, these four men aren’t going to be officers in the traditional sense, as they’re exempt from standard military requirements: As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won’t need to complete the Army Fitness Test. So, why are top executives in Big Tech joining the military? Especially alarming is that all three tech firms, largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard, are known for being enemies to liberty and freedom. (I wrote on a disturbing development regarding Palantir here.) At least two of these technocrats are World Economic Forum elites—and now they’re leaders in our military? Is Sankar just a surrogate for Palantir’s Alex Karp? This doesn’t sit right with me at all. Image from Grok.

Total: 0.31 times (BSE data as at 3.54 pm) The credit growth of NBFCs which has trended above India’s GDP growth historically, is expected to continue to rise at a faster pace. NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network. Investors looking to invest can invest in the IPO for the long term. - Master Capital Services Ltd With scalable operations, granular customer acquisition, diversified funding, and expanding fee-based revenues, HDB is expected to sustain its growth momentum, outperform the sector, and continue delivering healthy, sustainable returns. We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months. SMIFS Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%. We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services. - Deven Choksey Research Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective. - BP WEALTH HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.28 times (BSE data as at 3.03 pm) HDBFS, a fast-growing subsidiary of HDFC Bank, is set for a ₹12,500cr IPO with a valuation of ~₹61,253cr at 3.9x P/B basis FY25 book value. Its strong presence in semi-urban and underbanked markets, diversified and expanding loan portfolio, advanced digital capabilities, and robust financial performance underscore its compelling long-term investment potential. - Aditya Birla Money Backed by strong parentage, AAA-rated credit profile, and an expanding footprint, A C Choksi Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. says HDB is positioned to leverage growth in underserved segments. However, challenges around rising NPAs, elevated credit costs, and subdued ROEs remain near-term watchpoints. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.24 times as at 2.21 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.24 times (BSE data as at 2.21 pm) Valuation: The company is valued at an FY25 P/B of 3.2x/3.4x at post\u0002issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively. The company is backed by strong parentage, brand, governance, risk management and a high credit rating. It is one of the largest NBFCs catering to the 2 nd largest customer franchise. The company is well placed to register healthy growth going ahead, while witnessing an improvement in the asset quality. SBI Securities recommend investors SUBSCRIBE to the issue at the cut-off price. At the upper end of the price band, HDB is valued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.01x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.72x. This places it above peers like L&amp;T Finance and Mahindra Finance, and in line with Sundaram Finance and Cholamandalam, but below the premium commanded by Bajaj Finance. - Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk • Further stake sale by parent HDFC Bank can be overhang on the stock price: The parent HDFC Bank may have to decrease its holding from 74.2% (post-issue @ UB) to less than 20% in a span of 2 years, according to the draft circular by the RBI, which was issued on 4th October 24. • Asset quality risk: The company’s Gross Stage 3 Loans accounted for 2.3% of the gross loans as of Mar’25, which may adversely affect the company’s financials in case of non-payment or default. • Unsecured loan risk: Unsecured loans accounted for 27.0% of the company’s gross loans as of Mar’25. • Liquidity risk: Any asset-liability mismatch may cause liquidity concerns affecting the results of operations and financial condition • Regulatory risk: The NBFC industry is highly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, and any adverse regulations or any failure to comply with a regulation may have an adverse impact on the business. - SBI Securities All IT stocks traded in green, led by Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Infosys. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. Among the defence index, Dynamatic Technologies and Cyient DLM traded with 1-3 per cent gains, while Data Patterns, GRSE, Paras Defence, BEL and Mazagon Dock depreciated 2-4 per cent.

HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.20 times as at 1.27 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.20 times (BSE data as at 1.27 pm) We believe HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in one of India’s leading and fastest-growing diversified NBFCs, with a well-balanced loan portfolio across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand. Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective. Mehta Equities HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.17 times (BSE data as at 12.42 pm) We compare HDB with Bajaj Finance and also with other vehicle, MSME, Consumer financiers like Chola, M&M Finance, Shriram Finance and L&T Finance. HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlook Nirmal Bang Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion? The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said. His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business. Report by Piyush Shukla of businessline | Read more HDB Financial Services, an IPO-bound NBFC, operates independently from HDFC Bank, with an upcoming IPO on June 25. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.14 times as at 12.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.14 times (BSE data as at 12.03 pm) HDB’s IPO crystallises three critical trends in Indian finance. First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps. Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come At upper price band, IPO is priced at 3.2x FY25 P/BV post capital raise (V/s its close peer Chola Fin-5.5x) with 2.2% ROA. We recommend SUBSCRIBE for long term. Key risk: Regulatory overhang on overlap of business activities with the parent. - IDBI Capital The ₹12,500 crore HDB Financial Services IPO marks a pivotal moment for India’s NBFC sector – not just as the largest NBFC debut to date, but as a test case for how public markets value diversified lenders in an era of tightening regulations and evolving credit demand. Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.12 times as at 11.36 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.12 times (BSE data as at 11.36 am) We recommend to subscribe this IPO with long term view, as With its robust brand, varied loan portfolio, and wide distribution network, the company which is supported by HDFC Bank offers a great chance. With a focus on digital infrastructure and underbanked segments, it is well-positioned for long-term growth. Considering the company’s constant growth in its headline numbers and the recent rate cut by the RBI will improve liquidity and reduces borrowing costs, which will benefits the company. - Kunvarji Wealth Solutions JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, IIFL Securities, Jefferies India, Morgan Stanley India Company, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Nuvama Wealth Management, and UBS Securities India are managing the company’s IPO. HDB Financial Services, a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, has garnered Rs 3,369 crore from anchor investors, according to an update on the exchange. The anchor round saw participation from a host of investors such as domestic mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign entities, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website on Tuesday. Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI MF, Nippon India MF, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, BlackRock, Royal Bank of Canada, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, APG Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, and Goldman Sachs have participated in the anchor round. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, British multinational Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, and Tata Investment Corporation, among others, have also been allotted shares in the anchor round. According to the circular, HDB Financial Services has allotted over 4.55 crore equity shares to 141 entities at Rs 740 per equity share, which is the upper end of the IPO price band, aggregating the transaction size to Rs 3,368.99 crore. Of the total equity share allocation to the anchor investors, the company has allocated nearly 1.94 crore shares to 22 domestic mutual funds that have applied for the public issue through 65 schemes, the circular said. PTI “HDB Financial Services Ltd. is India’s second largest and third-fastestgrowing NBFC franchise, serving 19.2 million customers as of March 31, 2025, with a CAGR of 25.45% over two years. Its growth is supported by financial inclusion initiatives, and it offers 13 lending products across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance, tailored by loan type, customer profile, tenure, and interest rate. They have built a pan-India hybrid presence, comprising over 1,771 physical branches across more than 1,170 towns and cities in 31 States and Union Territories as of March 31, 2025, supported by a digitally enabled distribution network through both in-house and third-party channels. They intend to further diversify their funding sources by expanding and strengthening their lender base, with the goal of optimising leverage and reducing the average cost of borrowings. At the upper price band, the company’s FY25 price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 3.7x, with a post-issue market capitalization of ₹6,13,879.4 million. Backed by the strong parentage of HDFC Bank, India’s second largest private bank by total assets, the company offers a well-diversified product portfolio with robust granularity, scale, and sound lending quality. We consider the IPO fairly valued and recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating.” Anand Rathi HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.08 times as at 10.48 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.08 times (BSE data as at 10.48 am) HDB Financial Limited IPO: We recommend a SUBSCRIBE rating to the issue, supported by: 1) A robust brand franchise and granular retail lending model, 2) A wide-reaching Omni-channel (phygital) distribution platform, and 3) Access to low-cost funding anchored by a AAA-rated credit profile. - Centrum Broking Sharekhan IPO report mentions, HDB Financial Services is valued at an FY25 price-to-book ratio of ~3.2x/~3.4x at post-issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively, which is reasonable as compared to its peers considering the growth and return ratio profile. “Strong parentage and much smaller in size as compared its core peer (Bajaj Finance) provides a long runway for growth. Additionally, favourable macro environment will act as tailwind for the sector in the near to medium term. We expect healthy listing gains and remain assertive from a medium to long-term perspective.” ❑ Asset Quality: High exposure to unsecured loans and MSMEs increases the risk of defaults, especially during economic stress. ❑ Geographic Concentration: Over 80% of branches are in semi-urban/rural areas, which may be more vulnerable to economic or monsoon-related disruptions. ❑ Liquidity & Interest Rate Risk: As an NBFC, HDB relies on borrowed funds. Tightening liquidity or rising interest rates could impact margins and loan growth. ❑ Regulatory Risk: RBI’s evolving norms for NBFCs could affect operations, compliance costs, and capital requirements. ❑ Competition: Intense competition from banks, fintechs, and other NBFCs may pressure yields and affect credit quality. ❑ Limited Transparency: Being unlisted, HDB provides less public disclosure than listed peers, limiting investor visibility HDB Financial Services IPO has been subscribed 0.04 times as at 10.18 am on June 25, its opening day. The NII portion has been booked 0.07 times, retail 0.05 times, employee portion 0.29 times and reserved for shareholders 0.07 times. QIBs were NIL. Influx Healthtech stock traded flat on NSE Emerge at ₹132.20 as at 10.11 am after listing at ₹132.50, a premium of 38% against the issue price of ₹96. Arisinfra Solutions stock rose 1.55% on the NSE to ₹208.18 as at 10.09 am after listing at ₹205, a 7.65% discount from the IPO price of ₹222. Valuation: HFSL is the seventh largest leading, diversified retail-focused NBFC in India in terms of the size of total gross loan. The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25. Additionally, the NIM has been under pressure and remains lower compared to peers. The declining ROE and PCR further underscore operational concerns. Although the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by its strong brand and expanding customer base, considering the near-term operational challenges, we recommend a “Subscribe For Long Term” rating for this issue -Choice Broking India’s largest NBFC public issue, HDB Financial Services, will hit the primary market today at a price band ₹700-740 a share.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs record $1B inflows in 15 trading days, hitting $4B for the first time

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.3 billion of gross inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the US crossed $4 billion in cumulative net inflows on June 23, only eleven months after their market debut. The products launched on July 23, 2024, and required 216 US trading sessions to accumulate their first $3 billion by May 30. Following the $3 billion mark, spot Ethereum ETFs added the next $1 billion in just 15 trading days, lifting lifetime net subscriptions to $4.01 billion by the close of June 23. Those 15 sessions represent 6.5% of the 231-day trading history but account for 25% of all cash committed so far. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.31 billion of gross inflows, while Fidelity’s FETH contributed $1.65 billion and Bitwise’s ETHW added $346 million. Grayscale’s legacy ETHE trust, which converted to an ETF at launch, recorded $4.28 billion in outflows over the same period. Daily flow data show the inflection. ETHA absorbed more than $160 million on June 11 alone, and the complex booked five separate days above $100 million between May 30 and June 23. Grayscale’s redemptions slowed during the same window, allowing aggregate flows to turn sharply higher. ETHA and FETH charge 0.25% management fees, matching the sector median and undercutting ETHE’s 2.5% rate. Lower costs, combined with established primary-market relationships, continue to steer inflows toward BlackRock and Fidelity, according to a CoinShares report that spoke with brokers who allocate on behalf of wealth managers. The report highlighted three factors as drivers for the June surge. The first is a rebound in ETH’s price relative to Bitcoin, coinciding with the Internal Revenue Service’s more explicit guidance on staking income within grantor-trust ETFs. Lastly, larger rebalancing orders from multi-asset allocators, treating ETH as a portfolio extension rather than a standalone speculative bet, contributed to the surge in inflows. The next quarterly Form 13F deadline in mid-July will reveal whether professional managers joined the late-spring push. Through March 31, those firms accounted for less than 33% of spot Ethereum ETF assets, suggesting room for broader institutional uptake even as retail flows concentrate on low-fee vehicles.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Coinbase Shares Soar; Oil and Defense Stocks Drop

Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, raising hopes for a more sustained drawdown in hostilities. Investors also kept an eye on Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell indicated that the central bank intends to maintain interest rates at their current levels until there is more clarity on tariff policy and its potential economic impact, despite the White House's calls for immediate rate cuts. The S&P 500 gained 1.1%, closing just beneath its record-high level set in February. The Dow was up 1.2%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4%. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., skyrocketed 12.1% on Tuesday to secure the S&P 500's top performance. Analysts at the research firm Benchmark lifted their price target on Coinbase stock, pointing to favorable legislative and regulatory developments and the company's initiatives to capitalize on them. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the department would launch a massive advertising campaign to encourage the use of wearable health devices. Kennedy specifically mentioned the benefits of glucose monitors for patients managing diabetes. Shares of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom (DXCM) surged 9.7%. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares jumped 7.5% as the ridesharing company debuted its robotaxi service in Atlanta. Uber's partnership with Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), initially offers service in 65 square miles of Atlanta, around half the city's footprint. Carnival Corporation (CCL) posted better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal first quarter, and the cruise operator's shares sailed 6.9% higher. The company also boosted its full-year profit outlook, pointing to increases in passengers carried and passenger cruise days as well as declining costs. Shares of competitors Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) also advanced. AutoZone (AZO) shares dropped 3.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, following reports that a senior vice president at the auto parts retailer had sold a stake in the company worth more than $2.5 million. Investors often view large sales by company insiders as a negative signal for a stock. Crude oil futures tumbled as optimism around de-escalation in the Middle East helped alleviate potential supply concerns. Shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (OXY) fell 3.3%, while Exxon Mobil shares (XOM) were down 3%. The potential for calming geopolitical tensions also pressured defense stocks. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares dropped 3.2%, while shares of aerospace and defense peers RTX Corp. (RTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) also traded lower.

Title: Stocks Near All-Time High as Oil Prices Tumble

US stocks climbed near their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel's war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% Tuesday and got back within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices fell roughly 6% and are below where they were before the Israel-Iran conflict began, the AP reports. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. President Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, says Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious. He said again in testimony delivered to Congress Tuesday that the Fed is "well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." But he did indicate the next move is likely to be a cut. Asked whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, "We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later—but I wouldn't want to point to a particular meeting."

On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after delivering a much stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it's seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000.

Title: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tanev Says Retail Investors Unfazed by Middle East Tensions, Still Heavy in AI, Crypto, Fintech and More

The CEO of the world’s biggest retail trading platform says that everyday investors are doubling down on their bets despite tensions in the Middle East and other geopolitical uncertainty. In a new interview on CNBC, Vlad Tenev says retail traders appear to be taking the recent uncertainty as an opportunity to continue buying the familiar names they had already accumulated in the past, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and crypto-related equities. “I was a little bit surprised that over the weekend, when all this was happening, the markets didn’t move so much in the overnight. I don’t know if you were surprised by that, but I feel like if this had happened a year or two years ago, we would have had a huge move, but markets were flat to even a little bit up. And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Besides the top ten biggest stocks, Tanev also says there’s been interest in stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), telehealth company Hims and Hers (HIMS), and oil futures. “There’s been a lot of interest in Circle (CRCL), I think that [Hims and Hers (HIMS)] had a big move yesterday – when you have a big move like that around news, you always have retail and institutional jumping in – so I wouldn’t say it’s just the top ten, there’s new things coming all the time, and now we have futures trading, so we did see some heightened activity around crude oil. But the futures traders have always been trading that, so I would say, broad-based equities and crypto, it’s pretty similar to how it was last week. High volumes, but no huge shifts as a result of the conflict.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The books world has been full of labor action in the last few years, most recently with Quirk Books voting to form a union with the NewsGuild and Abrams Books winning their vote to form a union with the UAW. Bookstores have especially been at the forefront of this push to organize. On May Day, I went to an event at Verso’s offices featuring unionized booksellers talking about their work and their organizing. One fact jumped out at me: over 40% of all bookstores in New York City are unionized, which is four times the nation average. That 40% is likely about to be even higher with the news that The Center for Fiction just won voluntary union recognition. How did bookstores in New York get to such a high union density? I spoke to five bookstore workers in NYC about their experiences organizing, how COVID changed the perceptions of their work, and how they find inspiration in each others’ struggles. Thanks to Aaron, Pilar, Henri, Joe, and Maritza for taking the time to talk to me. Their responses, which were so in depth and thoughtful, have been edited for length and clarity. Aaron Lascano, shop steward, writer, game designer, and Senior Bookseller at Barnes & Noble Union Square, RWDSU Maria Pilar Beddall, bookseller at Book Culture, with RWDSU Henri Seguin, bookseller at The Center for Fiction, RWDSU Joe Gross, poet and Lead Visual Merchandiser at The Strand, UAW Local 2179 Maritza Montañez, improviser and buyer at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn, RWDSU AARON: I wanted to organize a union at Barnes & Noble because every single one of my coworkers deserved to be treated and paid better … workers at other companies like Amazon and Starbucks had begun their own union campaigns to win better pay and working conditions. They showed us the path forward—the only way to regain power in the workplace and to bring your employer to the bargaining table is to unionize. HENRI: I had been asking around about a union because I came from Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. (Editor’s note: They started their own union!) Elliot Bay had this really wonderful structure they had started during COVID and fought for during that crazy time. So they were just total seasoned veterans of union work and the benefits that it brought to the space … So I came in [to The Center for Fiction] very eager and with some backgrounds in that work. And then getting into the Center, it was lot different than I expected. It’s not just a bookstore, it’s also a cafe, and it’s also a nonprofit. And so although it’s a small organization, I saw a lot of the same issues as at Elliott Bay … And then there was a big renegotiating of contracts at the end of the year. A lot of shuffling around that—you know, I can’t totally speak to everyone’s experience—but my own, I was told one thing and then didn’t get that in terms of pay … It was a big upset and we started discussing how to fix this, and how the Center can work in the long term, because it just didn’t feel, without the union, like it had longevity in the system. So we saw [the union] as a tonic to fix these structural issues. PILAR: We need unions, we have always needed unions, without them we have no real chance of a better, more just future. MARITZA: Most of my extended family has spent decades in physically demanding jobs, and many of their hardest jobs as migrant or seasonal farm workers offered the fewest protections. I took their stories to heart and cared about worker rights sort of implicitly. I didn’t anticipate organizing myself, but working in retail changed me a lot and made me more comfortable talking to people, including my coworkers. Eventually it became clear that we wanted similar things from our jobs, and that it would be safest to advocate for ourselves with formal union protections. JOE: In short, non-union life is no kind of life. AARON: I think I talked a lot about a union as stability. A union contract sets pay and certain policies clearly, meaning you’re no longer at the whims of management. You can bargain out policies to protect people in case of layoffs or store closure (which we did), you can bargain for more safety training and a clear banning policy (which we did). Without a union, we felt like bookselling wasn’t a job you could depend on for more than a year. JOE: We talked about precarity. We talked about being the lowest paid unionized booksellers in the city, which had become common knowledge inside and outside the shop as people who worked or applied to work at other shops filtered through. …We talked about how many of us worked two jobs or picked up freelance assignments to make ends meet. A bargaining committee member who wanted to continue working at The Strand but couldn’t afford to left the store early in negotiations and returned home—we talked about that. MARITZA: Our earliest conversations were casual in tone, validating, and a huge relief. One of my coworkers got a handful of BIPOC booksellers she trusted from both stores to join a Zoom after her last day at the store, and we essentially had a three-hour venting session as our first meeting. After that, our meetings got much more structured but it felt very much like we were looking out for one another and trying to make meetings as easy as possible to attend. PILAR: Because we need to! The threat of Bezos, and the more existential threats posed by capitalism and the government mean that the interests of booksellers and the literal work of book selling is more important than ever. And probably in the face of Trump and everything else, owners and bosses seem much less formidable. JOE: My longtime friend since elementary school, Aaron Lascano, was working at Barnes & Noble Union Square and helping to negotiate his bargaining unit’s first contract while I was assisting with Strand workers’ contract renegotiations, and of course we spoke to each other about our various victories and defeats until eventually we got members of our bargaining committees into a room together and began trading information. We showed up for each other’s rallies and pickets where we could, and RWDSU research…confirmed our suspicions that Strand workers were earning less than any other unionized booksellers in the city. The big takeaway from their reporting, though, was that upwards of 40% of all book shops in NYC were unionized, which is extremely high for any industry and opens a world of possibility in terms of contract alignment, the creation of industry-wide standards, and a base from which to organize related industries. AARON: I think that part of it has to do with the types of workers that bookstores draw. There are plenty of students working at my shop, but there are also a lot of working artists (writers, actors, etc.), as well as people who have previously held unionized jobs as mail carriers, truck drivers, and teachers … We also are kind of in a bookstore resurgence–in NYC, B&N is really coming back, but the smaller stores are seeing it too. So we’re working harder days, moving more product and talking to more people, and we’re not seeing our pay rise with the rise in sales and work unless we unionize. HENRI: Bookstores and the larger literary world is an industry of passion and personal interest. It’s very easy to gloss over a lot of issues because you’re sharing your love of literature, and of books, and you have a community of like-minded people around you. But the thing about COVID is that it really stripped us down to “oh, no, it’s a service industry job.” It’s minimum wage, you’re under the heel of a lot of pressures, and you don’t have a lot of agency when it came down to it… you’re doing something you love, but you’re not treated in a loving manner. MARITZA: It almost feels cliche to say, but I really do think the pandemic pushed a lot of people to act on their values. The economy and our industry shut down and stripped away some of the biggest perks that come with bookselling and left a lot of booksellers with just the toughest parts of our jobs. I think a lot of us had similar experiences: we lost the higher paying jobs and gigs that subsidized our low bookseller wages, and we either risked our health for low wages or got laid off by employers who received PPP loans. Many of my newer coworkers came from other industries that also got shaken up by the pandemic and were surprised by conditions so many booksellers accepted as industry standards, and that really reframed our expectations as well. JOE: And we read. Anyone who reads history knows the only reason any workers anywhere have any sort of rights is because past workers formed unions, and radical, militant ones at that. AARON: I was most surprised by how quickly people were willing to step up. Bargaining took about a year and half, and in that time, we had a lot of different people volunteer their time to help run the union. Even as new people got hired at B&N, they’d immediately get involved by coming to bargaining and making time to meet with the committee. Keeping any shop organized is difficult and time consuming, and it can only be done if workers step up to make it happen. JOE: Organizing tests whether you’ll show up for something that’s possible but not yet probable, and every one of my comrades did. MARITZA: I was anxious about talking to people who might think bookselling is too easy a job to organize, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many workers in other industries immediately understand that bookselling is worth unionizing. More and more people agree that workers benefit from unions regardless of what industry they work in. HENRI: It’s been really encouraging to see the different workers and my colleagues step up in really encouraging ways. You know someone through their function at work, but the union work has really broadened that perspective. I’ve seen my colleagues and now my friends stay up late,wake up super early, plan all sorts of sort of contingencies and write drafts letters. And to see that work was a reflection of our commitment to The Center and its mission, it just makes the workspace feel a lot more purpose driven and inviting. AARON: I’ve been inspired by the progress we’ve made as a unionized industry. In NYC, the RWDSU now covers B&N, McNally Jackson, Book Culture, and Greenlight. I’ve started organizing meetings with shop stewards from those stores and also Strand (covered by the UAW), so we can begin having conversations about building a new standard. I firmly believe that, if unions are to really make headway and regain power in this country, they need to provide a robust vision for working people. It can’t just be about raises, it has to be about reclaiming power, reclaiming dignity, reclaiming time from our jobs. And to get there, to really get contracts that can change people’s lives, unions have to link arms and act in concert with one another. We have to bargain together, picket together, and strike together. We have to re-learn what solidarity means and how to effectively perform solidarity. JOE: So many people showed up for us when our negotiations stalled and we went on strike: the patrons who boycotted the store, comrades from Alamo Drafthouse, Cinema Village, and Nitehawk Cinemas who are currently negotiating their own contracts, comrades from UAW Region 9A and UAWD, comrades from the RWDSU, and socialist elected officials from across the city including Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. I’m grateful, and I think people are realizing the existential importance of organizing outside traditional political structures, and unions are key to providing alternative avenues of engagement. Unions should not be siloed in singular shops. They are political vehicles, and the most obvious ones at that. MARITZA: It’s been inspiring to recognize that we’re part of a larger labor movement. The organizer who worked most closely with us at Greenlight also worked with Amazon workers in Bessemer, and that was humbling for me. I am sappy so the things that most inspire me are hearing my coworkers advocate for each other or praise each others’ work. I also love little and tangible things, like so many of my coworkers got new and long-overdue glasses after our first contract because the company agreed to a vision plan for part-timers, and that felt like a small but important and immediately actionable win. MARITZA: My advice is to do it! And more specifically: make space for your coworkers to talk. Not everyone is comfortable complaining about work, especially at work– give your coworkers a safe place to talk, maybe on Zoom or some bar where their complaints won’t be overheard by the wrong people at the wrong time. Then give people some grace while you find common ground. Very practically, I’d recommend researching similar workplaces that have unions and find a contact there to start walking you through what you need to do (and stress that you want to be discreet). If you’re in an industry that hasn’t historically had many unions, think about what the day-to-day of your work looks like, and see if there are parallels in another industry. AARON: Before I started my own journey, all I could think about was how much better my coworkers deserved. I knew that we could and would win this campaign, that we could and would improve our lives. But I didn’t anticipate how our campaign would ripple outwards. The militancy of the B&N campaign, which involved actions including delegations, practice pickets, and a couple of walkouts, made conditions more favorable for other union campaigns to push back against their bosses. We rallied and picketed with Strand, took note of the concessions their bosses made to them, and then the concessions our bosses made to us were noted by other bookstores that were re-negotiating their contracts. The work that we did at B&N Union Square, B&N Park Slope, B&N Upper West Side, Strand, etc., didn’t just improve our individual stores. It helped improve the lives of hundreds of workers around NYC. JOE: Talk about the shit that sucks. Don’t get any lofty ideas to start with; just complain to and commiserate with each other about every little and big way your job drains you and disrespects you and you’ll find that Baldwin quote about Dostoevsky proven true: your pain and heartache aren’t unprecedented in the history of the world and you share the path toward their alleviation. And never, under any circumstances, accept a tiered contract. PILAR: Do it, talk to each other, ask questions, reach out to members, and remember that no one has ever relinquished power willingly, even for things as small as better hours, or more holiday time. AARON: I am reading Roberto Bolaño’s Savage Detectives. I’m Latino, and I’ve been spending more time reading and thinking about Latino history, politics, and culture. I think Bolaño does an incredible job at capturing the fallout of American-backed coups and American imperialism in Latin America. PILAR: Jesus and John Wayne by Kristin Kobes Du Mez. JOE: Andrei Platonov’s Chevengur, which is a novel of ardent ennui that follows the forays of the October Revolution into the expanse of the Russian steppe and the people navigating that horizon, the space between the joining of a fight that was always going on whether they acknowledged it or not and the future they hope to win from it. MARITZA: I’m currently reading Miriam Toews’ A Truce That Is Not Peace and Oyinkan Braithwaite’s Cursed Daughters. HENRI: One that I adored is this very strange book called One or Two by H.D. Everett. It’s [published] by Mandylion Press who highlight lost feminist and female writers, and this book is about a woman who, in order to lose weight, exorcises her body, and then that exorcised clump of weight that she loses gains sentience and haunts her. And it’s also probably the most beautiful book binding I’ve seen in a long time. It’s an absolutely gorgeous little book. AARON: Solidarity is altruism, faith, strength … You engage this fight not knowing where it will go, not knowing that you’ll succeed, but knowing that you have a moral obligation to stand with fellow workers… it begins with the basic understanding that our fight is one fight, and that an injury to any worker is an injury to every worker. HENRI: For me, solidarity is just very simply showing up when things get hard. Especially just across the nation, there’s been a lot of examples of moments where showing up is the hardest thing to do, but it is the most important thing. And I’ve seen it at The Center, which is really wonderful. I’ve seen workers who are at their limits reach out for help and people lift them up… it’s kind of banal, but I think at its core it’s just showing up when it’s hard. JOE: Solidarity is a full and complete commitment to causes that nominally are not your own because you realize that every human cause is of mortal importance when you live in the same time and space and can only affect a real reduction in suffering by collectively exerting the power of all peoples. Either everyone has unalienable rights or no one does. MARITZA: For me, solidarity means mutual support, a willingness to take risks for one another and protect one another, and a feeling of investment in each other’s well-being. PILAR: Solidarity means remembering that we are not alone in the struggle, that victories have been won before and will be won again, as long as we fight together.

Title: Principal of school in Blackrock, Dublin, given further 16 months for indecent assault charges

Time Published: 2025-06-24T17:20:00Z
Full Content:
A former school principal jailed for indecently assaulting two students has been told he will spend a further 16 months in prison for indecently assaulting another four boys. Aidan Clohessy (85) was jailed for four years on Monday for indecently assaulting two boys in the 1980s. He was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault in relation to six boys following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. On Tuesday, Judge Martin Nolan imposed sentence in relation to the second trial, in which Clohessy was convicted of five counts of indecently assaulting four boys. Two of these counts of indecent assault related to one boy, with one count each in relation to the other three boys. All of these offences took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. After hearing facts on Monday, Judge Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence and the defence’s submission in relation to the totality principle. Judge Nolan said the indecent assaults were “undoubtedly very serious” for the injured parties, noting that many of the incidents described were “obviously physical chastisement as well”. He said the aggravating features included that Clohessy was in a position of trust which he betrayed. The judge also noted that the injured parties were vulnerable and said Clohessy “took advantage of their vulnerability”. He said there was some “small mitigation”, including Clohessy’s age. Judge Nolan said if this was a stand-alone trial, and Clohessy was younger, he would impose a sentence of between three and four years. But, the judge said the court had to take into account the totality principle and that Clohessy is already serving a sentence. He imposed a 16-month sentence, which is to run consecutive to the four-year sentence imposed on Monday. This means Clohessy has received a sentence of five years and four months for his offending against the six injured parties. A member of the Order of St John of God, Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co Dublin, from the early 1970s until 1993, when he was appointed to lead a mission in Malawi. Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co Dublin, voluntarily returned to Ireland in 2013. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disability at that time. The injured parties were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. The court heard that some of the complainants had no objection to being identified.

(“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

June 24, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: E Ink E Ink BILLERICA, Mass., June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- E Ink (8069.TW) the originator, pioneer, and global commercial leader in electronic paper (ePaper) technology, today announced, in collaboration with Oricom Co., Ltd., a vanguard in the Japan ad agency scene, the next-generation advertising medium via the Sustainable Board. Featuring E Ink’s most vivid color ePaper, Spectra TM 6, Oricom will produce the Sustainable Board as a new channel for advertisers, offering an unprecedented, environmentally conscious advertising method. The product is an innovative, sustainability-dedicated medium for companies using Oricom’s brand, Mirapale. While being conscious of energy consumption, it actively communicates sustainable priorities and initiatives. Sustainable Board is ultra-low-power digital signage that uses E Ink’s ePaper technology. E Ink’s Spectra 6 offers a wide viewing angle similar to paper and enables vivid color expression like a print-quality poster. Because it’s a reflective display that doesn’t use a backlight, it achieves especially high sunlight readability. Additionally, it only requires power when content is updated, and image content remains visible once displayed without consuming any energy. This allows for substantial energy savings compared to conventional displays. Moreover, signage products equipped with E Ink’s ePaper, which boasts these features, can operate on batteries or renewable energy sources like solar. This makes it possible to choose their installation locations with more flexibility and mobility in mind. “We are very grateful to collaborate with Oricom, a leader in the advertising industry, in the electronic paper signage area,” said JM Hung, Vice President of Business Center at E Ink. “As we enter an era of global environmental preservation and environmentally conscious solutions are increasingly sought, our ePaper is a display technology that aligns with a more environmentally-friendly future. Through our collaboration with Oricom, we are confident we can contribute to advancing SDG activities in society.” Expected installation sites range from company receptions, lobbies, and showrooms to commercial facilities and tourist destinations. This product is recognized as a novel method that aligns corporate branding with environmental responsiveness by making sustainability tangible. Providing sustainable advertising mediums will generate a new market in the advertising industry. Oricom intends to promote broader Sustainable Development Goals by enabling companies and local governments to leverage this environmentally conscious advertising platform. “Amidst the expansion of corporate activities with a long-term vision, prioritizing environmental protection and social responsibility, advertising is similarly called upon to contribute from this perspective,” said Akemi Nakajima, President of Oricom. “We developed the Sustainable Board alongside E Ink as a specific method for this. Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen the relationship between both companies, supporting corporate growth while contributing to realizing a sustainable society.” E Ink’s ePaper draws power only when the screen updates, and no energy-hungry backlight is required. This ultra-efficient, non-emissive design reduces both electricity use and carbon footprint versus paper or LCDs. Guided by its PESG (Product, Environment, Social, and Governance) framework, E Ink delivers low-carbon solutions that speed the world’s sustainable transition. FTSE Russell classifies 99.9 % of the company’s revenue as green, and Moody’s has confirmed E Ink’s loans align with global Green Loan Principles—clear proof of its industry-leading environmental performance. Installation trials at major stations in Japan are underway for Sustainable Board. The future goal is to expand into places with high advertising needs, such as commercial facilities. About E InkE Ink Holdings Inc. (8069.TWO), based on technology from MIT's Media Lab, provides an ideal display medium for applications spanning eReaders and eNotes, retail, home, hospital, transportation, logistics, and more, enabling customers to put displays in locations previously impossible. E Ink's electrophoretic display products make it the worldwide leader for ePaper. Its low power displays enable customers to reach their sustainability goals, and E Ink has pledged using 100% renewable energy in 2030 and reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2040. E Ink has been recognized for their efforts by receiving, validation from Science-Based Targets (SBTi) and is listed in both the DJSI World and DJSI Emerging Indexes. Listed in Taiwan's Taipei Exchange (TPEx) and the Luxembourg market, E Ink Holdings is now the world's largest supplier of ePaper displays. For more information please visit www.eink.com. E Ink.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and other semiconductor companies surged Tuesday, amid broader market gains as investors welcomed news of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. AMD stock was up 5% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Broadcom added 4%. Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) were also among the other chip stocks on the rise, boosting the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) over 3%. Micron Technology (MU) climbed 4% higher a day ahead of its quarterly results. On Monday, Melius analysts reportedly said AMD stock “has a lot more to go” as the company’s position in the artificial intelligence industry grows. The broker raised its price target to $175 from $110, above the Wall Street consensus of roughly $124 compiled by Visible Alpha. Broadcom stock meanwhile got an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at HSBC Tuesday. The bank raised its price target to $400 from $240, placing it well above the Street consensus of $294. The chipmaker's application-specific integrated circuit business has the "potential to knock our socks off," HSBC said.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: High tariffs give Trump less room for error in Iran | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The US economy needs the fragile ceasefire President Donald Trump brokered in the Middle East to hold. If the pause in fighting between Israel and Iran fails and major hostilities resume, oil prices would likely spike again. And surging gasoline prices are the last thing the US economy needs right now. Inflation is already expected to heat up this summer because of Trump’s massive tariffs on imports. An oil shock would make matters worse — perhaps much worse. “It would be a bit of a double-whammy. First there’s the stagflationary shock from tariffs. And then a potential oil shock,” Alan Blinder, economics professor at Princeton University and a former top Federal Reserve official, told CNN in a phone interview. In many ways, Trump’s trade war gives him less margin for error in the Middle East. He can’t afford another world event that causes inflation to rear its ugly head again and further delays rate cuts from the Fed. “The economy is vulnerable to anything that could go wrong, and this certainly qualifies,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That’s why investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief in recent days. Stocks have popped and oil prices have plunged in one of the biggest sell-offs in years. Iran’s response to US strikes on nuclear sites was far more limited, and symbolic, than feared. Not only that, but the ceasefire between Israel and Iran eases fears that vital energy infrastructure in the region will get caught in the crossfire. The nightmare scenario had been that Iran would try to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Analysts have warned that if this waterway shut down, oil prices could easily spike beyond $100 or $120 a barrel, causing a return of $4 to $4.50 gas in the US. As of Sunday, the odds of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz spiked to about 60% on prediction platform Polymarket. But by Tuesday, the odds plunged to just 17% as investors bet the worst in the Israel-Iran crisis may be over. Observers have noted that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be counterproductive for Iran, which relies on the waterway to get its own oil to customers, mostly in China. “They would be shooting themselves in the foot,” Blinder said, “but countries have been known to do that.” Critics of Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs warn that they will backfire, too. However, inflation has cooled in recent months even as Trump has lobbed tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and imports from most countries. Yet many economists say this is the calm before the storm, with tariff-fueled price hikes on the way. Some items exposed to tariffs like appliances, toys and electronics have already become more expensive. “In many ways, the past few months may be transitory low inflation before the price effect of tariffs hit,” Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, told CNN in a phone interview. “No serious economist would look at inflationary trends and forecast they will exist into the future.” Unless tariffs get dramatically scaled back, Elliott said inflation is likely to heat up by 1% to 1.5% from current levels. “That’s not going to be acceptable for the Fed,” said Elliott. In testimony before Congress Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance, telling lawmakers: “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” If the situation in the Middle East does turn south again, it would create a potential boost to energy prices. “It would be a tricky combination,” said Elliott, a former executive at hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates. Oil shocks can be very inflationary because energy prices feed in to many parts of the US economy. Not only that, but there can be a psychological effect given how closely Americans follow gas prices. And it’s only been three years since gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation skyrocketed to four-decade highs and the Fed was forced to put the fire out by dramatically lifting borrowing costs. “People look at prices at the pump as a litmus test for inflation broadly,” said Zandi, the Moody’s economist. For now, gas prices appear to have stabilized. The national average price of regular gas was flat at $3.22 a gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA. That’s up from $3.13 a gallon when Israel attacked Iran earlier this month. However, it’s still lower than $3.45 a gallon a year ago. In a speech on Tuesday, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted oil prices “bear watching” given the recent price swings from geopolitical events. “The pain of large increases in energy prices still weighs on consumer spending,” Hammack said, while noting that the US is less exposed to oil shocks than in the past. “Recent increases in oil prices pose an upside risk to the stability of inflation expectations.” The scars of $5 gasoline in 2022 loom large. For now, investors are hoping the ceasefire in the Middle East means there won’t be a repeat today. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

Global liquidity and BTC’s resilience could fuel continued uptrend. Bitcoin [BTC] continued to show resilience as Global Liquidity climbed to $140 trillion, nearly reclaiming all-time highs. The move came as the U.S. dollar weakened, and the MOVE Index dipped, boosting overall liquidity in risk markets. This uptick was not random—weekly liquidity grew by $0.46 trillion, a 0.33% increase, as confirmed by Alpha Extract. That surge helped reinforce the current macro support for Bitcoin’s bullish bias. The 3-month Rate of Change (RoC) stayed elevated, backing the thesis that Bitcoin’s $78,000 breakout wasn’t just noise. Historically, a rising 3-month RoC aligns with bull market territory and risk-on appetite. In fact, the RoC’s trend has been consistent since the initial breakout and continues to support the uptrend even as geopolitical risks shift. Source: Alpha Extract Due to the de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and Iran, fear-related volatility was diminished. Oddly enough, a direct war could have spurred liquidity via emergency spending. However, markets now lean toward reduced uncertainty, favoring slow-and-steady growth over chaos. This lowered volatility backdrop is ideal for assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on confidence and consistent capital flows. Following the powerful resilience exhibited by Bitcoin, the whale activity and institutional inflows increased. A whale made a withdrawal of 163 BTC from Binance worth $17.16 million, but this was just a part of a bigger transfer. The same whale withdrew 2,263 BTC, or $235.02 million in total. Of that, 2,100 BTC was sent straight to cold storage. In fact, it was this vigorous hoarding that indicated an increase in the confidence of Bitcoin as a long-term trend and a determined course in self-custody. Moreover, according to Trader to The Fund’s latest ETF flow data, Bitcoin ETFs saw $350.48 million in Net Inflows, marking the 10th straight day of green. BlackRock was on top with IBIT raising a total of $217.65 million, and Fidelity followed with $105.66 million Source: Trader to The Fund/X Healthy participation was found even in smaller funds. Even though Grayscale had a small outflow amount of $5.69 million, mini funds had a positive $10.06 million gain. Overall, the sustained demand from both majors and minors confirms that institutional appetite remains firm in this liquidity-rich phase. On the 15-minute chart, BTC jumped past $105,000, liquidating short positions en masse. A strong bullish candle supported a high-paced move of the price up to $105,112, after initially standing at a distance of $103,697. Meanwhile, CVD dropped to -10.438K, confirming that aggressive short-selling failed to hold the line. At the same time, Open Interest (OI) fell to 289.18K from 290.84K. This indicated liquidation of short positions rather than fresh long entries—a classic wipeout as bears got squeezed. Source: TradingView As OI declined while prices continued rising, it became clear that short positions were being liquidated in real time, fueling even more momentum for the ongoing bull market.

Title: Oil prices tumble, and Wall Street nears its record in a worldwide rally for stocks
URL: https://www.wftv.com/news/us-stocks-near-their/PKNRY2KTCRCSFLSLUSUDCRJWMA/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T15:00:05Z

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — U.S. stocks rose toward their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel’s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, following up on big gains for stocks across Europe and Asia, after President Donald Trump said late Monday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a "complete and total ceasefire." The main measure of Wall Street's health is back within 0.8% of its record set in February after falling roughly 20% below during the spring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 507 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.4%. The strongest action was again in the oil market, where a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6% to settle at $64.37. Brent crude, the international standard, had a similar drop. The fear throughout the Israel-Iran conflict has been that it could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would pump up prices for gasoline and hurt the global economy. Iran is a major producer of crude, and it could also try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world's daily oil needs passes on ships. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." Oil prices have dropped so much in the last two days that they’re below where they were before the fighting began nearly two weeks ago. With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Wall Street loves lower rates because they boost the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money to buy a car or build a factory. But they could also give inflation more fuel. That threat is why the Fed has been hesitant to cut rates this year after lowering them through the end of last year. The Fed has said repeatedly that it wants to wait and see how much Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation before committing to its next move. So far, the economy seems to be holding up OK, though a report on confidence among U.S. consumers came in weaker than economists expected on Tuesday, and inflation has remained only a bit above the Fed's 2% target. Trump has been pushing loudly for more cuts to rates. And two of his appointees to the Fed have said recently they may consider cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next meeting next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains more cautious, though he he did indicate Tuesday that the Fed's next move is likely to be a cut. Asked during testimony before a Congressional committee whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, “We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later – but I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” That helped Treasury yields ease in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.34% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.81% from 3.84%. On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after the cruise operator delivered a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it’s seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000. All told, the S&P 500 rose 67.01 points to 6,092.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 507.24 to 43,089.02, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 281.56 to 19,912.53. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied at least 1% everywhere from France to Germany to Japan following the announcement of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Hong Kong’s jump of 2.1% and South Korea’s leap of 3% were two of the strongest moves. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Higher Market Volatility Shines a Light on Buffer ETFs
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/etfs/the-uptick-in-market-volatility-shines-a-light-on-buffer-etfs
Time Published: 2025-06-24T14:48:20Z

Advisor usage of the products had been on the rise even before the recent tumult, and the new wave of uncertainty has only fueled that growth. June 24, 2025 Markets are facing a fresh round of uncertainty with the United States striking Iranian targets over the weekend and Iran retaliating by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. Questions loom about the potential for spiking oil prices as observers wait to see if tensions escalate or simmer down. It’s just the latest shock to markets this year. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and subsequent announcements have sent stocks and bonds whipsawing amid on-again, off-again developments. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) currently sits at about 20 and at one point in April reached 50—the highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Easily and efficiently maximizing returns while mitigating risk is the promise driving one of the biggest recent success stories in exchange-traded funds: Defined outcome ETFs. By buying and selling options on the underlying portfolio, like a structured product, these ETFs promise to let investors realize market gains while still getting protection when they fall. The tradeoff: Sacrificing some portion of those gains should the market climb higher than the pre-determined limit. The funds have grown from $5 billion in assets at the end of 2020 to $50 billion by 2025, according to Morningstar. In a recent report, BlackRock projected the space will reach $650 billion by 2030. Even institutional investors are buffing up their portfolios. In December, Bloomberg reported that the University of Connecticut’s endowment sold almost all of its hedge fund exposure in favor of the funds. Related:$6.5B RFG Advisory Launches Suite of Active ETFs “What’s really resonating is the certainty in the downside protection,” said Graham Day, executive vice president and CIO, with Innovator, the firm that launched the first buffer ETF in 2018. “The ability of bonds to protect is now a huge question mark. And so that’s starting to stir the pot more in terms of what advisors are using to manage risk.” Overall, more than 300 buffer ETFs are on the market. Two managers—Innovator and First Trust—still dominate the space, though others are competing by launching variations on the theme (i.e., Calamos has debuted Buffer crypto ETFs) or with lower fees (BlackRock’s funds cost slightly less than the average). Other managers jumping on the buffer ETF train include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, PGIM, Alliance Bernstein and Allianz. “For something that started as a niche product, now the largest asset managers are hopping into the game, which we would expect to drive down costs,” said Patrick Nerney, vice president, investments, with St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Dynasty Financial Partners. “But at the end of day, this is a complex product that requires a nuanced understanding.” Related:Retail Investors Power US ETF Flows Past $500B in 2025 Despite Macro Risks Providers offer a range of buffers, so advisors can choose what percentage of losses they are willing to tolerate and how much upside they are willing to forego. Downside protection can be as low as single-digit percentages or go all the way to 100%. The upside caps vary accordingly. More downside protection, less upside gains and vice versa. As ETFs, they easily fit into most advisor trading platforms and performance reporting tools. They require more handholding than plain-vanilla ETFs. They have fixed time spans—typically a year. Buffer ETFs tied to major stock indices tend to come in monthly flavors, while some newer ETFs offering protection on Bitcoin and other assets are issued quarterly. Investors can roll over into a new version at the end of the defined outcome period. Some try their hand at tactical plays—trading in or out may reduce the protections or, conversely, lock in early gains, but only if timed correctly. In addition, some providers now offer laddered products with blended exposures to provide time-based diversification and automatically roll over into new issuances annually. Related:Seven Must Reads for This Week (June 24, 2025) “The beauty of those is that you can hold them for the long term,” said Rob Kane, director of alternative investments with $285 billion AUM Commonwealth Financial Network. “We continue to see the evolution of trying to make these more of a strategic allocation in a portfolio … something that will be in a portfolio for the next 20 years.” More adventurous advisors use the funds as tactical investments, opportunistically moving in and out of the funds regardless of the time frame in the prospectus. For example, if an investor buys a defined outcome ETF with a 15% upside cap in one month for $100 and the market goes up 5%, they can opt to sell, enter a new buffer ETF, lock in their gains and reset their protection levels. “We do see tactical use where an investor sells if the cap is running out or they want to reset the protection level,” said Lan Anh Tran, a manager research analyst for Morningstar who tracks the sector. “There are people buying in after the buffer periods have started. So, there is some opportunistic investment. But the more common use case is to use these as a hedge. And they make more sense as laddered products.” Because of the options strategies, investors in these ETFs do not receive dividends. “The conversation we often have is, ‘Are you willing to forego dividends and returns in excess of a certain percentage in exchange for downside protection?’” said Curtis Congdon, president of XML Financial Group in Bethesda, Md. “And for many clients who are approaching retirement or wanting to be more conservative, buffer ETFs give them a way to retain equity exposure while having less tail risk.” In addition, buffer ETFs carry higher fees than passive ETFs. Average expense ratios are in the 70 to 80 basis point range. “This category of buffers has not seen the fee compression that other categories of ETFs have,” said Mike Venuto, chief investment officer at Tidal, which advises asset managers on launching ETFs. “Our internal research says that it has an average expense ratio of 72 basis points. If you weigh by assets, it’s 65 basis points. That’s light years away from traditional ETFs. I can see why new issuers are drawn to them.” While recent volatility may have triggered some advisors to give the funds a fresh look, interest has been steadily building over time. In fact, in the year-to-date through the end of April, $5.6 billion flowed into the category, according to data from Morningstar Direct. During the first quarter, “we got about $368 million in inflows,” said Matt Kaufman, senior vice president and head of ETFs at Calamos Investments, which has a variety of defined outcome products, some offering 100% downside protection on the major stock indices as well as Bitcoin. “We see people who are buying new. We also see people selling out of old series, capturing gains and moving into other series to reset their starting points. People are using these exactly as we anticipated and expect them to.” Not everyone is a fan. In March, asset manager AQR Capital Management analyzed 99 ETFs using Morningstar data and found that the ETFs performed worse than passive funds tracking market indices coupled with investments in three-month Treasuries. The researchers argued that there are better ways for investors to hedge risk. That triggered a pair of responses from Vest, the subadvisor that builds First Trust’s buffer products. Vest President Jeff Chang questioned the dataset that AQR chose, which included both buffer and non-buffer ETFs. Chang also pointed out that evaluating buffer ETFs on returns misses the point since the products are not intended to beat the market, but to provide protection. Morningstar’s Jeffrey Ptak joined the debate on his Substack, posted shortly after another article he wrote on Morningstar’s site. Ptak said buffer ETFs, by and large, had delivered on their promises and found “the average dollar invested in buffer ETFs has exceeded the ETFs’ total returns, meaning investors have been able to achieve the potential outcomes advertised.” The buffer funds have weathered the initial COVID-19 market disruptions in 2020 and the wave of supply chain disruption and inflation that hammered 60/40 portfolios in 2022. “They did what they were supposed to do,” Innovator’s Day said. “Sometimes we are asked if these have been tested. In 2020, the VIX was at 70, and they did what they were supposed to do.” However, Jack Zhang, chief investment strategist, alternative investments, with Sequoia Financial, cautioned about how surrendering the upside, at the wrong time, is also a risk of the ETFs. “In the case of the COVID recovery, we essentially got many years of returns crammed into a short time period,” Zhang said. With a capped upside, investors can miss out on those kinds of substantial gains. “In times of crisis, they can provide benefits, but perhaps not as much as other asset classes. Over cycles, being diversified in stocks, bonds and alternatives gives you more of an all-weather approach. I think over the long-term horizon, that just works better than buffer ETFs.” “Our team moved a considerable portion of our client’s domestic and international equity exposure—almost 40%—into these products in February and late March,” said Phillip Knight, a managing director and partner with Americana Partners, a Houston-based wealth management firm with over $8.5 billion in assets under management. “We’re beyond glad that we made this move, but we’ve also found that using these types of tools in a portfolio model adds an element of optionality, and to maximize benefits for our clients, you need to closely monitor the P&Ls of each position.” “We tend to recommend them as a complement to a traditional stock and bond portfolio,” said Gary Quinzel, vice president, portfolio consulting with Minneapolis-based Wealth Enhancement, an RIA with about $100 billion in client assets. “Our dynamically-hedged equity building block portfolio aims to provide exposure to U.S. equities with less beta risk relative to the overall market. Investors can expect a smoother experience.” Wealth Enhancement uses a variety of buffer ETFs diversified by buffer ranges and time periods. Depending on the client, it recommends allocating 10% to 25% of portfolios to the products. “We like to combine the different strategies so we’re hedged against time periods as well as potential downfalls. The end result, if done optimally, is that it can lower beta in a portfolio by 30% to 50%.” Brent Coggins, chief investment officer with Triad Wealth Partners, a Lawrence, Kan.-based RIA with $460 million in AUM, outlined a similar philosophy. “If you look at our investment platform, you will see a bit of everything,” Coggins said. “We have strategies that use the full principal protection outcomes, all the way up to more aggressive, high-single digit protection levels that may have a levered upside. It’s very much case-by-case and all anchored back to identifying the strategy that’s going to maximize the success for the client’s financial plan.” They can be particularly good fits for clients who are more concerned about principal protection than about increasing their wealth—such as investors in or near retirement. “There’s a massive chunk of wealth transitioning from the accumulation phase to the decumulation phase. For them, it’s no longer about, ‘Did I beat the S&P or did I miss it by a couple hundred basis points.’ It’s about, ‘Am I harnessing growth potential,” said Mike Loukas, principal and CEO of TrueMark Investments, which operates a suite of active ETFs, including buffers, under the TrueShares banner. “Investors, to a large degree, are far more comfortable with that tradeoff and the world of hedging than they used to be.” Loukas still sees the benefit of uncapped funds. “There are moments where I’m OK in a normal market, trailing the S&P by a little bit, but in these massive up markets, you can’t afford to trail by 2000 basis points,” Loukas said. “Something that is uncapped has the ability to track the S&P up the ladder without being capped out. It comes down to what individual investors or modelers are looking for, and matching expectations and intents with the right defined outcome for the needs of the portfolio.” While it is always important to see what makes any fund perform the way it does, that’s particularly true with buffers. “The largest education hurdle we’ve had with advisors is that some of these products own underlying large cap stocks. And while those held up awesome at the end of the year, in the recent slide the Mag 7 got hit hard,” said Dynasty’s Nerney. “The index wasn’t down as much as those names, so how were these products lower than the S&P? It was because you’re long large cap tech.” Still, Nerney said the ETFs do have a role to play. “I hope our teams that were using them continue their allocations even though the payoff prolife wasn’t as exciting as it typically is,” Nerney said. “You need to remain systematic in your allocation in any product set you use. [When] portfolios are shedding 5% to 6% a day, there’s nothing like actual protection.” Generally, advisors using buffer ETFs are allocating anywhere from 10% to 25% of a client’s assets to the funds. Buffer ETFs are more common in the RIA space, as broker/dealers more often restrict the investments allowed on the platform, and some have limited the use of buffer ETFs because of the underlying options. “One of the things that still surprises me is that some home offices … say that sounds risky. So, they limit how much an advisor can use them,” Day said. “It’s backwards. If you are an aggressive investor, you can allocate more to these buffers, but if you’re conservative, you can allocate less, which is counterintuitive.” One of the biggest benefits advisors see for the products is mitigating investor behavior, such as panic selling, when markets fall. “Most folks, just by human nature, don’t want to lose money,” Kane said. “So, when you come out and say, ‘We have an option to protect you,’ that’s absolutely great. It’s an easier sell than ‘I would like to put option overlay strategy over your portfolio’, which requires much more nuance to describe. Buffer ETFs are a great way to package it together.” Vest’s Chang also points to behavioral factors as a key selling point. “One of the biggest risks is not volatility. It’s staying invested,” he said. Studies show that investors experience losses 2.5 times more than they experience gains, which often leads them to sell and then miss out when markets turn. “The average equity investor underperforms by 3.5% every year. They would have doubled their returns if they had something that kept them invested.” That makes sense to clients concerned about the heightened volatility roiling markets. “This is when pricing can be extremely attractive,” Chang said. “We are always one tweet away from a 10% move up or down. That’s going to persist for a bit. ... When Henry Ford created the seat belt, less than 10% of consumers paid for that option. But if you’re going to be out there in a Lamborghini, you want to put a seat belt on.” David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. It looks like the Xbox team is facing yet another round of cuts. By Eddie Makuch on June 24, 2025 at 8:14AM PDT Microsoft's Xbox division is facing more layoffs soon. That's according to a report from Bloomberg, which said "major" layoffs at Xbox could be announced next week. This would be just the latest round of cuts at Xbox, following 1,900+ layoffs after the Activision Blizzard deal closed and hundreds more job reductions after that. These cuts, and the ones reportedly planned to be announced next week, are believed to be part of a wider cost-cutting program at Microsoft that has resulted in many thousands of layoffs over the past two years. Tom Warren of The Verge reported earlier this month that Xbox would face more layoffs at the end of June. The timing is seemingly not random, as Microsoft's current fiscal year ends on June 30. Today, The Verge reported, citing a source, that "Microsoft is restructuring Xbox distribution across central Europe, resulting in some Xbox operations ceasing in some regions." A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment when approach by Bloomberg. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft as well in an attempt to get more details. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously said the company needed to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business. Xbox president Sarah Bond gave an answer many were not pleased with as well regarding the job cuts. Some of Microsoft's new moves in gaming recently have included expanding to branded handheld devices and a new Xbox Meta Quest VR headset. 2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft has big plans. Microsoft's reported latest round of layoffs comes amid profitable times for the company. For Microsoft's latest quarter, the company reported net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division specifically has posted year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft's stock price is up by nearly 150% in the past five years. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Debris flows represent a persistent challenge for disaster prediction in mountainous regions due to their highly nonlinear and multivariate triggering mechanisms. This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm-Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-Attention (IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention) model, for precise debris flow hazard prediction in the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin, China. The model is developed and validated using data from 159 debris flow-prone gullies, integrating deep convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures, with hyperparameters autonomously optimized by IKOA. Model explainability is enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which quantify the influence of key factors. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework consistently outperforms 13 benchmark models, achieving a root mean square error of 2.33 × 10−6, mean absolute error of 1.51 × 10−6, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.006%. The model maintains high stability across 50 repeated experiments, strong resilience to 20% input noise, and robust generalizability under five-fold cross-validation. Interpretability analysis identifies potential source energy and maximum 24-hour rainfall as primary determinants and uncovers a dual-threshold physical mechanism underlying debris flow initiation. These findings provide a quantitative basis for adaptive early warning and targeted risk mitigation, and establish a transferable framework for explainable geohazard prediction.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Debris flows constitute a catastrophic geophysical phenomenon that epitomizes the complex interplay between gravitational forces, material rheology, and hydrological dynamics in mountainous environments. These rapid mass movements pose an escalating threat to human settlements, critical infrastructure, and ecological integrity globally, with disproportionate impacts on developing regions with expanding mountain populations [1]. The socioeconomic burden is substantial: between 2000 and 2020, debris flows accounted for approximately 17% of global landslide-related fatalities while generating annual economic losses exceeding 20 billion USD. Unlike other natural hazards with extended warning periods, debris flows manifest with minimal antecedent indicators and propagate at velocities reaching 10 m/s, severely constraining evacuation timeframes and necessitating high-precision predictive frameworks for effective risk reduction [2]. The multifactorial triggering mechanisms underlying these events, characterized by nonlinear threshold responses and complex factor interactions, present formidable challenges for contemporary hazard forecasting. The epistemological evolution of debris flow prediction has traversed distinct methodological paradigms, each characterized by specific conceptual frameworks and analytical limitations. Initial approaches relied on empirical correlations derived from historical event databases, establishing phenomenological relationships for inundation area delineation [3] and precipitation threshold determination [4]. Such frameworks, while operationally accessible, frequently exhibited limited transferability beyond their calibration domains. Subsequent advances introduced physically-based numerical models that simulated the complete process chain from material mobilization through deposition, incorporating rheological principles and granular flow mechanics [5]. These sophisticated simulations demonstrably enhanced impact assessment capabilities [6] and runout predictions in topographically complex terrain. Nevertheless, their widespread implementation remains constrained by intensive parameterization requirements, computational demands, and fundamental uncertainties in constitutive relationships governing material behavior during extreme mobilization events. Intermediate methodological frameworks emerged to address these epistemological limitations through probabilistic formulations and multi-criteria decision architectures. Statistical models employing Bayesian inference frameworks quantified conditional hazard probabilities under varying environmental scenarios, enabling the establishment of robust rainfall thresholds with explicit uncertainty quantification [7]. Concurrently, multi-attribute decision frameworks provided structured methodologies for integrating heterogeneous hazard factors [8], with recent innovations applying Analytic Hierarchy Process techniques to susceptibility mapping across diverse geological contexts [9] and multi-criteria analysis approaches to flood risk assessment in coastal regions [10]. Despite their theoretical elegance, these approaches frequently encounter fundamental constraints in high-dimensional feature space integration and often introduce systematic biases through subjective parameter weighting schemes that compromise prediction reliability. The integration of machine learning (ML) into geohazard assessment represents a paradigmatic transformation in debris flow prediction, facilitating the identification of complex, nonlinear patterns within high-dimensional environmental datasets that remain inaccessible to conventional analytical approaches [11]. Contemporary research has demonstrated the efficacy of artificial neural networks in characterizing rainfall-triggered debris flow probability distributions and advanced information-theoretic coupling methods for susceptibility assessment [12]. These computational frameworks excel in capturing intricate multivariate relationships without requiring explicit physical process formulation [13]. Furthermore, ensemble learning techniques enhance predictive stability and generalization capabilities across heterogeneous environmental conditions previously inaccessible to traditional modeling frameworks. Despite their transformative potential, current ML applications to debris flow hazard assessment exhibit critical epistemological and methodological limitations that constrain their scientific impact and operational utility. First, model performance demonstrates an acute sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, with suboptimal parameterization inducing overfitting phenomena that compromise generalization to novel geomorphological contexts [14]. Second, conventional optimization algorithms frequently converge prematurely to local extrema, resulting in suboptimal exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space [15]. Third, and most fundamentally, deep learning architectures manifest intrinsic opacity that creates a profound disconnect between predictive capacity and mechanistic understanding [16]. This explainability deficit, frequently characterized as the “black-box problem,” represents a critical epistemological barrier in hazard forecasting applications. The black-box problem specifically refers to the inherent inability to trace how deep learning models transform input features into output predictions through their complex internal architectures. This opacity manifests through (1) algorithmic complexity, where numerous interconnected neurons and non-linear activation functions obscure input-output relationships; (2) latent feature representation, where models develop abstract internal representations that lack direct physical interpretation; and (3) stochastic learning behavior, where training procedures yield models whose internal configurations cannot be deterministically predicted. Contemporary neural networks, while achieving unprecedented predictive accuracy, typically obscure the contribution of specific variables to prediction outcomes, thereby inhibiting scientific elucidation of causative mechanisms and undermining the implementation of targeted mitigation strategies. Three fundamental research gaps persist in contemporary literature that motivate this study: (1) the predominant prioritization of predictive accuracy over model explainability creates an artificial tension between computational performance and theoretical advancement; (2) current methodological frameworks overwhelmingly employ single-algorithm approaches that inadequately capture the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering conditions; and (3) the systematic integration of advanced optimization techniques with explainable artificial intelligence frameworks remains largely unexplored in geohazard prediction contexts, particularly for multi-parameter debris flow risk assessment. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, particularly the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach, offer promising solutions to these challenges by providing mathematically rigorous attribution mechanisms derived from cooperative game theory principles [17,18]. Despite preliminary applications identifying dominant controlling factors in debris flow research, comprehensive XAI integration within holistic debris flow assessment frameworks remains substantially underdeveloped [19]. Motivated by these research gaps and the potential of XAI approaches, this study aims to develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework that maximizes both predictive accuracy and scientific explainability for debris flow hazard assessment. The specific research objectives include: (1) identifying optimal architectural configurations for capturing complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering factors; (2) quantifying the relative contribution of environmental, geological, and meteorological variables; (3) establishing a theoretical framework connecting physical processes to prediction outcomes through explainable AI; and (4) determining quantitative thresholds governing debris flow risk to support evidence-based intervention strategies. To address these objectives, this study implements an IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework that integrates physics-inspired optimization algorithms with deep learning architectures and explainability mechanisms. This framework combines convolutional networks for spatial feature extraction, bidirectional recurrent units for temporal dynamics modeling, and attention mechanisms for feature importance weighting, specifically designed to capture debris flow triggering mechanisms while providing SHAP-based scientific insights. The framework advances debris flow hazard prediction methodologically, theoretically, analytically, and practically, offering actionable insights for precision disaster risk management. The overall workflow of the study is illustrated in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g001 Precise determination of influencing factor weights constitutes a fundamental challenge in debris flow hazard assessment. This study proposes a novel game theory-based comprehensive weighting framework that integrates three complementary methodologies: the coefficient of variation method (CVM), entropy weight method (EWM), and CRITIC method [20–22]. Each methodology captures distinct aspects of factor importance: data dispersion, information entropy, and inter-factor correlations, respectively. The proposed framework applies cooperative game theory principles to optimize the collective strengths of these methods, conceptualizing each as a strategic element in a cooperative game to determine optimal weight distribution. The complete framework is illustrated in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g002 The Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA), introduced by Mohamed Abdel-Basset in 2023, serves as the foundation for model optimization in this study. KOA represents a physics-based metaheuristic algorithm inspired by Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion [23]. This algorithm conceptualizes the Sun as the optimal solution and planets as candidate solutions, with planetary motion mechanisms driving the evaluation of solution quality. Compared to established optimization algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), KOA exhibits enhanced exploration capabilities within the solution space through innovative search strategies, enabling effective avoidance of local optima entrapment while ensuring stability and robustness in hyperparameter optimization for complex models. From a mathematical perspective, KOA operates through seven sequential steps: Step 1: Initialization process. The algorithm begins with a random generation of candidate solutions representing planets moving within the search space. Each planet possesses a position and velocity representing potential optimization solutions. Each planetary position is formally defined as shown in Equation (1). In Equation (1), Xi represents the ith candidate solution in the model; d represents the number of dimensions; N indicates the number of candidate solutions; Xji,up and Xji,low determine the boundary range of the search space, with rand[0,1] randomly selected values between and . The eccentricity ei and period Ti are initialized according to Equations (2) and (3). In Equations (2) – (3), r is a random number based on a normal distribution. Step 2: Defining the gravitational force (F). Planets experience varying velocities at different orbital positions due to differential gravitational pull from the Sun along elliptical planetary orbits. The gravitational force experienced by a planet is formulated as in Equation (4), while the Euclidean distance is represented in Equation (5). Step 3: Calculating object velocity. Based on gravitational force and Sun-planet distance, the velocity of a planet at any position on its elliptical orbit is expressed as Equation (6). Step 4: Escaping from local optima. The parameter π in the velocity equation modulates search direction, simulating varying orbital directions of planets within the Solar System. This mechanism prevents convergence on local optima, as shown in Equation (7). Step 5: Updating object positions. Planetary motion occurs in two distinct phases: approaching and receding from the Sun. These correspond to the exploitation and exploration phases respectively. During exploration, the algorithm discovers new candidate solutions. During exploitation, solutions near the optimum are refined, as shown in Equation (8). Step 6: Updating Sun-planet distance. Manipulation of parameter h enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, as shown in Equation (9). Step 7: Elitism mechanism. The algorithm evaluates fitness values between current and newly calculated positions, retaining superior solutions while discarding inferior ones, as shown in Equation (10). Despite the promising capabilities of physics-inspired metaheuristics, optimization algorithms frequently encounter fundamental challenges including premature convergence, local optima entrapment, and suboptimal exploration-exploitation balance. To overcome these intrinsic limitations in the standard KOA framework, this study proposes a systematically enhanced variant, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm (IKOA), incorporating three complementary methodological refinements: (1) Chebyshev mapping for ergodic population initialization, (2) golden sine operator for solution space adaptation, and (3) dynamic weight coefficient for balanced search dynamics. This integrative approach ensures exceptional parameter optimization robustness across complex hypersurfaces. The complete algorithmic architecture is illustrated in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g003 Chaos mapping represents an uncertain and random methodology within nonlinear dynamic systems. In the process of initializing position updates, chaotic variables replace the random variables traditionally used in intelligent algorithm processes, thereby offering a broader search range in the solution space compared to probability-based random search strategies. Consequently, employing chaos mapping for population initialization in the KOA enhances the diversity of the population and the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm. This study utilizes the Chebyshev chaos mapping method [24], with its mathematical description presented in Equation (11), where k denotes the order. The Golden Sine Algorithm (Gold-SA), proposed by Tanyildizi et al., is a novel metaheuristic algorithm [25]. Gold-SA differs from swarm intelligence algorithms by focusing on enhancing search efficiency and optimization precision in the later stages through the gradual narrowing of the current solution space. This means that the current search space continuously converges towards the optimal target value. In the traditional KOA algorithm, the efficiency of local and global searches by planetary individuals is relatively low, making the algorithm more susceptible to becoming trapped in local optima as it progresses. By incorporating the golden sine operator into Step 5, and leveraging the properties of the golden ratio coefficient to reduce the solution space, the overall performance of the algorithm is significantly improved. The position update formula with the added golden sine operator is presented in Equation (12). In Equation (15), R1∈[0, 2π]is a random number determining the distance of the individual’s movement in the next iteration, R2∈[0, π] is a random number determining the direction of the next movement, and x1 = -π+(1-π)*2π, x2 = -π + τ*2πare coefficients derived from the golden section ratio τ=(-1)/2, This ratio narrows the algorithm’s search space and guides individuals gradually towards the optimum. To address the issue of insufficient global exploration capability during the position updates for planets close to the Sun in Step 6, a dynamic weight coefficient based on the number of iterations is introduced in Equation (9). This addition provides a balanced capability for global exploration and local exploitation of the algorithm, as detailed in the improved formula shown in Equation (13). In Equation (13), k1 = 1-t3/T3, k2 = t3/T3. Within Equation (13), k1 is larger in the early stages of iteration, enhancing the planets’ early exploration ability, while k2 gradually increases in the later stages, ensuring the planets’ local exploitation capability in the latter phase. To evaluate IKOA’s optimization capabilities, this study implemented a benchmark analysis using nine standard test functions from the CEC 2005 benchmark suite [26]. These functions provide standardized performance metrics across multiple dimensions: unimodal functions f1-f5 assess local exploitation efficiency; multimodal functions f6-f7 examine global exploration capabilities; and fixed-dimension multimodal functions f8-f9 evaluate performance in complex search spaces. Table 1 presents the mathematical formulations and characteristics of each function. Experimental dimensionality was set at 30 for functions f1-f7 and 2 for functions f8-f9, following standard protocols. The comparative analysis included IKOA, original KOA, and three contemporary algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) [27–29]. Each function underwent 30 independent optimization trials, with convergence trajectories illustrated in Fig 4. The analysis demonstrates IKOA’s superior performance across optimization metrics. IKOA consistently exhibits accelerated convergence compared to reference algorithms, achieving superior early-stage exploration and late-stage exploitation precision while maintaining an exceptional balance between search diversification and intensification. These qualities establish IKOA’s theoretical foundation for application in debris flow hazard assessment modeling, where its enhanced optimization capabilities directly translate to improved predictive performance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g004 This study presents a novel hierarchical deep learning architecture for debris flow hazard assessment that integrates optimization algorithms with specialized neural network components. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework, illustrated in Fig 5, implements a cascaded processing pipeline for multidimensional geophysical data. The CNN module [30] employs convolutional operations to extract spatially invariant features across multiple abstraction levels, identifying complex topographical signatures that serve as precursors to debris flow events. The BiGRU component [31] extends representation capacity through bidirectional recurrent processing, capturing non-linear dependencies in sequential geophysical processes by propagating information in forward and reverse temporal directions. The Attention mechanism [32] implements adaptive computational focus through learned importance weighting, dynamically modulating feature contributions based on contextual relevance. A distinctive contribution is the meta-optimization approach implemented through IKOA, which systematically refines four foundational hyperparameters: Learning Rate, GRU Units m, CNN Filters n, and Batch Size b. These parameters critically influence model performance, balancing expressiveness, computational efficiency, and generalization capability. The implementation proceeds through four systematic phases: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g005 Step 1: Data Preprocessing. Statistical standardization establishes numerical stability while K-Nearest Neighbors imputation preserves data integrity through the reconstruction of missing values. Step 2: Model Initialization. The preprocessed dataset undergoes chronological partitioning with 70% allocated for parameter estimation and feature learning. Step 3: Hyperparameter Optimization. IKOA explores the hyperparameter space to identify optimal architectural configurations through iterative performance evaluation. Step 4: Model Deployment. The optimized architecture is applied to the remaining 30% for validation and hazard prediction generation. The study area encompasses the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin in China (Fig 6), spanning approximately 33,500 km2 and constituting 8.7% of Yunnan Province’s total area. This geographically significant region extends 650 km along the Nujiang (Salween) River, bordered by the Lancang River Basin to the east and Myanmar to the west, spanning from the southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau to the northern extent of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The study area is situated between 24°07’ to 28°23’ N latitude and 98°07’ to 100°00’ E longitude. The geomorphology exhibits extreme topographic heterogeneity characterized by dramatic alpine gorges and precipitous mountainous terrain. The landscape features a pronounced north-south elevation gradient, intersected by the Hengduan Mountain Range. The area contains one of the most significant geomorphological features in the region, the Nujiang Grand Canyon, which ranks among the world’s deepest canyon systems. This exceptional topographic amplitude creates optimal conditions for gravitational mass movements, particularly debris flows with substantial kinetic energy and destructive potential. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g006 The region’s climate is classified as humid subtropical monsoon, characterized by abundant yet spatially heterogeneous precipitation. Annual rainfall demonstrates significant variability, with maximum precipitation reaching approximately 1500 mm in higher elevation zones and diminishing to below 1000 mm in lower elevation areas. Temporal distribution exhibits marked seasonality, with over 51% of annual precipitation concentrated during the summer monsoon period [27]. This concentrated rainfall pattern constitutes the primary triggering mechanism for debris flow mobilization. The geological framework displays exceptional complexity, dominated by metamorphic complexes and sedimentary formations intersected by numerous fault systems. This intricate structural geology, combined with intense neotectonic activity, has produced extensive zones of fractured and weathered lithological material that serves as source material for debris flows. The synergistic interaction between fractured bedrock, steep topographic gradients, and concentrated seasonal precipitation creates ideal conditions for debris flow initiation and propagation. These distinctive geoenvironmental characteristics contribute to the elevated frequency and magnitude of geohazard events throughout the region. The prevalence of these hazards necessitates systematic investigation for effective disaster risk reduction strategies and sustainable regional development initiatives. This research utilizes comprehensive data from 159 debris flow prone gullies distributed throughout the Nujiang River Basin, applying advanced deep learning methodologies to analyze and predict debris flow hazard intensities across diverse geomorphological contexts. Elevation data are based on SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, NASA/USGS). Administrative boundaries and rivers are from Natural Earth (public domain). Map generated by the authors. This investigation established a comprehensive parametric foundation for debris flow susceptibility analysis through systematic integration of multidisciplinary data sources, including extensive literature synthesis [28], satellite remote sensing explanation, field-based geomorphological investigations, and archival geological and hydrological documentation. Advanced geospatial technologies facilitated rigorous extraction of topographical variables from 30m-resolution SRTM DEM data, while meteorological parameters underwent spatial interpolation through geostatistical inverse distance weighting algorithms calibrated with observational data from meteorological stations distributed throughout the study domain. The extracted factors for the study area include: maximum 24-hour rainfall (X1), annual average rainfall (X2), annual average temperature (X3), annual average wind speed (X4), annual average vapor pressure (X5), annual average relative humidity (X6), potential source energy (X7), catchment area (X8), average gradient of the main channel (X9), length ratio of the sediment supply section (X10), length of the main channel (X11), sinuosity of the main channel (X12), drainage density of the catchment (X13), valley profile roundness (X14), vegetation cover rate (X15), average slope (X16), maximum relative elevation difference within the catchment (X17), lithological impact (X18), and dynamic storage capacity (X19). A total of 19 factors were selected, sequentially numbered as X1 to X19. In line with the principles of systematicity, completeness, effectiveness, and comparability in the selection of evaluation indicators, and considering the accessibility and operability of the data, the debris flow outbreak system in the study area was divided into three subsystems: the hydrometeorological subsystem, material source subsystem, and geographic subsystem, encompassing the aforementioned 19 factors (X1-X19). The rationale for selecting each factor is detailed in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t002 Statistical independence among predictor variables constitutes a critical prerequisite for robust hazard modeling. The research implemented Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to systematically diagnose multicollinearity and optimize variable selection. VIF quantifies variance inflation of regression coefficients due to linear dependencies, calculated as 1/(1-R2), where R2 represents the coefficient when regressing a variable against all other predictors. While conventional guidelines suggest a VIF threshold of 10, the current investigation adopted a more conservative threshold of 5 to ensure model stability and parameter precision for complex environmental systems [51]. Multicollinearity diagnosis identified four factors exceeding this threshold: X10 (length ratio of the sediment supply section: 7.83), X14 (valley profile roundness: 5.62), X17 (maximum relative elevation difference: 8.14), and X19 (dynamic storage capacity: 6.95). These variables were systematically excluded to maximize model precision. Fig 7 presents the VIF analysis results for all hazard-causing factors, illustrating that the final variable selection optimizes unique information content while minimizing statistical redundancy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g007 The inherent complexity of debris flow systems necessitates sophisticated factor weighting approaches that accommodate the multidimensional interactions among diverse variables. This study implements the game theory-based comprehensive weighting methodology detailed in section 2.1, achieving optimal integration of complementary weighting perspectives. The resulting factor weights derived from this approach are presented in Fig 8. The hazard level assessment procedure follows a systematic framework: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g008 Step 1: Normalize the original dataset to eliminate the dimensional impact of different factors. The normalization formulas for maximum-type indicators and minimum-type indicators are shown in Equations (14) and (15), respectively. In Equations (14) – (15), xij represents the jth influencing factor of the ith gully, i = 1,2,…,n and j = 1,2,…,m, n denotes the number of data groups, and m denotes the number of factors. Step 2: For each debris flow gully, sum the weighted data of influencing factors to obtain its hazard assessment value. The calculation formula is shown in Equation (16). In Equation (16), wj represents the weight of each factor through Fig 8, and rij denotes the normalized value of the jth influencing factor for the ith gully. To ensure statistical robustness, experimental parameters were standardized with population size fixed at 30 and iteration count at 100 across all optimization algorithms. The dataset underwent a 70%/30% training-testing partition, with results averaged across 50 independent runs. Notably, 12 test samples with distinctive geomorphological characteristics were deliberately included to evaluate model generalization capabilities across diverse debris flow conditions. Performance evaluation employed three complementary metrics: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The proposed IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy when benchmarked against 13 established machine learning regression models [52–55], as quantified in Table 3. Performance comparisons among the top five models are visualized in Fig 9. The hybrid model achieved unprecedented prediction precision with RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6, MAE of 1.51 × 10−6, and MAPE of 0.006%, representing multiple orders of magnitude improvement over conventional approaches. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g009 This superior performance reflects systematic hyperparameter optimization through the improved Krill Herd algorithm. The learning rate underwent progressive refinement from 0.0061 to 0.0014, while GRU units converged to 116, CNN filters stabilized at 54, and batch size optimized at 31. The hyperparameter evolution across iterations, detailed in Table 4, demonstrates the algorithm’s capacity to navigate complex parameter spaces while avoiding local optima. Architecturally, the bidirectional GRU component captures temporal dependencies in multidimensional feature sequences, while the attention mechanism adaptively prioritizes critical factors including slope characteristics, precipitation parameters, and drainage properties. Unlike models such as GWO-ELM and PSO-SVM, which exhibit performance degradation with geomorphologically distinct test cases, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model maintains exceptional prediction stability across diverse geological contexts, validating its effectiveness in modeling the inherently nonlinear and multidimensional nature of debris flow hazard systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t004 Through systematic application of SHAP methodology, this study deconstructs the internal decision processes of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, revealing that the architecture captures both physical threshold effects and multifactorial regulatory relationships governing debris flow initiation. Fig 10(a) presents a quantitative hierarchical ranking of feature importance wherein potential source energy X7 emerges as the predominant factor with a mean absolute SHAP value of 1.07 × 10−2, approximately 4.6-fold greater than the second-ranked parameter. Annual mean temperature X3, annual mean vapor pressure X5, and average slope X16 constitute the second tier of importance, while annual mean rainfall X2, vegetation coverage X15, and main channel length X11 form a distinct third tier. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g010 Fig 10(b) elucidates the dependency relationship between potential source energy X7 and its corresponding SHAP values, demonstrating a threshold effect in debris flow triggering mechanisms. The relationship manifests as a sigmoidal nonlinear curve, optimally fitted by the cubic function y = 1.25 × 10-4x3 - 9.37 × 10-4x2 + 1.83 × 10-2x − 2.21 × 10−2 with an R2 value of 0.98. A critical inflection point is identified at X7 ≈ 3.12 × 109 J/m2, effectively partitioning the risk domain into two distinct regions: a low-risk zone where X7 < 3.12 × 109 J/m2 and a high-risk zone where X7 > 3.12 × 109 J/m2. Within the low-risk zone, SHAP values consistently approximate zero or exhibit slightly negative values, indicating insufficient energy accumulation for debris flow mobilization; within the high-risk zone, SHAP values demonstrate an accelerating positive trend as X7 increases, reflecting the nonlinear amplification characteristic of debris flow initiation. The SHAP value distribution in Fig 10(c) further illuminates the distinct influence patterns of various factors on model predictions. The distribution for X7 exhibits pronounced bimodal segregation: low-value samples cluster tightly around the zero SHAP value region, while high-value samples display substantial positive shifts, reaching SHAP values exceeding 0.2, surpassing the influence range of all other features. This polarized distribution provides statistical confirmation of the threshold phenomenon. High values of maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and annual mean relative humidity X6 similarly exhibit positive SHAP value tendencies, albeit with considerably greater dispersion, indicating that these parameters function as conditional triggers whose efficacy is contingent upon the antecedent state of source energy accumulation. Based on the comprehensive SHAP analysis, a physically explainable mechanistic framework for debris flow formation emerges: potential source energy X7 constitutes the fundamental prerequisite condition with a quantified threshold of 3.12 × 109 J/m2; environmental parameters such as annual mean temperature X3 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 function as regulatory modulators, exerting indirect effects by altering source material stability; hydrological factors, primarily maximum 24-hour rainfall X1, operate as activation triggers that initiate debris flow mobilization only when the prerequisite energy threshold condition has been satisfied. Building upon the identification of potential source energy X7 as the dominant factor, this section systematically explores factor interactions and their impact on debris flow risk prediction, revealing complex relationships with implications for monitoring and early warning systems optimization. Fig 11 illustrates the interaction effects between source energy and key environmental variables. The interaction between X7 and annual mean temperature X3 reveals a significant correlation r = 0.06, p < 0.05, with risk contribution substantially increasing when the temperature exceeds 16°C in high source energy areas. This temperature-energy interaction suggests that thermal conditions may accelerate material destabilization processes in areas with significant loose material accumulation. The practical implication for disaster prevention is that temperature monitoring should be integrated into early warning systems, particularly for regions with high material accumulation. Warning thresholds may require seasonal adjustments with heightened vigilance during warmer periods when temperatures exceed 16°C. Similarly, the interaction between X7 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 demonstrates a stronger correlation r = 0.19, p < 0.01, with high X7 samples manifesting significantly elevated SHAP values when X5 exceeds 15 hPa. This finding indicates that humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks alongside traditional rainfall gauges, particularly in areas with substantial loose material accumulation, as atmospheric moisture conditions appear to play an important role in destabilizing source materials. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g011 The interaction between maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and X7 provides particularly valuable insights for risk management. Despite statistical non-significance in overall correlation r = 0.02, p > 0.05, clear nonlinear patterns emerge: rainfall intensity substantially impacts risk only when source energy exceeds approximately 5 × 109 J/m2, while having minimal effect below this threshold. This conditional relationship fundamentally challenges the conventional rainfall-threshold approach to debris flow warning. For early warning system design, this finding suggests implementing a hierarchical approach where areas are first classified by source energy potential, with advanced rainfall monitoring prioritized specifically in high-energy zones. For low-energy zones, basic rainfall monitoring may be sufficient regardless of precipitation intensity. Rainfall thresholds should be dynamic rather than fixed, adjusting based on source material conditions. Fig 12 refines the threshold identification through a detailed SHAP response analysis. The upper panel presents a higher-order polynomial analysis of the X7 SHAP response curve with R2 = 0.99, identifying a critical inflection point at X7 = 3.00 × 109 J/m2. This value provides a quantitative criterion for classifying terrain vulnerability in hazard mapping exercises and prioritizing areas for source material control measures such as check dams, retaining walls, and slope stabilization projects. The upper right panel identifies a distinct inflection point in the X1 SHAP dependency curve at X1 = 27.01 mm, providing a data-driven basis for rainfall warning standards. This specific threshold offers a quantitative reference for evaluating and potentially adjusting current warning thresholds in operational early warning systems. The lower panel integrates these insights into a comprehensive two-dimensional risk contour map with three distinct risk domains that translate directly to operational warning levels. The blue region represents normal conditions where predicted risk values fall below 0.03, warranting routine monitoring procedures. The yellow zone indicates heightened alert conditions with predicted risk values between 0.03 and 0.20, necessitating increased monitoring frequency and preliminary emergency preparations. The red domain signifies emergency response conditions where the predicted risk exceeds 0.20, requiring immediate protective actions including potential evacuations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g012 Fig 13 extends this analysis into three dimensions, revealing a comprehensive risk response surface that captures the compound effects of X7 and X1. The visualization of threshold planes creates four distinct quadrants that translate to operational intervention priority zones. The first quadrant, characterized by values below both X7 and X1 thresholds, indicates low-priority zones warranting only basic monitoring. The second quadrant, where X7 exceeds its threshold while X1 remains below its critical value, demarcates source-control priority zones where engineering measures to reduce material accumulation should be emphasized. The third quadrant, characterized by X1 values above the threshold while X7 remains below its critical level, identifies hydrological management priority zones where drainage improvements and runoff control should be prioritized. The fourth quadrant, where both X7 and X1 exceed their respective thresholds, delineates comprehensive intervention zones requiring integrated approaches combining multiple strategies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g013 Building on identified risk factors and thresholds, this section evaluates the comparative efficacy of different risk reduction approaches, providing quantitative insights for evidence-based disaster management decision-making. Figs 14(a) and 14(b) present comparative risk response curves for interventions targeting X7 and X1, respectively. The analysis reveals that reducing maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 from 29.5 mm to 27.0 mm yields a 58.8% risk reduction, while reducing potential source energy X7 from 8.0 × 109 J/m2 to 3.0 × 109 J/m2 achieves a 25.0% risk diminution. This substantial difference in intervention efficacy provides clear guidance for resource allocation: rainfall control measures may yield faster risk reduction returns compared to source control measures. Figs 14(c) and 14(d) further refine this analysis through spatially-resolved risk reduction percentage contour maps, revealing that vulnerability mapping should identify transition zones where risk factors are marginally above threshold values, as modest interventions in these areas may yield substantial risk reduction. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g014 Fig 15 presents SHAP force plots from representative data points selected through stratified random sampling, revealing substantial heterogeneity in localized risk factor compositions. This heterogeneity indicates that effective risk management requires location-specific approaches tailored to the dominant local risk factors. For implementation, this suggests customizing monitoring systems based on local risk factor compositions. Locations dominated by meteorological factors would benefit from enhanced weather-based warning systems with meteorological monitoring, while areas where topographical factors predominate would likely respond better to physical infrastructure interventions rather than precipitation-based warning systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g015 Synthesizing these analytical results, a practical framework for precision debris flow risk management emerges with several actionable components. Early warning systems should implement rainfall thresholds that adjust based on source energy conditions rather than universal rainfall values, with lower rainfall thresholds applied in high source energy areas and higher thresholds in low energy areas. Beyond traditional rainfall monitoring, temperature and humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks, especially in areas where source energy exceeds the identified threshold. In resource-constrained environments, interventions should be sequenced according to threshold proximity, prioritizing areas just above threshold values where modest investments yield substantial risk reduction. Different zones require specific approaches: high-source energy zones warrant engineering interventions to reduce source material accumulation; critical rainfall zones require drainage improvements and runoff control; dual-threshold exceedance zones necessitate comprehensive management strategies incorporating both engineering measures and enhanced monitoring systems. Warning thresholds and monitoring intensity should be adjusted seasonally where temperature appears as a significant risk modifier, with heightened vigilance during periods exceeding 16°C. While the specific threshold values identified in this study are calibrated to the study area’s geological and climatological context, the methodological framework for threshold identification and factor interaction analysis remains transferable across diverse geographical settings, allowing regional calibration of specific thresholds while maintaining the structural integrity of the factor interaction paradigm. The stability of a model is crucial for reliable debris flow hazard prediction, as it ensures consistent results across multiple independent runs. To evaluate the stability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, 50 independent experiments were conducted, recording the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and their standard deviations (SD). Lower SD values indicate higher stability and consistency in predictions. As shown in Table 5 the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated minimal performance fluctuations, with an RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6 ± 1.51 × 10−7 and an MAE of 1.51 × 10−6 ± 1.10 × 10−7, outperforming all comparative models. These results highlight the model’s reliability and reproducibility, making it highly suitable for practical applications in debris flow hazard prediction. Its stable performance improves the credibility of risk assessments and provides robust technical support for disaster prevention and mitigation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t005 Robustness is essential for ensuring a model’s reliability when handling data disturbances such as noise or outliers, which are common in real-world geological and meteorological datasets. To evaluate the robustness of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, random noise levels of 5%, 10%, and 20% were added to the test dataset to simulate possible data disturbances. The changes in performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were observed to determine the model’s ability to handle noisy data. As shown in Table 6, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model showed minimal performance degradation. When the noise level increased from 0% to 20%, the RMSE rose by only 7.9 × 10−7, and the MAE increased by approximately 4.9 × 10−7. Compared to other models, these slight increases demonstrate the strong robustness of the proposed model, which ensures high predictive accuracy even under noisy data conditions. This robustness confirms the model’s reliability in complex environments and enhances its applicability to practical disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t006 The applicability of a model is crucial for assessing its practical value, particularly its suitability across different regions and datasets. To evaluate the applicability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, a 5-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were recorded for each fold to assess performance consistency. As shown in the results in Table 7, the RMSE ranged from 2.35 × 10−6 to 2.50 × 10−6, and the MAE ranged from 1.55 × 10−6 to 1.65 × 10−6, with minimal fluctuations across the folds. This consistent performance demonstrates the model’s strong applicability and stability, making it suitable for predicting debris flow hazards not only in the specific study area but also in other geographical regions. Its generalizability provides robust technical support for global disaster risk assessment and early warning efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t007 This study proposes an integrated IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework with SHAP explainability for high-precision debris flow hazard prediction that combines advanced optimization techniques, multidimensional deep learning architectures, and explainable AI mechanisms. Through systematic implementation and validation in the Nujiang River Basin, China, the study yields five principal contributions: The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Information Technology Center, Zhejiang University.

Title: New BlackRock ETF Signals A Strong Focus On The Texas Economy

ByDavid Blackmon ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. BlackRock chairman and CEO US Larry Fink gestures as he addresses the audience, during the annual ... More meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Alpine resort of Davos on January 24, 2025. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) The Texas state government made big news a few years back when it invoked sanctions on big institutional investor BlackRock, claiming the firm’s ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) based investing strategies unfairly discriminated against the state’s oil and gas energy sector. The sanctions were invoked related to a state law passed in 2021, during the height of the ESG investment boom. But that movement has faded rapidly over the past year as oil and gas corporations have refocused their capital allocation strategies away from low carbon projects, which shareholders have noticed also largely proved to be low profit endeavors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has adjusted as well, removing the term “ESG” from his internal and external communications and tailoring BlackRock’s investment strategies to reflect current trends. Most recently, Blackrock has made significant moves to re-engage in the Texas marketplace. Bloomberg reported in late March that Fink’s firm had filed to establish a Texas-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would invest in companies headquartered in the Lone Star State. On Tuesday, BlackRock launched the iShares Texas Equity ETF (NASDAQ: TEXN) to be based off the Russell Texas Equity Index, which is designed to reflect the performance of Russell 3000 companies with Texas headquarters. “TEXN presents a new opportunity for Texans, and investors across the country, to invest in nearly 200 companies powering the state’s economy and to capitalize on Texas’ twin engines of business and population growth,” said Joe DeVico, Head of the Americas Client Business at BlackRock. Despite its controversies with the state’s government, BlackRock was one of the founding investors in the nascent Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE). With current plans to launch operations in 2026, TXSE has taken in over $120 million in capital from investors like BlackRock and Citadel, who see the state and its massive economy as a major growth engine for the future. TXSE plans to function as a national securities exchange and is banking on being able to obtain application approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025. In response to BlackRock’s filing for its Texas-focused ETF, James H. Lee, Chairman and CEO of the Texas Stock Exchange, posted about it on LinkedIn: “BlackRock’s plan to create a Texas ETF is a masterclass move that puts it at the forefront of two key trends. The first is the momentum behind the Texas Miracle. We’re seeing the same demand to invest in and grow Texas businesses, especially since our state is already home to more than one in 10 U.S. public companies. The second key trend is the rapidly expanding market for ETPs, which is projected to grow to more than $25 trillion over the next decade.” Lee added that he was "excited that the world's largest institutional investor is making another bold strategic move in our great state.” So, despite the dustups with state officials of the recent past, BlackRock maintains a large and growing presence in Texas. According to BlackRock’s Texas state spotlight, they have over $379 billion invested in Texas public companies, $134.6 billion invested in state energy, and over $14 billion invested in Texas municipal bonds on behalf of clients. In fact, BlackRock today stands one of the largest investors in Texas oil and gas. For Fink and his management team, the motivations for such a robust presence in the state are obvious. Investing in Texas, as TEXN will promote, not only strengthens the state’s energy infrastructure but also aligns with and advances America’s rapidly evolving national energy policy objectives. Texas is the nation’s largest energy producer, accounting for 41% of national crude oil and 25% of natural gas production. The state also leads the country in both wind and solar power generation capacity, making up about 28% of U.S. wind-powered electricity. Regardless of anyone’s personal views about the various forms of generation, all investors must recognize that grid infrastructure like transmission lines and upgrades, battery storage systems, and weatherization of critical facilities require constant injections of new capital. These rising levels of investment are crucial for maintaining grid stability and accommodating renewable energy sources and baseload generation from natural gas, coal and nuclear alike. For Texas’s nation-leading suite of wind and solar installations, programs like the federal government’s $7 billion investment in the Solar for All program, including nearly $406 million for Texas, and the Renewable Energy Electric Generation (REEG) program in Texas, which has attracted approximately $62 billion in investments, provide major injections of such capital. The same is true of the state’s natural gas generation sector, which is again embarked on a growth path as power generators strive to meet Texas’s rapidly expanding electricity demand in the coming years. In essentially every possible way, Texas stands as a pivotal player in the U.S. energy landscape. There is no question the state must be able to attract major, strategic investments to maintain and further bolster its leadership in energy production, grid reliability, and clean energy transition. BlackRock continues to invest heavily in local industries, including energy, infrastructure, and real estate because Texas offers what few other states can: low taxes, light regulation, a booming population, and thriving energy and tech sectors. In the end, while political drama may dominate headlines, economic and energy reality drives investment decisions. Texas remains a place where business still comes first, and BlackRock, through its investment in the TXSE and establishment of its Texas-focused ETF, appears committed to both Texas and financial returns in its continuation of doing business in the state.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 06: In this photo illustration, the logo of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 06, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) has experienced a remarkable surge in its stock price, climbing approximately 600% over the past twelve months. This impressive growth is largely due to the success of its recent rocket launches and the securing of new contracts, including those for its new Neutron rocket. While the existing Electron rocket is designed to deploy small payloads, with a capacity of up to 300 kilograms, into space, Rocket Lab's second and more powerful vehicle, the Neutron, will significantly increase this capacity, capable of carrying up to 13,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit. While these advancements are promising, Rocket Lab's stock appears expensive and unattractive at its current valuation, especially given its recent significant rally. We’ve reached this conclusion by analyzing RKLB stock's current valuation against its recent operating performance and its historical and present financial health. Our comprehensive analysis of Rocket Lab USA, assessing Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, indicates that the company has only a moderate operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, RKLB stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Rocket Lab USA's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Rocket Lab USA’s profit margins are considerably worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Rocket Lab USA's balance sheet looks very strong. RKLB stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Rocket Lab USA's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Rocket Lab shows impressive sales growth and a strong financial position. It's understandable for a company at this early stage to have negative margins and a high cash burn rate. Despite these positives, the stock appears to have priced in all the good news, currently trading at 35 times its trailing revenues. While the upcoming Neutron rocket launch and potential new orders could certainly drive the stock higher, the current valuation presents a high risk. Additionally, there’s the broader concern of a market downturn given the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical climate. We’ve seen how sensitive the stock can be to such conditions, as evidenced by its over 80% drop during the 2022 inflation shock market correction. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Meta’s Quest 3S Xbox Edition Is a Great Value, but There’s Just One Big Tradeoff

Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoftâs wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S’ displays don’t offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience. Meta first hinted at a Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition in 2023, around the time it offered users a native Xbox app for Meta Quest to enable easier game streaming. The $400 Xbox Edition Quest 3S doesnât let you play any of your Xbox games natively. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft’s streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain. Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition The Xbox edition bundle is a great deal, plus the headset looks better in black. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming. Pros Cons Microsoft and Meta opting for the Quest 3S rather than the Quest 3 makes the bundle cheaper, but it’s less effective for game streaming. I’ve become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it’s what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. However, the $500 Quest 3 has a wider, 110-degree horizontal FOV (field of view) compared to the 3S at 96 degrees. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on whatâs normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, thereâs a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best. The Quest 3S lenses are equivalent to what was on the QuestÂ 2, and the resulting image quality is slightly more grainy than what you get on a Quest 3. The Fresnel lenses combined with limited FOV can result in blurred images around the periphery of the display. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you’re directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. It’s not unplayable, but it could make some games potentially annoying. While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Chief among them is lag. Games on Quest stream at 1,920×1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Anything less, and you’ll experience input lag and blurred visuals. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I’m already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing. If you donât own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The Elite Strapâwhich offers better comfort than the default headbandânormally retails for $70. The controllerâs suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. Overall, you save $95 compared to buying everything separately, though you’ll need to spend $20 per month later to maintain access to game streaming. If you were buying outside the bundle, you could get a $400 Quest 3S with 256GB of storage compared to 128GB. If you plan to use your headset for game streamingâwhether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titlesâyou wonât have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store donât take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option. Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. Black and green are far more striking than the bland white of the last several Meta Quest headsets. The neon accents help sell it as a âgamer device,” enough that it shouldnât stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. The stock-standard Xbox controller is an oldie but goodie, and the green accents added to the joysticks lend it a little extra flair without being too overt. Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole âfamilyâ of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. That canât be the case with a Meta Quest that uses the companyâs own Horizon OS. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, weâll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London. A former animation president at Warner Bros. and Comcast's DreamWorks is betting he can create the next Hollywood franchises with the help of AI — and just raised $11.6 million to do it. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump announced a cease-fire between Iran and Israel. Israel says Iran has violated it. We're looking at how the markets are reacting — and what they're expecting next. What's on deck Markets: Real-estate investors are no longer counting out San Francisco. Tech: Leaked files and the startup's own contractors are calling Scale AI's security into question. Business: Why we should all know less about each other at work. But first, the markets are hopeful. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "Please do not violate it!" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post earlier this morning. He was referring to a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, which Trump said was "now in effect." It was the news the markets had been waiting for. European and US stock-index futures both jumped, while the dollar fell against all its major peers and gold, a safe haven asset, dropped 1.3%. Oil prices, meanwhile, continued their plunge. Hours later, Israel's defense minister said Iran had violated the cease-fire — and vowed to respond with "powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran." Iran has denied the accusation. BI is covering this developing story. Follow our coverage. In many cases, the traditional risk-off response would've hampered the early-morning market rally, yet US stock futures are still firmly up. While the latest developments appear to signal a renewed escalation, markets are reacting as if this is a temporary disruption in an otherwise steady move toward de-escalation. We saw a similar thing yesterday, when Iran said it fired missiles at a US military base in Qatar. Fears of supply disruption would normally send oil prices up, but the attack was largely believed to be symbolic — Trump thanked Iran for giving the US "early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost." Oil prices continued to fall. Investors had also been pricing in geopolitical risks for months. "There wasn't much in the way of escalation so markets breathed a sigh of relief," Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI. We might be witnessing a similar scenario play out. A cease-fire hangs in the balance, but amid a cloud of uncertainty, it seems the markets are holding their nerve. 1. Don't get too excited about Tesla's stock jump, UBS says. The EV-maker's stock leapt 11% Monday morning after its robotaxi launch, but UBS said the opportunity is "already priced into the stock" in a note. Tesla's stock has been on a wild ride this year and is still down 13.6% YTD. 2. San Francisco could be in for a real estate rebound. The city is buzzing again thanks to RTO mandates. While the average rent price is still below pre-pandemic levels, they're predicted to tick up. Large investors are aiming to capitalize on a rebound by buying up multi-family homes. 3. The housing market is slowly turning in favor of buyers. A Redfin report showed US home prices rose 0.7% in May, the smallest increase since 2023. They expect this trend to continue and potentially start showing year-on-year declines by the end of 2025. 1. Scale AI's data security problem. The startup, which uses public Google Docs to track internal work for its high-profile clients, has left multiple AI training docs labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with a link, BI has found. While there's no indication that Scale AI's practices have caused a breach, one expert called it "dangerous." 2. Leave a tip? JK! Tesla's robotaxi service trolls users who try to tip their non-human drivers, some commuters discovered shortly after the robotaxi launch in Austin. See what happens when you try. 3. Chatbots are competing for users on WhatsApp. The messaging app, owned by Meta, is "the largest surface that people use Meta AI on," according to Mark Zuckerberg. It's also becoming an AI free-for-all as rival chatbots compete for audiences, which could hurt Meta's quest to become the default AI provider, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Make coworkers mysterious again. It's good that workplaces have become more inviting, but there's a cost to sharing too much. Besides annoying coworkers and managers, oversharing can hurt an employee's reputation and their organization's, writes BI's Emily Stewart. 2. Compass is lawyering up to fight Zillow. The real estate brokerage accused Zillow of violating antitrust laws by forcing listings onto its platform in a lawsuit filed Monday. Zillow has been beefing with big brokerages since they started gatekeeping certain listings, arguing that they're creating an uneven playing field for homebuyers. 3. DTC bedding brand Parachute folds 19 stores. Parachute shrank its retail footprint from 26 to seven storefronts over the past year, becoming the latest direct-to-consumer brand that's struggled to scale or turn a profit. It said it plans to focus on e-commerce and partnerships with retailers like Target instead. New York City primary mayoral election.

Google has reportedly cut the budget of its smart TV team by 10%, according to a report from The Information, citing people familiar with the situation (via Android Police). The budget cuts are said to be linked with recent layoffs at the Google TV division, despite Google planning to revamp the smart TV platform with its Gemini AI later this year. Google TV is what powers the Google Chromecast with Google TV, the new Google TV streamer, and various smart TVs and media players made by third-party manufacturers. Back in September, Google announced that there are now over 270 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV devices on the market. However, it’s hard to see Google taking its smart TV platform as a priority despite aggressive competition from Amazon, Roku, and built-in software experiences from Samsung (Tizen) and LG (webOS).

There are more than 270 million Android TV devices, and we remain committed to growing this ecosystem with an exciting road map ahead.” According to the report, the budget cuts affecting Google’s smart TV team come at a time when the company is focusing more on YouTube as its main entertainment platform. Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan boldly claimed that “YouTube is the new television,” with TV now being the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. YouTube also brings Google a lot of revenue through advertising and premium subscriptions like YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which has 8 million subscribers in the US. The Information reports that Google would like to take the platform into new directions to better compete with streaming platforms like Netflix. YouTube recently hired long-time Disney executive Justin Connolly as its global head of sports and media. The move quickly led Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against YouTube and Connolly. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

June 24, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s 8% rebound – Will Q3 push ETH to $3K?

Time Published: 2025-06-24T12:00:56Z

Caught between conviction and caution, Ethereum tests a key supply wall. After nearly two weeks of relentless selling pressure on Ethereum [ETH], a sharp 8.27% green candle has emerged, at press time, clawing back nearly 21% of those losses in just one move. On closer look, this resembles a textbook “reset and rebound” setup, where a cooldown offered patient investors a shot at discounted supply, especially with macro FUD starting to ease off. Yet, the line between a relief rally and a breakout could be razor-thin. According to AMBCrypto, which side Ethereum lands on may well dictate its directional bias heading into Q3. Yet again, Ethereum’s two-week decline has been noticeably steeper than [BTC], with ETH shedding 26% from its $2,878 mid-June peak, more than double BTC’s 10.89% drop. And this wasn’t just a fluke. While Bitcoin showed relative resilience, Ethereum’s Short-Term Holder (STH) NUPL plunged into the capitulation zone right as ETH broke below the $2.5k mark, after nearly a month of tightly range-bound trading around that level. This was further confirmed by a surge in realized losses, suggesting that STHs began unwinding their positions in weakness. Now, with ETH climbing back toward that same $2.5k zone, these holders may view the rally as a break-even escape, right as Ethereum re-enters a high-density cost basis cluster, as highlighted by the chart below. Source: Glassnode The yellow and orange bands highlight where most Ethereum holders bought their supply, clustering heavily around this zone. Numerous entries sat specifically in the $2.4k to $2.6k range, making it one of the most crowded and critical areas to watch as ETH approaches resistance. If ETH pushes through this band with strength, it could clear the way for further upside. But if weak hands step in to exit at breakeven, it could turn into a near-term ceiling. As Ethereum climbs into a key cost basis cluster, whether holders stay confident in a continued move higher could shape how Q3 plays out. Despite a solid run through Q1 and Q2, ETH still hasn’t managed to reclaim the $3k level, a psychological barrier that might push some investors to sell early, especially with macro risks still lingering. That’s why the recent $100 million in ETF inflows feels encouraging, as it shows fresh capital is still flowing in. Pair that with a 9.3% jump in Open Interest and a 61% long bias on Binance ETH perps, and clearly, the market’s leaning bullish. Source: CoinGlass But is this conviction? Or are we looking at blind optimism, a setup for another volatility-driven shakeout just as ETH nears resistance? Well, BlackRock’s recent $18.4 million sell-off adds a layer of caution. Smart money seems to be dialing back, too. So, unless Ethereum can break through that $2.4k– $2.6k supply wall with strength, the idea of a clean run to $3k in Q3 might be a stretch for now.

More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the latest stock market chart of the company in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 25, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Note: Costco FY’24 concluded on September 1, 2024. Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) shares have experienced significant growth, increasing by 40% in 2024 (calendar year) and tacking on another 7% so far in 2025, easily surpassing the S&P 500’s 2% increase. What’s fueling this momentum? Robust performance supported by its membership model. In fiscal Q3 2025 (which ended on May 11), Costco generated $63.2 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in operating profit. Of that amount, $1.2 billion was derived from membership fees alone—accounting for nearly half of the operating profit, and primarily recurring. With inflation putting pressure on household budgets, Costco’s value-oriented model is resonating well with consumers. In May 2025, sales experienced a year-over-year increase of 7%—more than twice the 3% growth across the broader U.S. retail industry. At first glance, it seems like a retail paradise. However, here’s the drawback: Costco is trading at 55 times earnings and 59 times free cash flow, resulting in a meager 1.7% cash flow yield. For perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which enjoys faster top-line growth and exposure to high-margin sectors like cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. While Costco may claim scale, strategic position, and market affection, it comes at a hefty cost. Refer to Buy or Sell Costco Stock? Costco’s valuation assumes perfection, and even a minor deceleration could lead to turbulence. To put it in perspective, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares plummeted nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020, and 32% during the inflation-driven pullback of 2022. Investors should remain aware of that history, even as the current fundamentals appear strong. Costco’s high valuation is based on its consistently strong performance. In fiscal Q3 2025, the company achieved earnings per share of $4.28, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase, on $63.21 billion in revenue, an 8% rise. Comparable-store sales increased by 8% year-over-year, while e-commerce grew by nearly 15%, excluding fuel and currency impacts. Membership renewal rates remained exceptional, at 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada, and 90.2% globally, with total household memberships rising by 6.6%. In the latest quarter, Costco’s U.S. same-store sales surpassed Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.5% and significantly outperformed Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 3.8% decline, highlighting the warehouse model’s attractiveness to value-oriented shoppers. The company’s high-margin, recurring membership revenue has shown remarkable resilience during economic hardships, contributing to the stock’s recent surge. Operating 905 warehouses worldwide, including 624 in the U.S., Costco leverages its pricing advantage through extremely thin margins and the efficacy of its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. In Q3, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, while the average transaction size only rose by 0.4%, showing that foot traffic—not price inflation—is driving the growth. Costco’s adaptable supply chain has allowed it to manage increasing tariffs by redirecting shipments and altering sourcing strategies. With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed—less than 3% for this fiscal year—and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could come under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: HIMS Stock To $25?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/03/31: In this photo illustration, the Hims & Hers Health logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Hims & Hers Health (NASDAQ: HIMS) experienced a devastating 35% stock crash on June 23, 2025, after Novo Nordisk abruptly terminated their brief partnership. The dramatic sell-off reflects not just the immediate loss of a key business relationship, but fundamental questions about the company’s long-term viability in the weight-loss drug market. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. On a separate note, see – Is Iran Bluffing While Readying An Attack? The collaboration between HIMS and Novo Nordisk, which began in April 2025, was supposed to be a game-changer for the telehealth company. The partnership promised direct access to Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drug, through HIMS's platform. This arrangement had fueled much of HIMS's remarkable 150% stock surge earlier this year, as investors bet on a clear pathway to sustained revenue growth. However, the partnership lasted barely two months. Novo Nordisk cited concerns over what it called "illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing" by HIMS, specifically pointing to the company’s continued sales of personalized, compounded versions of semaglutide (Wegovy’s active ingredient) rather than focusing solely on the branded medication. The dispute highlights a fundamental tension in the weight-loss drug market. Following the FDA’s declaration that the semaglutide shortage had ended, compounding pharmacies technically lost their legal justification to produce copycat versions of the drug. Yet HIMS continued marketing personalized versions of the treatment, which Novo Nordisk viewed as undermining their branded product and potentially violating regulatory requirements. This strategic misstep by HIMS reveals a deeper problem: the company appeared to prioritize its existing compounded drug business over nurturing the partnership that investors had priced as its future growth engine. The decision to continue selling personalized versions while simultaneously partnering with Novo Nordisk created an untenable conflict of interest. The stock crash, while severe, may still not fully reflect HIMS’s diminished prospects. Even after the 35% decline, HIMS trades at approximately seven times trailing revenues— more than double its five-year historical average of three times revenues. This elevated multiple made sense when investors expected the Novo Nordisk partnership to drive explosive growth, but that rationale has now evaporated. If HIMS were to revert to its historical valuation multiple of three times revenues, the stock would fall to around $25 — representing another 40% decline from current levels. This suggests the selling may not be finished, particularly as investors reassess the company’s growth trajectory without its key partnership. HIMS can theoretically continue selling personalized obesity treatments, but this approach faces multiple headwinds. The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the FDA potentially intervening if it determines that companies are abusing compounding loopholes rather than providing genuinely personalized medicine. The loss of Wegovy’s direct sales potential also eliminates what could have been a massive revenue stream from the company's existing member base. The question now becomes whether HIMS’s remaining business model can generate sufficient growth to justify any premium valuation. The company's personalized approach may serve a niche market, but it's unlikely to match the scale that direct Wegovy sales could have provided. The HIMS situation represents a classic case where investors should resist the urge to "buy the dip." While the stock’s 35% decline appears dramatic, the fundamental investment thesis has now been altered. The company has lost its clearest path to significant revenue growth and faces an elevated risk profile regarding regulatory compliance. For now, the prudent approach is to wait and observe how the situation develops. HIMS may find alternative pathways to growth, but without the Novo Nordisk partnership, those routes are far less certain and likely less lucrative. The market's brutal reaction to the partnership termination sends a clear message: when a company's primary growth catalyst disappears overnight, even a 35% decline may not be enough to restore attractive risk-adjusted returns. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. 1.

Title: If you think your job is hard right now, try working in HR
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hr-workers-miserable-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-24T08:35:03Z
Full Content:
Over the past 18 months, Evan Loveless has led seven rounds of layoffs, personally informing hundreds of his ad-agency colleagues that they were being let go. "It's a chronic feeling of sadness because it's so frequent for me," said Loveless, a senior human-resources partner in St. Louis. "It's like being stuck under a raincloud." Loveless recalled a particularly soul-crushing layoff conversation with a worker who thought he was reaching out with news about a promotion. "Sometimes the person's husband or wife also just lost their job," he said. "You see their faces and then their faces haunt you a little bit." Working in HR has never been glamorous, as the occupation often requires enforcing unpopular company rules and decisions. Now, HR professionals say the job is getting downright ugly. Unceasing layoffs, stricter return-to-office mandates, immigration raids in the workplace, and a sudden need to help everyone master AI are among the latest challenges upending their workloads. "It's a confluence of events that are occurring simultaneously, the likes of which and magnitude of which I never have observed in my more than 30 years of being a human-capital leader," Jim Link, chief human resources officer for the Society of Human Resource Management, told Business Insider. The new rigors come after another tumultuous period for HR workers. During the pandemic years, they suddenly had to develop and manage remote-work set-ups, grapple with anti-vaccine pushback, and deal with employee tensions and calls to action following the murder of George Floyd. Today, HR teams are juggling even more, said Tracy Brower, a Ph.d sociologist in Michigan who researches organizational behavior. "The demands on HR today are significant, increasing, and intense," said Brower. One of the new tasks HR is having to deal with is the impact of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the workplace. Several times a week foreign workers now come to Alexandra Valverde, an HR director for a midsize food manufacturer in the Southeast, with concerns about getting swept up in raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Some have tears in their eyes. "This is the hardest year I've had in HR," said Valverde, who's been working in the industry since 2019. "The fear I'm seeing from employees, even if their status is completely fine — that is something I hadn't experienced before." The steady drumbeat of layoffs is also particularly unsettling for HR workers at companies with staffers on H1-B visas, which allow foreigners to temporarily live and work in the U.S. if they meet certain criteria. "It's never easy to lay anybody off, but it's even harder when you're telling someone they're probably going to leave the country," said Mike Smart, an HR executive at a California tech company. Upon losing a job, H1-B workers typically have just 60 days to find another employer or face deportation. "Even in the best of job markets, 60 days isn't ample by any stretch," said Smart. As of May, employers have announced 696,309 job cuts this year, an 80% increase compared with the same period last year, according to a new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Making matters worse, the cuts are coming at a time when company chiefs are warning of even more layoffs coming down the line due to the rise of generative AI and AI agents. Last week Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company's extensive use of the technology is expected to reduce its total corporate workforce, which totaled approximately 1.5 million last year. CEOs of other companies, including chatbot maker Anthropic, freelance-job site Fiverr, and payments provider Klarna, have recently issued similar declarations. HR workers are used to taking heat for implementing policies that don't sit well with workers. But lately they say it's gotten a lot harder to keep their cool. In the second quarter, employees at organizations that experienced layoffs in the past year committed 67% more acts of so-called workplace incivility on average than those at firms without such cuts, according to new SHRM data. Those acts, which the trade group says includes silencing and excessively monitoring colleagues, were also 63% higher among workers at organizations with return-to-office mandates than at those without. David Gaspin, the head of HR for a commercial real-estate company in New York, said that at his previous employer he was hit with "some serious vitriol" from a colleague he thought he had a good relationship with after having to lay this person off last year. The tongue-lashing included comments such as "you're just a corporate tool" and "you're a horrible human being." "That's never easy to hear," said Gaspin. Given the more taxing landscape, it's perhaps no wonder that fewer people are looking for work in HR. Searches for HR jobs on Indeed.com in the first half of this year were down nearly 5% from the first half of 2024, and they've been declining annually since 2021, Indeed data show. Separately, a 2022 study from LinkedIn found HR had the highest turnover rate of any job function. (The job site hasn't updated the report since then.) Rebecca Taylor, a former HR professional in New Jersey who co-hosts a podcast called HR Confessions, said one reason she left the field is that she was tired of always being the office grinch. The final straw came after a worker she was tasked with laying off looked up her parents' landline and called them repeatedly to chastise her. "It was scary," said Taylor, who uses a pseudonym partly because of that incident. If a disgruntled employee is angry enough, she added, what else will they try to find? Jump to

Title: Implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing with Axon Framework in Spring

Modern enterprise applications often require complex consistency, scalability, and traceability features. This is where CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing shine. Together, they allow systems to scale efficiently while preserving a full audit trail of all state changes. In this article, you’ll learn how to implement CQRS and Event Sourcing using the Axon Framework in Spring Boot. We’ll cover: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the write model (commands) from the read model (queries). This decoupling allows each side to scale and evolve independently. Instead of storing the current state in a database, Event Sourcing stores all changes to the state as a sequence of events. For example, instead of storing: You would store: The current state is rebuilt by replaying these events. The Axon Framework simplifies the implementation of CQRS and Event Sourcing in Java. It provides: Let’s walk through a sample implementation of an Order Management System using Axon. Replaying hundreds or thousands of events to restore state can slow down system performance. Snapshotting solves this by saving the state of an aggregate after a certain number of events, so only a few need to be replayed. Axon Framework makes it surprisingly manageable to implement CQRS and Event Sourcing in Spring Boot. With proper use of aggregates, projections, and snapshotting, you get a scalable, event-driven architecture that’s built for the long haul. Whether you’re building systems that need audit logs, complex workflows, or massive scalability, Axon gives you the building blocks to make it happen cleanly and reliably. We will contact you soon.

Title: A Postcard from Cannes Lions: Power Struggles, Winners, and AI

This year’s Cannes Lions, the ad industry’s biggest festival, unfolded against a backdrop of upheaval and anxiety. The industry is at a critical moment—facing “an existential crisis,” as S4 Capital founder Martin Sorrell told ADWEEK’s editors—but little of that fear was present on stage. While celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Schwarzenegger took center stage, and teams posed with gold trophies on the red carpet, executives on the ground spoke with ADWEEK about issues such as AI, agency consolidation, and layoffs. The event was also marked by an aggressive land grab, both for literal pieces of the Croisette and for marketing budgets. Certain power struggles were visible throughout the festival: Adobe versus up-and-comer Canva, both of which upped their budgets for activations this year. Amazon versus… everyone else. And Michael Kassan’s 3CV versus his former company, MediaLink. Even in the creative awards, rivalries–such as that between holding companies Publicis Groupe and WPP–were on display. Publicis Conseil, a jewel in the crown of the former holdco, won both Agency of the Year and the Titanium Grand Prix, while WPP was named Creative Company of the Year. In the latest episode of Adspeak, the ADWEEK editorial team reports from the sandy beaches and hot pavements of Cannes about who came out on top at the festival, what’s behind the parties and beachfront activations, and what Cannes says about where the industry is headed.

Title: An elegant and hefty cheeseburger bento awaits at the “Japanese Costco” Lopia

Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese It’s so classy, you’ll want to eat it with a knife and fork. There’s a supermarket in Japan nicknamed the “Japanese Costco” because much like its namesake, it sells very large quantities of food at bulk-discount prices. Its real name is Lopia, and our writer Ikuna Kamezawa often enjoys going there even though many of the things for sale are way too big for her to ever eat on her own. But this time, a certain cheeseburger bento caught her eye. It was large, but not too large, and only cost 1,078 yen (US$7.40), so she decided to take the meaty plunge. It was so big that she could barely fit it into her shopping bag and things only got worse as it started to rain while she walked home. She had to carry it very carefully too, for reasons we’ll see in a moment. After getting home, she unveiled her Manpuku Burger Double Cheese and confirmed its size at about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. Popping the lid off we can see that the very fancy arrangement was why Ikuna had to carry it so carefully, and the sheer volume of it all was the reason it was priced a little more than a Big Mac combo. She felt kind of bad disturbing the elegant layout of her bento, but she had to take stock of what was inside before eating it. There was a double cheeseburger with two patties and two slices of cheese, some seasoned fries, and two breaded chicken filets. That photo might not do the size justice so she took some shots alongside a pack of matches for scale. Sure, a matchbox might not be the most universally understood comparison, but she was just so excited to eat this thing. ▼ Fries ▼ Chicken Filets ▼ Double Cheese Burger Ikuna turned her attention back to the cheeseburger and tried to reassemble it in a normal way. That’s when she noticed something was off with the proportions of the bun and patties. She thought this must be some chic designer cheeseburger arrangement she’d never seen before. That might give the illusion Lopia is being chintzy with the meat, but rest assured they were good-sized beef patties. For a more understandable comparison, Ikuna placed a Yamazaki Bakery convenience store cheeseburger next to it. This store-bought burger selling for about 99 yen is slightly smaller than a McDonald’s cheeseburger and the Lopia burger blows it out of the water. ▼ Lopia’s burger ▼ Yamazaki’s burger There were definitely some structural integrity issues with it though, so our writer opted to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork. A fancy burger like this deserves fancy eating utensils anyway. The hamburger patty wasn’t juicy at all, but it was very dense and meaty. This texture might turn some burger aficionados off, but she felt kids would really go for it. There was also a sweet ketchup on it, but really the flavor of the beef stood out so much that she barely even remembers eating the cheese and bun. While it might not be for everyone, the taste of this burger bento was right up Ikuna’s alley. Her only complaint — if you could call it that — was that it was too much for her to eat in one sitting. But for the price she paid, that’s the kind of problem you’d want to have. In conclusion, she definitely recommends the Manpuku Burger Double Cheese for big eaters. Lopia can be a little random with their offerings, especially in the bento section, but Fridays are known as “Fry Days” there which is when they usually go all out in that department so your best chance is to find it then.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against Compass Diversified, Digimarc, Elevance, and West Pharmaceutical and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

June 23, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

Title: Incoming Data Points To An Economic Slowdown: Fed Behind The Curve

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Hostilities in the Middle East caused some angst in the equity markets, but not as much as one might have expected. The major indexes were only down between -1% and -2% for the week as shown in the table. Markets await President Donald Trump’s decision regarding U.S. involvement, and that will surely play on market sentiment in the coming days.1 On a year-to-date basis, after huge advances in 2024, the three large-cap equity indexes appear to be treading water, while the small-cap Russell 2000 has given back more than half of its 2024 gain (see table). Markets appear to be more attuned to the softening economy than the Federal Reserve is.2 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. It was also a down week for the Magnificent 7, with only AAPL and TSLA in positive territory. For the year, it is a mixed bag for these seven. Three are positive (NVDA, MSFT, and META) while AAPL, TSLA, and GOOG are down double digits (with AMZN down in the mid-single digit range). It appears that the equity market has become much more selective as often happens in the late stages of a bull run.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. More Soft Data- Retail Sales Much of the incoming data has been soft. Let’s begin with Retail Sales. They fell -0.9% in May. The consensus estimate was for a -0.6% drop, so a miss to the downside. In April, they also fell, but to a much milder extent (-0.1%). It appears that we are still on the downside of the curve and expect more softness going forward.4 Clearly, the U.S. consumer has become cautious. May’s decline was the largest in more than two years (since March ’23), and the April/May results are the first back-to-back declines in more than 18 months. The question is what does this tell us about the future? While the chart below shows a slight hook-up in the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, note that most of 2025 has shown quite a significant downtrend. And we don’t expect a sudden change in the consumer’s outlook anytime soon. University of Michigan Retail Sales isn’t the only indicator flashing weakness. Industrial Production, having climbed out of its nearly two-year funk in 2025, declined in May and, given the recent soft survey data (which leads the hard data), appears destined to fall into negative territory soon (see chart below). The utilities sub-component was off -2.9% (was this weather, or a thriftier consumer?), machinery -1.0%, construction supplies (-0.7%) and even the production of consumer goods was off (-0.2%). Bucking the negative trends was production in the Tech space, which was up +0.4% in May (from April) and +10% from year earlier levels. Except for Tech, weakness prevailed.5 The most recent Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index showed up as -4.0 in June (same as May’s -4.0) with its New Orders sub-index falling to +2.3 in June from +7.5 in May. In addition, the workweek turned negative (-1.6 in June from +2.0 in May), an indicator of a slowing manufacturing sector, and, most concerning, the employment sub-index dove to -9.8 in June from +16.5 in May, the largest drop in this sub-index since the Pandemic.6 Federal Reserve Housing, too, showed weakness in May. Unsold inventory, both in the new and existing home spaces, has risen and that is beginning to weigh on home prices. The National Association of Home Builders conducts a monthly survey of its members. The June survey score was 32, falling for four of the last five months. This was the lowest reading since December 2022. Note that the pandemic low was 30 in April ’20. Per Rosenberg Research (Breakfast with Dave June 19, 2025), the current level (32) is the same as it was in 2007 and lower than at any point in the 2001 Recession. In addition, the current sales outlook (35 vs. 37 in May) is the lowest since 2012. U.S. Census Bureau In addition, Housing Starts in May surprised hugely to the downside at an annual rate of 1.256 million units. The consensus estimate was for 1.350 million. This is the lowest level since May 2020 (the depths of the Covid-19 lockdowns) and is -9.8% lower than April’s pace. Starts are now down -4.6% from year earlier levels and look to shrink further over the next few months. Furthermore, building permits (see chart above), clearly a leading indicator, fell -2.0% in May (vs. April) and have fallen in five of the past six months. There is little on the horizon that is going to change this. Also of note is the decline in tourism. David Rosenberg noted in his June 20 daily missive (Breakfast with Dave) that tourism from Europe is off -25% through May versus a year ago, and his description of the loss of tourists from Canada was, in one word, “massive.” This bodes ill for the tourism sector going forward. In past blogs we’ve noted the rapid rise in both auto and credit card delinquencies. Add to this the Trump administration’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s moratorium on student loan payments. The chart below says it all. Delinquencies through the roof. And note that those who are now actually making their student loan payments must forego other uses of those funds, a large portion of which was consumption. This is another negative for economic growth in the near term. FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax At its June meeting, the Fed kept rates at their relatively high levels. It appears to us that the Fed has fallen further behind the curve. Chair Jerome Powell continues to indicate that the Fed is waiting for the “hard” data to soften. Well, retail sales are falling, the housing sector has turned soft, and production continues to decline. While the U3 Unemployment Rate remained at 4.2% in May, it was only because of a shrinkage in the Labor Force Participation Rate (the denominator). In our view, this occurred because jobs are harder to find than they were a couple quarters ago, and people just drop out. The -626,000 job loss that showed up in the Household Survey should have been a wake-up call to the Fed. Clearly, it wasn’t.6 In their June dot-plots, the Federal Open Market Committee sees two rate cuts in 2025, which would leave the Federal Funds Rate somewhere near 3.75%. Neutral, by the Fed’s own definition is 2.5%. With weakness in the survey and now showing up in Retail Sales, Housing, Production and Consumer Sentiment, that 3.75% forecast year-end rate will be uber-restrictive. Since changes in Monetary Policy impact the economy with a significant lag, the incoming data says that the Fed should be easing now. On Friday (June 19), Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a leading candidate for the chairmanship once Powell’s term as chair expires next May, commented on CNBC that he would consider a rate cut at the July meeting. We hope other FOMC members see what he sees.6 Financial markets held up better than expected in the face of Middle-East hostilities. We suspect that won’t be true if the U.S. enters the fight. After the large run-up in 2024, nearly halfway through 2025 shows near breakeven in the major indexes and a -5% loss in the small-caps. Without a new stimulant, and with an economic cooling trend now evident in the data, there appears to be limited upside for the general indexes. “Selectivity” will become the new watchword.2 3 Incoming data continues to show softness, including Retail Sales and Industrial Production. Consumer Sentiment is on a downward trend. These are not good signs for economic growth. Nearly every piece of data coming out of the housing sector is negative. This includes housing starts and building permits. We are just beginning to see home prices stabilize and perhaps pull back a little bit. Tourism to the U.S. from both Europe and Canada has fallen significantly (perhaps there will be bargains this summer for American tourists). Delinquencies continue to rise. Now that the payment moratorium on student loans has ended, add the student loan category to the list. And note that those who are now making their monthly payments have fewer dollars for discretionary purchases. Meanwhile, in the face of a weakening economy, the Fed kept policy tight, and the new dot-plot reveals an FOMC moving a bit toward even more hawkishness. We hope that Governor Waller’s view (open to a rate cut in July) gains traction among FOMC members as the soft economic data dribble in.6 (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple is weighing the pros and cons of an acquisition that could help it acquire more AI talent and products. On the flip side, there are reports that Apple might partner with the company instead of buying it. This partnership could lead to an AI search engine powered by Perplexity and integrating the company’s tech into Siri. The report says Apple has made no formal offers, but has met with the company several times lately. This deal and/or partnership is likely spurred by two things. First is the potential for Apple and Google’s deal for search on iPhone to evaporate as U.S. courts look at Google as a monopoly on the search market. Apple is also seen as behind the competition in AI, and a major move like this is bound to be good for the stock price. The Bloomberg report mentions that Google’s stock fell a point after the news went live about Apple’s possible AI acquisition. There’s also some speculation that Sam Altman and OpenAI’s deal with ex-Apple design legend Jony Ive on some AI hardware might be putting pressure on Apple to get into the AI game sooner rather than later. That being said, Apple is working on its own AI tools, so it’s likely a matter of how long it thinks those will take to make and how much the company actually cares about what Wall Street thinks. There is an argument to be made that with Apple’s dominant market share in the iPhone, it can likely afford to be a few years late to the AI game, especially since we’ve seen so many issues with the current crop of generative and search AI tools. However, previous reports said Apple’s top executives are split on AI adoption, so things might be stalling in either direction. The report also mentions that Meta has already made an offer to buy Perplexity, but the companies couldn’t come to an agreement, so Meta invested in Scale AI. Perplexity’s CEO says that Meta even tried to poach them for its ‘Superintelligence’ team. Meta has also approached staff from OpenAI and offered salaries with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta’s investment in Scale was US$14.3 billion, (C$19.6 billion), so it stands to reason that the company offered a similar deal to Perplexity. The AI startup is valued at US$14 billion (C$19 billion) after its last funding round, so I expect it will cost even more if Apple wants to buy the company. The big question I have at this point is, if Apple is considering making big AI moves, will that delay some of the already announced features, like the Siri enhancements we’ve been waiting for since WWDC in 2024?

Title: Coffee Break: Nihilists at Google Wrecking Existing Business to Chase AI Growth

Full Content:
In 2016 Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that “in the long run, we’re evolving in computing from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world.” In 2018, he famously told Kara Swisher that AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.” It’s generally over-looked that he opened that statement by saying “We don’t take a very optimistic view of AI” and closed by responding to Swisher’s comment that “fire is pretty good” with “(fire) kills people too, we have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we have to overcome its downsides too.” And yet, just over four years later Pichai, by then also CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, issued a ‘code red’ and directed multiple department heads including those in charge of research, trust, and safety “to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of AI prototypes and products.” This directional switch took place only three weeks after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. At the time, The New York Times warned that “because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact” and “that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building.” The Times also quoted University of Washington professor Margaret O’Mara saying, “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.” That was in late 2022, as of mid-year 2025, it is clear that Pichai has damaged Google’s brand and its core search product in a seemingly competition with OpenAI. As I tried to understand what Pichai was doing, my initial framework was Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” concept defined as when “vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.” Over the past year I’ve found Ed Zitron’s analysis of Google’s decision-making has deepened my understanding of WTF Pichai is up to. I’ll come back to Zitron in a moment, but for those new to his work, I’d recommend giving these three pieces a quick skim: I’ve also found pioneering AI researcher Gary Marcus’ work very useful — he flagged most of the limitations of LLM AI decades ago and has been consistently vindicated in his skepticism that the current OpenAI and Alphabet approach to AI will truly prove “as important as fire.” We’ll come back to Marcus too. But first I want to touch on an idea that Naked Capitalism readers have seen recently in another context via Curro Jimenez: nihilism. Curro was quoting the French sociologist Emmanuel Todd’s analysis of Israel’s recent behavior in Gaza and Iran and this quote jumped out at me: “Perhaps in the unconscious depths of the Israeli psyche, being Israeli today is no longer about being Jewish — it’s about fighting the Arabs.” I would argue that for Pichai and those remaining at Google under his leadership, being Google today is no longer about being the dominant search engine — it’s about fighting OpenAi/ChatGPT. On Wednesday, I’ll be applying Todd’s formulation to the current leadership of the Democratic party which is no longer about being the party of the working class but rather it’s about fighting off the progressive wing of the party. Now, let’s dive into Ed Zitron’s explanation of why Google is willing to risk its incredibly lucrative core search business and maybe even destroy the open web itself in a quest to compete with Open AI. Zitron is an effective polemicist so let’s let him cook a little: Google no longer provides the “best” result or answer to your query – it provides the answer that it believes is most beneficial or profitable to Google. Google Search provides a “free” service, but the cost is a source of information corrupted by a profit-seeking entity looking to manipulate you into giving money to the profit-seeking entities that pay them. The net result is a product that completely sucks. …That’s because Google has, like every major tech company, focused entirely on what will make revenues increase, even if the cost of doing so is destroying its entire legacy. Google has announced their own “Bard AI” to compete with Bing’s ChatGPT integration, and I’ll be honest – I feel a little crazy that nobody is saying the truth, which is that Google broke the product that made them famous and is now productizing fixing their own problem as innovation. … Venture capital and the public markets don’t actually reward or respect “good” businesses or “good” CEOs – they reward people that can steer the kind of growth that raises the value of an asset. …Sundar Pichai isn’t paid $280 million a year because he’s a “good CEO.” After all, Google has all but destroyed its search product. He’s paid because he finds ways to increase the overall growth of the company (even while their cloud division still loses money), and thus the stock goes up. Zitron expanded on these ideas in his “Business Idiot” piece: Our economy is run by people that don’t participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don’t experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. Ewan Morrison elegantly summarized why Pinchai’s commitment to AI is so riskly to its search business and the Open Web itself: One drop of sewage in a glass of water turns the entire glass into sewage.This is happening with AI hallucinated facts on the internet. AI systems have 48% error margins & are turning our historical, news, philosophical & scientific info on the net into sewage.Do not drink it. pic.twitter.com/nN0dhV9Dg2 — Ewan Morrison (@MrEwanMorrison) June 19, 2025 And like Captain Ahab, Pinchai knows he must have a crew just as dedicated to his suicidal mission as he is. He might not be nailing a gold coin to the mast and demanding loyalty oaths, but he is aggressively pushing buy-out offers on Googlers who are not down with the program: Remember Google is offering buyouts to employees who aren’t all-in on how the company is doing things and it’s “AI first” direction. Sadly, I have to think that still working for Google at this point means they support what’s happened and how the company intends to become an an answer engine. — Katherine Argent (@effthealgorithm) June 21, 2025 Let me wrap with a couple of paragraphs from Freddie de Boer about the issues the whole of tech faces and why it thinks AI is the answer: the hype is a phenomenon driven by needs that are fundamentally financial in origin. The tech companies need a new suite of products that can restore their eroding profitability and inspire the public the way that the public was inspired in the late 2000s and early 2010s; the financial sector and investors need the tech companies to be the unicorn stocks that they once were. As usual with speculative capitalism, the tail is wagging the dog. When hockey stick growth does not emerge naturally from reality, it will be invented. Media hype about AI, the almost literal absence of any countervailing narrative, the relentless way that the stodgiest publications inflate the threats/hopes that have been invested in these technologies… it’s all downstream of the desire to feel about tech the way people did in the Obama era and the demand from the moneyed to have the right lottery tickets to buy. A lot of people who are used to getting what they want are looking to let the good times roll again, and “AI” is precisely the kind of vague instrument into which they can throw those hopes. Anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes is simply told that they don’t understand the technology, and every year that goes by that human life is not seriously disrupted by this technology is just a minor delay. Rinse and repeat. In future posts, I’ll look at other players in the AI space — OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Tech billionaires have debunked the myth that private companies produce the best products. They charge the highest prices for the lowest quality products. The solution is clear: nationalize search engines and AI. Hey, it worked for Larry Ellison / Oracle. Everyone else is just following in his footsteps. Some would point to IBM as the original innovator in this space. The rot goes way back. You can nationalize the industry, or the industry can privatize the government. As things stand, the top echelons of the tech giants see their interests largely aligned with the ideologues and bureaucrats and power-seekers in the state apparatus. A new trend is top dudes at Palantir and other companies joining the army (and immediately being promoted to Lt. Col.). It goes both ways. Privatizing will work until it doesn’t. Expect catabolic disruption in the coming year as capabilities get converted to cash leaving nonfunctional systems, not obviously reparable. Mariana Mazzucato in ‘The Entrepreneurial State” discusses the contribution of state funded, mostly university based, R&D, including blue sky research, and covers the big Pharma low risk predisposition. She uses the i-phone case study, as GPS, touch screens and other essential component technologies were all state funded. However, she doesn’t evaluate state directed research against resource consumption, so any comprehensive systems analysis. The values applied often involve military uses, such as through DARPA, but sustainability or social usefulness is more spinoff than deliberate. In the 250 years since the Industrial Revolution we don’t seem to have learned that purely profit oriented development is often damaging both to society and environment. The US definitely has an issue with short-term thinking, and that influences how the gov’t and companies interact with AI, but there’s a lot more going on. Russian President Putin said he was treating AI as on par with nukes in strategic importance. The capacity for AI-enabled weapons to transform war means those who don’t have it are severe underdogs. And while there’s a lot of “ai slop” there is a lot of genuinely impressive capability that is consistently improving, even with occasional bad updates, enshittification, short-term incentives, and so on. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. AI isn’t going away, and it will only get better (at least for the paying customers, if not for consumers of “free” services who are actually the ‘product’). Just because US companies are structurally stupid (because the owners enforce short term thinking on executives) doesn’t mean AI is not a game changer. Fundamentally, what is google? A search engine! what does a search engine do? It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly instead of sifting through industry technical standards, endless usenet forums, news website archives, or whatever data source – that’s a big shift, and clearly it’s possible even if now it’s not yet super reliable. That’s why one of Google’s top execs recently said something like “we will go bankrupt before we lose the AI race”. Their search was already degrading years ago and financially they were doing just fine. But this LLM chat-interface really could eat their lunch, and they see that. It sounds like they don’t know how to preserve their ad biz just yet, but they know they need to be at the forefront of this new tech and rebuilding their revenue streams to incorporate it, not hold on to an old model that just won’t be as competitive. There’re are a lot of reasons to be upset with Google, but their embrace of LLM-based interactions at the search page backed by their traditional search engine seems smart to me. Separate from the chat interface is LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways. That will transform search. Google would be foolish not to go head first into this and get the best people and capabilities early on. Don’t get me wrong, I think AI is a disaster for humanity and it’s already having lots of terrible impacts, as NC had documented. But I think ragging on Google for trying to jump on this new tech is not acknowledging the situation they’re in, or the likely future abilities of the tech. Google search sucks because they refused to filter out the spam, because the spam was what brought in the revenue. However: It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. At least you were honest enough to put it in quotes. If this is the direction society is going, we’re doomed. The FDA evaluating drug safety on what AI halucinates from the swamp of anti-vax drek? EPA deciding pollution rules based on the weight of anti-regulation spam out there? Building codes revised to reflect opinion pieces by developers and material vendors? Because that’s all that AI is – it’s running a popularity contest to see what the most probable ‘answer’ is for any input. That results (for now) seem reasonable is just because the spam hasn’t had a chance to overwhelm the valid, human generated content. Just wait. Completely agree. The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. I don’t use Chrome or Google search, but this makes me appreciate Brave browser’s Leo AI in search, which at least cites each website as the source(s) for each detail in its “answer,” and gives links to each cited website below that “answer,” making it easy to click through to verify. But yeah, as we all seem to agree, AI ain’t a thing to celebrate. Sorry, you are kidding yourself. AI had been caught out repeatedly fabricating sources You cannot trust its sourcing. DO NOT USE AI for research, FFS. It isn’t even OK for transcriptions, as IM Doc has reported long form. That’s not true, it’s quite possible to verify a LLM response’s veracity. At the end of your query, add a clause to give citations. I never make a query without doing this. And then I always check the links, as I would with wikipedia. Essentially I just use it to point me to the original source material. It’s been helpful a number of times. This also helps me keep tabs on how often the AI makes shit up, and when. Ha ha. And how many people know to do this? 0.00..01%? Or bother? But they’ll act on the ‘answer’ nonetheless. And what makes you think the citations aren’t hallucinations? And what makes you confident Google et al won’t conveniently change their query processing to ignore your clause, as they’ve done with boolean operators, “exact” match clauses and uncountable other changes they’ve snuck in on the sly? But you do you. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. These examples are based on pattern matching, which is something that certain AI technologies can do pretty well. Don’t confuse these with llvm applications, which try to find the the most probable series of human authored tokens in their training data to correspond to a prompt. I don’t anticipate anything good or useful coming out of llvm, partly because of its high error rate, and partly because of its tendency to corrupt future training data. LLMs have no reasoning capability. Agreed. This whole phrase is utter nonsense: “LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways” I don’t buy it. There are many kinds of reasoning. Some kinds AI is terrible at, and some it’s very impressive at. People’s definition of “reasoning” is changing dramatically, as AI is proving more and more capable. Obviously there are huge reasoning gaps, but they’re shrinking, and much of the pattern matching is simply good enough for many applications if used carefully. Look at geo-guessr. A huge amount of deductive reasoning goes into deciding on a location from clues in the picture. I also know two people who got better medical advice from chatGPT than actual doctors, for non-trivial problems, and in one person’s case it’s been a helpful ongoing consultant. Again, I’m no fanboy and mostly avoid AI and LLMs especially. And I’m very willing to ack the drawbacks and negative influences on society which are copious. But let’s acknowledge the capabilities that are there. No, your assumption is false. First, AI does not and never reasons. Saying it does is a massive category error. Second, LLMs will never never never have enough source material on which to train. So they train on other LLM generated material. That generates more errors over time. It’s a multiplying “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Narrow AI (like reading certain types of images) may perform well, but not the ones you encounter most often, the LLM. There are many articles like this if you would listen to something other than the hype: LLMs are getting dumber and we have no idea why https://www.ignorance.ai/p/llms-are-getting-dumber-and-we-have AI Hallucinations Are Getting Worse. What Can We Do About It? https://builtin.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-worsening-solutions Newer LLM models are getting worse https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardselfllm_this-is-interesting-the-newer-llm-models-activity-7330013445070741505-_6cj I’ll circle back to ChatGPT and the fundamental reason it is not going to replace Google search. Ed Zitron has demonstrated beyond a doubt that it is not financially viable, not at the free level, not at the premium level. Their last best hope seems to be a turn toward surveillance tech but they’re going up against Palantir and multiple incumbents there. Google’s P/E is down to 18, so lower and more normal compared to the rest of the tech sector (Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA are all around 30-40, Meta is 25). So investors are increasingly valuing the stock based on actual revenue, not some nebulous growth potential. AI race is all about restoring the perception of these tech stock as having growth potential and pushing the P/E ratios back up without creating actual revenue. Short-term game because you can only maintain the illusion for so long, but enough to create substantial stock price growth for Pinchai and his buddies to collect their bonuses and cash out. Computer sub-literate here, so it’s a given that my opinion/analysis transacts at a very high discount, but I still have to rhetorically ask: if AI is being trained on an ever-increasing mass of Internet data, ever more of which is trash/increasingly enshittified, then isn’t it inherently entropic? We know too well the quality of it most Internet content, and I assume it exceeds the amount of pre-digital knowledge/information daily if not hourly. As humans become ever-more passive and stupefied by tech, why is AI not doomed to become the equivalent of a fiftieth-generation photocopy, or Gresham’s Law applied to information science? See, it doesn’t take an engineering degree to see the basic fallacy at play! You are entirely correct. Your intuition is correct and has already been confirmed scientifically. Not that those mega-corporations care much about it… Maybe AI will kill these corporations and their leaders if this is to be believed: https://www.newsweek.com/ai-kill-humans-avoid-shut-down-report-2088929 Yes. Essentially it is exactly what it says it is, a Probability engine based on a Large Language Model database that includes all inputs stored in that database, good or bad, scientifically valid and invalid, copyright protected or not. And now I will break for lunch… hopefully the wood glue has kept the cheese from sliding off my pizza and onto the broiler floor. Another illustration of this was the Facebook experiment (in 2017 I think) where they had two AI chatbots talk/negotiate with each other. They ended up both speaking in gibberish (which was framed as ‘inventing their own language’) before being shut down. In hindsight, it was a good example of a closed AI loop with no human input eventually becoming unstable. Both of them were operating on content completely different from their training set, resulting in unpredictable and degenerate output, which then fed back into the input and contributed further to the problem. Thank you for this post. I find much of what Ed Zitron has to say, e.g., on tech companies and their CEOs in general, fairly perceptive. He identifies the fundamental problem of scaling in gen AI (similar to that which Yves has identified for blockchain), in his post There Is No AI Revolution: Putting aside the hype and bluster, OpenAI — as with all generative AI model developers — loses money on every single prompt and output. Its products do not scale like traditional software, in that the more users it gets, the more expensive its services are to run because its models are so compute-intensive. And later, The only product that OpenAI has succeeded in scaling to the mass market is the free version of ChatGPT, which loses the company money with every prompt. This scale isn’t a result of any kind of product-market fit. It’s entirely media-driven, with reporters making “ChatGPT” synonymous with “artificial intelligence.” my pleasure as always to post for this wonderful community. And yes, Zitron and Gary Marcus are my go-tos on AI scepticism. Zitron on the business side and Marcus on the tech fundamentals. We are in the midst of the biggest Ponzi scheme in human history. “still working at Google at this point” might also mean that most workers, even highly paid tech workers, are still workers that rely on a paycheck and have to make choices in life in regards to what kinds of principals you can eat and what kind you cannot eat. Oh, what a world where we could all say fock you to the American capitalist elite and just quit this exploitative system en mass. I occasionally use AI to to double check that I have covered most or all of the relevant bases of subjects I once knew well but I haven’t looked at for some stretch of time. It’s truly amazing how much BS hallucination gets injected as fact, which someone with even a rusty degree of subject matter expertise might easily catch, but think of the poor souls who used AI to breeze through their education or training, and who haven’t developed the critical eye to help them distinguish actual fact from AI fact. AI is the super-highway to Idiocracy. Excellent post and comments. For my part I did a Google search on Ahab’s gold coin because high school was long ago and I wanted a refresher. The Wikipedia article on the Moby Dick coin is pretty good, but I wanted to go a bit deeper. That led me to using ChatGPT with the following transcript: https://chatgpt.com/share/6859bdda-f50c-8004-940c-f7a995af0e2d showing it’s not just math errors you have to watch out for. I just find it remarkable that this glib AI pretends to know so much, spins unsupported theories, asserts easily discovered falsehoods, and is obsequious but not regretful when confronted. Reminds me of certain annoying people from high school. Back then people would have blamed the parents, which seems even more justified here and now. Just when you do a Google search these days you get the AI answer at the top of the results. Sometimes they give good leads but that is what the original search page did. But often it totally misunderstands the query and gives information of something completely different and is akin to asking a stranger a question who makes up an answer rather than admit that they do not know or are guessing at the answer. We have been finding that the first pages of “results” from our Google searches are now all infotainment and commercial ads disguised as “information.” Earlier years of Google search showed how good results can be provided to the questioner. This proves that the system can be designed to function for the searcher’s benefit. Today’s Google search is proof that the “service’s” core function has been deliberately degraded to rent seeking behaviour. Stay safe…information now available for a small fee from Google! thank you for the kind words and the analysis of AI’s summary of Ahab’s speech. Oh the lulz. Sometimes it pays to be old. I need to find a new copy to replace my long lost copy from 1976 and re-read Computer Power and Human Reason. Joseph Weizenbaum was right when I was the youngest guy in the lab and he is still right when I am the oldest guy in the lab. The noise-to-signal ratio is a lot higher now, though. YMMV but I seem to have found that presearch.com works fairly well. Almost 60 years ago, a text by Mortimer Taube has been published that anticipates much of nowadays discussions about AI: “Computers and Common Sense – the Myth of Thinking Machines”. Still holds. Interesting article, Nat, and it’s great to see these topics covered on NC. I think I disagree with some of the reasoning behind Google’s pivot to AI. It’s not wrong to say the Google search sucks and Google’s prioritization of their ad revenue has made their core product worse. This also comes at a time when Google has to share more and more of its ad market with competitors. No, I think this pivot to AI is a part of a strategic shift for Google. Cloud hosting is much harder for competitors to break into due to the amount of physical investment, and its customer base is much less fickle than ad firms. If consumer markets tank (as I’m sure they will, soon), cloud hosting will still be immensely important for most institutions, governments, and militaries. Sure, firms everywhere are planning on replacing their workers with ChatGPT, which almost definitely will not work, but many in the military are salivating over the potential AI can play in streamlining intelligence gathering, targeting, and offloading the liability of killing. Breaking into military contracting is no easy task, as the majority of this sector has been monopolised by Raytheon and the like for decades now. With Google’s cloud offerings like Project Nimbus, the Israelis are allowing the IDF to easily build and host AI systems to conduct their genocide; they have the perfect testing ground for future product offerings to both the US military and beyond. Big, billion-dollar contracts in a sector where there will only be a few competitors (Amazon, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Oracle) sound a whole lot better than trying to save a faltering product like Google search when it’d be too little, too late. thank you NM. It’s entirely possible you’re correct. Google execs just have to be smarter than I’m giving them credit for or its the biggest deliberate destruction of shareholder capital in my lifetime. Amazon, Oracle and MSFT are definitely using AI to make cloudside plays but I don’t see Google cracking the top 3. However I think there remains a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in delivering high quality search — you know, the kind Google had up to about 2015 or so. It may be a situation where we are both correct to an extent. Don’t forget that Alphabet also owns DeepMind, which I would argue is one of the largest AI companies (that has certainly been overshadowed by others like OpenAI recently). In the Project Nimbus contract (the deal between the Israeli state and AWS and Google Cloud to build 6 “soverign” data centres), Israel stated specifically that they chose Google and AWS over Microsoft and Oracle because of their increased AI capabilities. I did a factual Google search yesterday, with its now automatic AI synopsis, but more in hope than expectation. This was for the full line-up of a one day rock festival I attended in London on May 7th 1972 which gig included both top British and American acts. It was a sellout, with 10,000 there. Yet, apart from one headliner, there is no accurate information – no-one seems to have documented this one-off. Most bands have their own (often obsessive) biographers with tours and gig lists. Most classic venues have their own proud historians. Details often even go as far as set lists, timings, and band members. Google AI then invented a line-up, including merging rock bands and acts who were not there but who performed at other 1972 UK rock festivals, (Reading is 50m away from London) and even adding in from tours in different years. The AI account was totally fictional, hopefully not in a deliberate Orwellian disinformation mode, but with an exceptionally high “Garbage In, Garbage Out” quotient. How harmful can AI be when it is incredible, and with such a low level of accuracy ? This level of factual precision, masquerading as being both an ‘intelligent’ and reliable response, is positively harmful, if there is any genuine expectation of believability. It was as fake as a White House briefing. I’ll suggest that there is a threshold, say the Leavitt threshold of truth, against which current and future AI is measured. The question then arises as to whether any real world decision making ought ever to be left to AI generated material, when even a simple rock concert lineup ends up as distorted as a hall of mirrors. For all I love about NC, this is one of the most insightful comment threads I’ve ever witnessed. As a reader of NC for over 20 years I am truly humble to have posted the post that triggered this conversation. GOOGL doesn’t want to get lapped by a new technology.

Title: Build an agentic multimodal AI assistant with Amazon Nova and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation

Time Published: 2025-06-23T17:36:31Z
Full Content:
AWS Blogs Modern enterprises are rich in data that spans multiple modalities—from text documents and PDFs to presentation slides, images, audio recordings, and more. Imagine asking an AI assistant about your company’s quarterly earnings call: the assistant should not only read the transcript but also “see” the charts in the presentation slides and “hear” the CEO’s remarks. Gartner predicts that by 2027, 40% of generative AI solutions will be multimodal (text, image, audio, video), up from only 1% in 2023. This shift underlines how vital multimodal understanding is becoming for business applications. Achieving this requires a multimodal generative AI assistant—one that can understand and combine text, visuals, and other data types. It also requires an agentic architecture so the AI assistant can actively retrieve information, plan tasks, and make decisions on tool calling, rather than just responding passively to prompts. In this post, we explore a solution that does exactly that—using Amazon Nova Pro, a multimodal large language model (LLM) from AWS, as the central orchestrator, along with powerful new Amazon Bedrock features like Amazon Bedrock Data Automation for processing multimodal data. We demonstrate how agentic workflow patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-tool orchestration, and conditional routing with LangGraph enable end-to-end solutions that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) developers and enterprise architects can adopt and extend. We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds. We also highlight how you can apply this pattern in industries like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. The core of the agentic pattern consists of the following stages: This iterative decision-making enables the agent to handle complex requests that are impossible to fulfill with a single prompt. However, implementing agentic systems can be challenging. They introduce more complexity in the control flow, and naive agents can be inefficient (making too many tool calls or looping unnecessarily) or hard to manage as they scale. This is where structured frameworks like LangGraph come in. LangGraph makes it possible to define a directed graph (or state machine) of potential actions with well-defined nodes (actions like “Report Writer” or “Query Knowledge Base”) and edges (allowable transitions). Although the agent’s internal reasoning still decides which path to take, LangGraph makes sure the process remains manageable and transparent. This controlled flexibility means the assistant has enough autonomy to handle diverse tasks while making sure the overall workflow is stable and predictable. This solution is a financial management AI assistant designed to help analysts query portfolios, analyze companies, and generate reports. At its core is Amazon Nova, an LLM that acts as an intelligent LLM for inference. Amazon Nova processes text, images, or documents (like earnings call slides), and dynamically decides which tools to use to fulfill requests. Amazon Nova is optimized for enterprise tasks and supports function calling, so the model can plan actions and call tools in a structured way. With a large context window (up to 300,000 tokens in Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Nova Pro), it can manage long documents or conversation history when reasoning. The workflow consists of the following key components: These components are orchestrated in an agentic workflow. Instead of a fixed script, the solution uses a dynamic decision graph (implemented with the open source LangGraph library in the notebook solution) to route between steps. The result is an assistant that feels less like a chatbot and more like a collaborative analyst—one that can parse an earnings call audio recording, critique a slide deck, or draft an investor memo with minimal human intervention. The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of the agentic AI workflow. Amazon Nova orchestrates various tools—including Bedrock Amazon Data Automation for document and image processing and a knowledge base for retrieval—to fulfill complex user requests. For brevity, we don’t list all the code here; the GitHub repo includes a full working example. Developers can run that to see the agent in action and extend it with their own data. To demonstrate the multi-tool collaboration agent workflow, we explore an example of how a question-answer interaction might flow through our deployed system for multi-tool collaboration: If anything is missing or a tool encountered an error, the FM orchestrator triggers the error handler (up to three retries), then resumes the plan at the failed step. The following figure shows a flow diagram of this multi-tool collaboration agent. This solution is built on Amazon Bedrock because AWS provides an integrated ecosystem for building such sophisticated solutions at scale: You don’t need to assemble a dozen disparate systems; AWS provides an integrated network for generative AI workflows. The architecture demonstrates exceptional flexibility through its modular design principles. At its core, the system uses Amazon Nova FMs, which can be selected based on task complexity. Amazon Nova Micro handles straightforward tasks like classification with minimal latency. Amazon Nova Lite manages moderately complex operations with balanced performance, and Amazon Nova Pro excels at sophisticated tasks requiring advanced reasoning or generating comprehensive responses. The modular nature of the solution (Amazon Nova, tools, knowledge base, and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation) means each piece can be swapped or adjusted without overhauling the whole system. Solution architects can use this reference architecture as a foundation, implementing customizations as needed. You can seamlessly integrate new capabilities through AWS Lambda functions for specialized operations, and the LangGraph orchestration enables dynamic model selection and sophisticated routing logic. This architectural approach makes sure the system can evolve organically while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Bringing it to production requires thoughtful design, but AWS offers scalability, security, and reliability. For instance, you can secure the knowledge base content with encryption and access control, integrate the agent with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to make sure it only performs allowed actions (for example, if an agent can access sensitive financial data, verify it checks user permissions ), and monitor the costs (you can track Amazon Bedrock pricing and tools usage; you might use Provisioned Throughput for consistent high-volume usage). Additionally, with AWS, you can scale from an experiment in a notebook to a full production deployment when you’re ready, using the same building blocks (integrated with proper AWS infrastructure like Amazon API Gateway or Lambda, if deploying as a service). The architecture we described is quite general. Let’s briefly look at how this multimodal agentic workflow can drive value in different industries: These examples highlight a common pattern: the synergy of data automation, powerful multimodal models, and agentic orchestration leads to solutions that closely mimic a human expert’s assistance. The financial AI assistant cross-checks figures and explanations like an analyst would, the clinical AI assistant correlates images and notes like a diligent doctor, and the industrial AI assistant recalls diagrams and logs like a veteran engineer. All of this is made possible by the underlying architecture we’ve built. The era of siloed AI models that only handle one type of input is drawing to a close. As we’ve discussed, combining multimodal AI with an agentic workflow unlocks a new level of capability for enterprise applications. In this post, we demonstrated how to construct such a workflow using AWS services: we used Amazon Nova as the core AI orchestrator with its multimodal, agent-friendly capabilities, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation to automate the ingestion and indexing of complex data (documents, slides, audio) into Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, and the concept of an agentic workflow graph for reasoning and condition (using LangChain or LangGraph) to orchestrate multi-step reasoning and tool usage. The end result is an AI assistant that operates much like a diligent analyst: researching, cross-checking multiple sources, and delivering insights—but at machine speed and scale.The solution demonstrates that building a sophisticated agentic AI system is no longer an academic dream—it’s practical and achievable with today’s AWS technologies. By using Amazon Nova as a powerful multimodal LLM and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation for multimodal data processing, along with frameworks for tool orchestration like LangGraph (or Amazon Bedrock Agents), developers get a head start. Many challenges (like OCR, document parsing, or conversational orchestration) are handled by these managed services or libraries, so you can focus on the business logic and domain-specific needs. The solution presented in the BDA_nova_agentic sample notebook is a great starting point to experiment with these ideas. We encourage you to try it out, extend it, and tailor it to your organization’s needs. We’re excited to see what you will build—the techniques discussed here represent only a small portion of what’s possible when you combine modalities and intelligent agents.

Title: Tesla shares pop 10% as Elon Musk touts ‘successful’ Robotaxi test launch in Texas
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/business/tesla-shares-pop-10-as-elon-musk-touts-successful-robotaxi-test-launch-in-texas/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T16:16:35Z
Full Content:
Tesla’s Robotaxis appeared to violate local traffic laws by exceeding the speed limit and swerving into the wrong lane – even as Elon Musk touted a “successful” launch of his long-delayed self-driving vehicles and shares popped as much as 11% Monday. In one video posted by investor Rob Maurer, a Robotaxi appeared to struggle navigating a left-turn-only lane, briefly crossing over a double yellow line before returning to the proper lane. A human motorist honked at the Robotaxi during the glitch. Meanwhile, Tesla investor and superfan Sawyer Merritt posted a video from his Robotaxi ride in which the driverless car accelerated past 30 mph speed limit during Sunday’s rollout in Austin, Texas. YouTuber Herbert Ong described a similar experience in his video, according to Bloomberg. “It’s going at 39 right now, which is perfect, right, because I don’t want to drive at 35, and it’s driving at the same flow of traffic,” Ong said in the video. “If everyone else is driving at this speed, you want to be at the same speed.” Bloomberg later reported the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking information from Tesla after seeing the online videos of issues on robotaxi after its debut. Despite the apparent hiccups, Tesla shares surged after a handpicked group of influencers who participated in the trial run uploaded positive reviews on X and other social media platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, raved about his experience after taking two approximately 15-minute rides in the state capital. “Going into it, we expected to be impressed but walking away from it, all there is to say is that this is the future,” Ives said in a note to clients. “The ride itself was completely smooth, and it was indistinguishable that the car was driverless as there was never a moment in the vehicle where we felt as if it did something irrational.” Ives maintained his “outperform” rating for Tesla’s stock and a $500 price target. The electric car maker began offering driverless rides by invitation only on Sunday, with riders charged a $4.20 flat fee — a cheeky nod to marijuana use. About 10 driverless Tesla Model Y SUVs were reportedly on the road, with company “safety monitors” on board in the front seat to oversee the trips. Bearded Tesla Guy, a social media influencer, compared the experience to “basically Uber.” Farzad Mesbahi, a former Tesla employee-turned influencer, said his rides were “very smooth and comfortable.” “Now Tesla needs to scale this service safely,” Mesbahi said on X. “As long as the system performance holds, they should be able to cover the US with Robotaxis virtually overnight.” Robotaxi is set to directly compete with Google-owned Waymo and Amazon-backed Zoox in the autonomous vehicle market. Tesla told US regulators that all of its answers to questions on the safety of its robotaxi deployment in Texas are confidential business information and should not be made public, according to a letter released Monday. On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was reviewing answers given in response to the agency’s questions about the safety of its self-driving robotaxi in poor weather among other issues. The agency said Monday that federal law “restricts NHTSA’s ability to publicly release what the companies label as confidential.” The agency added that “following an assessment of these responses and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.” On Sunday, Musk shared “super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!” “Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. Invitations circulated by Tesla said the initial Robotaxi service would be available from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM local time and limited to a geofenced area, meaning anything outside the pre-set boundaries would be off-limits. Tesla also said Robotaxi service would be limited or unavailable in the event of bad weather. Musk has long touted the potential of Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” technology, though federal regulators and other critics have repeatedly raised safety concerns. He has suggested that autonomous driving technology can add $5 trillion to $10 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization by transforming its vehicles into an instant productive fleet. The billionaire had said the Robotaxi rollout was limited because Tesla was “being super paranoid about safety.” The debut occurred at a critical time for Tesla, whose shares have been under pressure since Musk embarked on his controversial work with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and Trump had a very public falling-out earlier this month, though the two have since appeared to mend fences. With Post wires Advertisement

[Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024.

During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Young Investor Demand for Alternative Assets Is Reshaping Wall Street's Playbook

The financial industry is rushing to keep up with millennials' and Gen Z's interest in pre-IPO unicorns, real estate, crypto, collectibles and more. June 23, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street has a new favorite investor. They’re young, they’re affluent and they’re skeptical that traditional markets can deliver wealth over the long haul. Shaped by financial crises and fueled by tech optimism, this well-heeled class of Millennials and Gen Z are moving their money into the buzzy world of alternative assets. Think pre-IPO unicorns, real estate, crypto, collectibles, and more. From private banks to fintech platforms, the financial industry is rushing to keep up. Firms like Forge Global Holdings Inc. have lowered their minimum investment thresholds, pitching private-market access as aspirational — and attainable. At Bank of America Corp., the number of retail clients holding alternative assets has more than doubled since 2020, and the firm adds about 50 new funds to its platform each year. Nearly three-quarters of wealthy investors under 43 believe a traditional stock-bond portfolio will fail to generate above-average returns, according to BofA’s biennial study last year. About 93% plan to increase allocations to alternatives in the coming years. The irony for Wall Street’s old guard: many in this alt-loving crowd are turning away from the very public markets that helped build their wealth in the first place. Related:Carlyle Makes New Retail Fund Push to Buy and Sell PE Stakes “Investor preferences are changing at the same time that the markets are evolving,” said Michael Pelzar, head of investments at Bank of America Private Bank. “Those two dynamics are at play that are feeding off of each other.” The demand is reshaping how Wall Street pitches wealth-generating products. What used to be institutional is now increasingly being redesigned for individuals, albeit the well-connected and well-funded. Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. are among investment firms repackaging their once-elite strategies for the masses into ETFs and semi-liquid funds. The 60/40 model — allocating 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds — delivered respectable gains over much of the past decade. But its appeal has dimmed since 2022’s inflation-driven rout, as both assets began moving in lockstep, eroding the diversification benefit of the strategy. “Some advisors may have just used the 60/40 portfolio over time and haven’t really felt the need to offer something in the way of alternatives,” said Mark Steffen, global alternative investment strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “But I think that’s probably changing.” Supply is on the rise. A CAIS survey shows 80% of alternative managers plan to launch retail-friendly products and structures, nearly double from three years ago. Morgan Stanley, for instance, just filed to offer a multi-asset vehicle designed to provide exposure to everything from venture capital to private debt, real estate and infrastructure — all in one fund. Related:CAIS Adds First Models from BlackRock, Carlyle, KKR and Franklin Templeton Many investors are opting into complex, costly, and often illiquid structures — even as the long-term payoff remains uncertain. Compared to tax-efficient ETFs, these alternative products tend to carry higher fees, greater opacity, and less liquidity. Blackstone’s flagship real-estate trust, for example, hit withdrawal limits during the 2022 interest-rate spike. With private equity and credit poised to trail public markets for a third year, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists recently advised their clients to reduce exposure to both assets. A separate academic study has labeled alts “costly and wasteful.” And Moody’s Corp. warned the push to open private markets to the retail crowd carries “systemic implications,” such as growing liquidity risks. Yet none of this is deterring industry fans in the era of get-rich-quick antics amplified on social media from TikTok to Reddit. “I can tell you it’s most often easier to convince an entrepreneur to put money into a 1-in-10 shot startup than it is to get them to park money in a conservative, long-term strategy,” said Brian Werner, chief investment officer at Winthrop Partners. Related:Advisors Say Liquidity, Limited Options Block Greater Alts Adoption Earlier this year, when Forge cut the minimum investment on selected offerings to $5,000, daily sign-ups more than tripled. Executives say the surge largely came from young users riding the AI wave — hoping to access firms like OpenAI before an IPO. Part of the appeal is cultural FOMO — the chance to signal early participation in the next major tech boom. “A lot of them have a tech background, so they’re playing in their own sandbox with stuff that they know,” said Andrew Saeta, co-head of US capital markets at Forge. “The stocks-and-bonds model of our parents isn’t necessarily getting the job done in their eyes, especially with everything being so expensive.” While the trend appears most pronounced among Millennial and Gen Z types, it’s pulling in a broader cohort. Chad Blackburn, an accounting executive in Nashville, Tennessee, started buying equities in his teens. Today, the 45-year-old largely avoids stocks and bonds, putting most of his capital into startup firms and — yep — Bitcoin. “The dotcom bubble and great financial crisis forced me to think more deeply about my investments,” he said. “Why would I limit myself to just stocks and bonds, especially when a lot of this stuff is not nearly as diversified as you think?” For many, alts aren’t just about returns, they’re a form of rebellion. Even among those who have benefited from the market’s gains, there’s a lingering distrust in the institutions that helped deliver them. They view public markets and 60/40 strategies as fragile or even rigged, having coming of age during the crashes of 2008 and 2020. Real estate, digital currencies, and private equity now rank among the top picks for this emerging wealth class, according to BofA. The appeal is both psychological and financial: these assets are seen as detached from government interference and more likely to deliver big upside. “They think, the system is rigged against me,” said Owen Lamont, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management. “I have to do something out of the box in order to get rich.” Read more Wall Street Has a Hot Way to Sell Private Assets to the Masses Apollo, Franklin to Offer Private Assets in Empower 401(k)s Blackstone, Vanguard, Wellington to Launch Private Markets Fund One reason that alternatives are being aggressively repackaged for individuals is that traditional buyers — pensions, endowments, insurers — risk being tapped out. Big institutions allocate about one-fifth of their portfolios to alternatives, according to Preqin. By contrast, individuals in the BofA survey show an allocation of only 7%. But painting alternatives with a broad brush can be misleading. According to Chris Toomey, managing director at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, private credit and infrastructure appeal to older investors thanks to the promise of steady cash flows, though for the young cohort, private equity looks more attractive. “They are at a point in their investment cycle where they have the ability to take on that risk,” Toomey said. “They’re early investors and they’ve got a much longer time horizon.” Yet even among the younger generation, the shift in taste isn’t universal. For every investor chasing unicorns on Forge, there are thousands of Millennial and Gen Z savers. According to Vanguard Group Inc., many in this group are sitting on high cash holdings thanks to cash-default IRAs — at the expense of fully investing their capital in diversified portfolios. There’s no monolithic investor and no single truth about alternatives. But the future of wealth management won’t resemble the past — and Wall Street is already rushing to profit from the generational shift. “You’ve got this mix of investor preferences and product availability evolving in a way that they actually compliment each other to create this procyclical uptake in alternative investments,” said BofA’s Pelzar. “We’re probably in the early innings of a real wave.” Lu Wang You May Also Like Celebrating outstanding achievement in support of financial advisor success Jun 26, 2025 Jun 25, 2025 Jun 18, 2025 Sponsored Content Serving the whole client: Why ignoring estate planning is bad for business Sponsored Content The 2025 WealthStack Study: How Technology Is Transforming Wealth Management Growth and Reshaping the Industry Sponsored Content Open Finance in Action: How Data Connectivity Drives Advisory Value Sponsored Content Modernizing Wealth Stewardship | How Trust & Wealth Managers Are Adapting to HNW Family Expectations Featured WMIQ Research Tracking investment and wealth management decision-makers’ views and progress on data modernization.

Title: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod says dating AI chatbots is ‘playing with fire’

The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. Today, I’m talking with Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod. Hinge is one of the biggest dating apps in the United States — it’s rivaled only by Tinder, and both are owned by the massive conglomerate Match Group, which has consolidated a huge chunk of the online dating ecosystem. A fair warning here: I’ve never actually used a dating app — the algorithm that matched my wife and me was the university housing lottery, which put us in adjacent dorm rooms in the fall of 2000. And my wife is now a divorce lawyer, so playing around with these apps seems a little bit risky. So I always end up approaching conversations about dating apps a little bit removed. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! I asked Justin what it’s like to be the married CEO of a dating app company who doesn’t use his own product anymore, especially as his own personal romantic journey is very intertwined with Hinge. The entire idea of the company and how it has evolved over the years connects to Justin’s own life and his decision to reconnect with his college girlfriend, just a month before she was supposed to marry someone else. The story is so unbelievable that it was turned into an episode of Netflix’s Modern Love. You’ll hear Justin explain how that experience connects to the company’s values, culture, and his vision of what Hinge is really for — and how all of that is geared toward helping people find lasting connections. Hinge bills itself as the app that’s “designed to be deleted,” and that, of course, is in deep tension with how mobile apps and services grow users and revenue. Then there is the AI of it all. Hinge, as part of Match Group, is using AI both internally and within its product, just as Tinder and other competitors are. There’s AI coaching features to help you improve your profile, pick better photos, and even catch an inappropriate message before it gets sent. But pull the string on all these ideas, and you get to a place where people might be talking to AI all the time, even falling in love with it, or having AI agents dating each other before meeting in person. Justin had some pretty strong feelings about the importance of centering real human connection and encouraging people to put their phones down and go out on dates in the real world. Justin also called the idea of AI companionship “playing with fire” and compares those relationships to junk food. There’s a lot more in this conversation. We got on the topic of the Trump administration and how seriously Hinge takes the privacy of its users’ data during an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights. We talked briefly about Apple and its App Store restrictions, now that companies like Epic Games and Match Group are free to send people to the web to process in-app purchases. Hinge has some plans that you’ll hear Justin get into near the end. There’s a lot going on in this one; you might even fall in love. Okay: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Justin McLeod, you’re the founder and CEO of Hinge. Welcome to Decoder. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to talk to you. I’ve got to tell you, this is one where I feel like Jane Goodall or a sociologist of some kind. I’m old. I’m married to a divorce lawyer. I can’t even download this app. It’s too risky. I’m watching through the looking glass here. I asked my younger staff for their Hinge feature requests. Don’t worry, I’ve got a million of those. Great. Excited to hear those. When TaskRabbit comes on Decoder, I’m like, “I booked a TaskRabbit.” This is very different. When was the last time you actually used Hinge as a user? Over a decade ago. Wow. Yeah. What’s that like? What’s it like trying to run this team? Is it all just data driven for you, because there’s a real element of dogfooding here. Yes, definitely. We have a lot of single people on our team at Hinge, so there’s a lot of internal dogfooding for sure, and a lot of opinions. I think that the relationship is different. So, I started the company in 2011, and I was single at the time, and I was single for the first four years of Hinge, and then, long story: I got back together with my college girlfriend, and we’ve been together for the last 10 years, married with kids and all. Did you get back together on Hinge? We were together. I tried to get her back. She said no. I started Hinge in response to that. And then someone whom I met on Hinge inspired me to go back. She was about to get married to someone else. She was living in Switzerland. I flew over a month before the wedding. She called off her wedding and moved back to New York, which led to the whole reboot of Hinge. The whole story is very interconnected. I feel like I should throw out my questions. We should just do an episode of Call Her Daddy or something like that. That sounds very complicated. Yeah, it’s been a ride. An incredible ride, and very intertwined with Hinge. But back to your question, I think that we can overweight our own personal experience a bit, especially as the CEO of the company. What I found over time is that people have a wide array of very diverse experiences, and to some extent, I think it actually helps that I’m not in there overweighting my own niche feature requests that would matter to me but not to the whole population. So the app has evolved. It’s more about helping others than it is about helping myself, which was probably the original idea of Hinge. How do you think about the connection between what the data is telling you, the data about what Gen Z daters are doing versus millennial daters, which is the cohort you started with, versus the very emotional experiences people have on this platform, which are out of your control? Eventually, you’ve got to take the meat sack to the bar and look at the other person and not fuck it up, right? Hinge can’t solve that problem, but that’s the heart of the whole enterprise. How do you connect those two in your brain? This is a very complex, nuanced industry. I think sometimes people look at their Hinge feed and they’re like, “Why doesn’t this understand my taste as well as my TikTok feed does?” People don’t quite understand that people aren’t products; they’re not infinite copies of everyone.They don’t always behave the same. Your videos on TikTok don’t have to like you back. There’s just a lot of nuance to getting this right. And you’re right. A fair amount of this comes down to the people on the platform. So what we’re trying to do is to [not only] build a great product but also an environment and a community where people are encouraged to be intentional and authentic, and attract users who are looking to find their person. So that’s definitely the art and the nuance of trying to build a dating app like ours. One of my big criticisms of social media apps right now in 2025 is they’ve all become marketing platforms in some way. At the end of the rainbow, Mr. Beast is trying to sell you an energy bar. That’s what they’re for. And smaller creators are trying to get their first-brand deals or whatever. But there’s a real organization around just marketing. And the platforms try to encourage people to create content for a whole number of reasons, but their reason for being is advertising spend, and then a lot of the content creation on the platform happens for marketing purposes. You can just see how it goes. Hinge and other dating apps are different. You’re trying to incentivize content creation. You’re trying to get people to talk about themselves, to talk to each other. The goal is to market yourself. How do you divorce that from the actual thing you’re trying to do, which is to have people fall in love and get into stable relationships? Well, it’s very much about what you’re optimizing for. And you’re right; social media is ultimately optimizing for engagement, retention, and time in app. That is the lifeblood of any of these companies. How long can they keep you sucked in? That is their objective, and so everything is built around that. And we’ve seen what the consequences of that are. They’re pretty dire. I think Hinge is almost the polar opposite of that. We’re trying to get you to spend less time on your phone and more time out in real life on dates. It’s interesting. When I started Hinge back in 2011, as venture capitalists looked at our business they asked those questions around engagement and retention. They were looking at social media, and they’re like, “What’s your daily over monthly? How much time are people spending in the app? How many sessions per day?” We were optimizing for those things, because that’s what VCs were asking about. That’s how we were raising money. Then Hinge did a pretty big pivot in 2015, when I let go of half the company and we rebooted from scratch, because we felt as if we’d really lost our way. We’d become more of a piece of entertainment that was just about getting people more matches and more activity, and getting them back every day. We’d lost sight of what we were trying to do, which was to have people come to us to find a relationship. We weren’t really optimized around that anymore. When we did that pivot in 2015, the biggest change we made was to stop focusing on the competition. We started focusing on the customer, and we made our North Star metric actual great dates. We introduced the “We Met” survey, where we asked people we suspected had gone on a date if they did in fact go on that date and whether it was good. Everything became oriented toward optimizing for that. That ended up creating a very, very different experience. That actually became the primary differentiator of Hinge. A lot of the other apps in the industry were based on engagement and retention and just getting people back; they were more like entertainment platforms. Hinge became a utility. We started growing through word of mouth, and today we’re the fastest-growing, and in fact the only growing, major dating app. We grew 40 percent last year, while other dating apps are shrinking, because we built a very sustainable business model that delivers on value. The lifeblood of our company is getting more users out on dates, so they tell their friends and then their friends come and join Hinge. The interesting thing about that business model is it’s in the tagline of the company. I always laugh when you all put out a press release, because it says, “Hinge, the app designed to be deleted,” and then a little trademark logo follows every time it’s mentioned, which is just very funny. I appreciate that you have to do it, but it just makes me laugh every time. That means you’re trying to graduate users. You’re a utility, you pay until you’re done, and then you’re out. Yeah, precisely. It means you constantly have to find new users. You basically have a different churn problem. How do you think about that life cycle? We think about it in terms of good churn. We want people turning off the app for the right reason. We don’t want people turning off the app because they gave up too early or because they don’t like Hinge. We want people turning off the app because they found someone, ideally on Hinge. What does it mean to find somebody on Hinge? Like you’re married? You’ve gone on three dates? It’s different for different people. When we did the reboot, our core market was definitely 25- to 35-year-olds, and very much people who were, I would say, looking to find their person and get off the app. Now our fastest-growing segment has been 18- to 25-year-olds, and they’re at a different phase in their lives. It was pretty interesting. When we saw that segment starting to grow, it came as almost a surprise to us. I think what attracted these younger daters wasn’t so much a focus on finding a long-term relationship, or a marriage partner today; it was very much about the authenticity and vulnerability and intimacy they found on Hinge, and a moving away from platforms that felt very gamified and flat to something that felt very human and intentional and authentic. So we think about our daters as having a journey mindset. They’re headed in a direction, they’re on a journey of self-exploration. They don’t want to waste their time on bad dates, but they aren’t necessarily looking for their marriage partner today, and that’s totally fine. We’re just looking to help people get off the app and out on great dates, and form intimate connections in real life. But there’s a difference between getting off the app and going on great dates, and then deleting the entire thing, right? Forever, yes. There’s one exit ramp that is very different from another exit ramp. Not to keep comparing it to social media, but again, I feel as if I’m just viewing this from the outside, so it’s all metaphors for me. Mark Zuckerberg is terrified that young audiences will just abandon his core app, or whatever the core social media dynamic is at the time. This is why he bought Instagram. You can read his emails over the course of these trials. He’s like, “There’s another mechanic. I need to buy it before they overtake us.” Zuckerberg keeps going down the line, whether that’s Stories or Reels or whatever the next thing is. You have the same problem, only you don’t get to keep the old users on the old mechanic. You don’t get to run Facebook and buy Instagram. How do you think about reinventing the app for that new, younger cohort that has different dynamics on the internet? We always stay in tune with where the culture’s going. I think it’s just imperative, because, you’re right, we can’t rely on only a legacy user base. So we have to stay on top of culture and where it’s going, and then continually evolve the app accordingly. Right now, a big focus is on AI, and how we can increase the effectiveness of the app in a couple of different dimensions. We’re actually finding, for example, the extent to which coaching has become really, really important right now. Especially during the pandemic, we saw social skills atrophy. People felt less comfortable meeting up with others in real life and interacting. So we’re helping people create their profiles, write their prompts, things like that. Another big thing that came out during the pandemic was more of a focus on voice, and adding voice prompts, which I think is, again, an example of our moving where the culture goes. So we’re always making these kinds of tweaks to continually keep the app fresh. Do you feel the same existential pressure? There’s this idea that some cohort of people will delete the app — the old millennials will be married or tired or whatever it is they’re going to do, and you’ve got to go get a bunch of new Gen Z users or Gen Alpha users, which is frankly terrifying. How do you think about, “Okay, we’ve got to break the old model, because it’s existential for us if we don’t capture the younger user,” or is it more of a gradation? If you look at the relatively brief history of this industry starting in the ‘90s, there’s only been one major disruption moment, which was around 2012. So you had the birth of the industry in the late ‘90s, where you had Match and eHarmony come on the scene, and then they dominated from 1996 to about 2014. It was actually a much smaller niche industry at the time. The users were older, people who felt as if they’d really struggled to find someone in real life. Then you had the mobile dating apps come on because of a few different technologies that started to come online all together — one was mobile, one was the cultural change of everyone having a social media account. Another was data-processing power and moving away from the world of searching for people to a world of a feed of relevant people, one after another. That created a pretty big paradigm shift, where suddenly technology enabled an entirely new type of experience that it was hard for the old incumbents to mirror. They tried to pivot to mobile, but they couldn’t unseat themselves from their way of thinking about the world. It resembles a very classic disruption problem. I think the next opportunity for that kind of disruption is going to be a big technology shift. We haven’t seen that up until very recently. Like with VR, AR, and other technologies like that, I just don’t see those working until they’re deeply adopted by 70 percent to 80 percent of the population, and that’s when I think it will really become something that people start using for dating. AI I think is a very different story, and it’s unclear at this point whether it becomes a disruptive force for the current players or whether it becomes more of an evolution. Obviously, Hinge has a tremendous amount of data we can use to train AI models. We’re seeing huge gains in our ability to match people up more thoughtfully given the tools, and at the same time we could introduce very new paradigms for dating. I want to talk about AI with you, but you mentioned Match, so I think this is a good time to get to the Decoder questions. You’re part of Match Group. You sold to Match Group, and now Match Group owns all of the dating apps minus one, which is a little contentious. It doesn’t own Bumble. There’s a lawsuit. We can set that aside. What’s it like being part of Match Group? When you sold your company, what was that decision like for you? Honestly, at the time we were in a tough position as a company. I’d done the reboot, and we were about a year into that reboot experience, and we had not really cracked the code yet. There were green shoots there that made me believe and made, I would say, the trained eye believe that there was really something there. But VCs just saw that we were popular, and then we tore down our business, and we restarted, and we started to rebuild again. There wasn’t a lot of juice there. So we went with a strategy of recognizing the value of what we were seeing, including massive increases in effectiveness, women coming to the platform in a much higher proportion than on other dating apps. So that was very interesting to Match. And so we received a strategic investment from the company in 2017, and that gave it a path to buy the rest of the company, which it did at the end of 2018. What’s that structure like inside of Match Group now? It’s evolving. There’s a brand-new CEO, Spencer Rascoff, who just started, and I think he’s taking a fresh look at some of that. But up until recently, and still today, the company operates pretty independently. We’re in New York. We pretty much have our own space. We have our own product teams, our own engineering teams, our own marketing teams that operate very independently. We share learnings across the platform. We use shared services like accounting and legal and things like that. But for the most part, the company has its own independent culture, its own independent mission, product road maps, marketing strategies, all of that. You said you shared some central services, like accounting and finance. Is there any product or data that you’re sharing? We certainly share learnings. Especially on things that we don’t really want to compete on, such as safety or monetization or things like that. So there’s certainly that, and there’s sharing for safety purposes. Those are the main ways we share. So if you’re a young and carefree single on Tinder, and you graduate to Hinge, you don’t get to just bring your data along for the ride? [Laughs] No. Again, I’m just looking from the outside. Tinder is interesting. The CEO of Tinder just stepped down. Your new CEO at Match, Spencer, stepped in to run Tinder for a minute. In any normal circumstance, you would be on the attack. If Tinder wasn’t part of the same company as you, this would be a moment to say, “Okay, there’s some strategic weakness over there. We’re going to go get them. We’re going to put the screws on.” Are you allowed to do that inside Match Group? So first of all, I’ll just say that we don’t really think too much about Tinder as Hinge’s competition. We think about Tinder in a very different psychographic mindset. You come to Hinge because you want to really take your time, be intentional, be thoughtful, find your person. Tinder has a much more casual, younger, “anything can happen” mentality. And so that was a very intentional portfolio strategy decision that Match made back when it acquired us. So no, we don’t think about it like that. That’s why I asked about the data and the lifecycle question. There’s a time in your life where you might use Tinder, there’s a time in your life where you might use Hinge. It seems from the overall umbrella company perspective, you want to move that user around your family of apps, but it doesn’t seem as if that’s actually happening at the top level. Yes. From the outside that would make sense. It’s a bit nuanced, because there are very different brand reputations. We like to think of Hinge pretty independently, and I think so do our users. So there’s no pop-up on Tinder that’s like, “Maybe, it’s time to cool it and download Hinge”? There’s not. [Laughs] Okay, feature request for you. What’s your org chart like? How is Hinge structured? That’s also been evolving over time, and we’re still a relatively small company. We have about 350 employees. If I think about the evolution of Hinge growing from one person to the first 100 to 150 people, originally, it was very centrally run. There was tight coordination. A lot of direction came directly from me and my executive team. Then as we started to grow beyond 100 people, I would say a lot of the technology was relatively stable. Like with social, mobile, big data, the question became, “How do we keep optimizing and iterating around this?” We became a pretty decentralized organization, where we had principles around pushing decision-making down to the lowest levels possible, keeping it really on the front lines. We had pretty independent cross-functional product teams that would work on their individual little missions or surfaces. We oscillated back and forth between that. People felt they had a lot of autonomy. That was the main ethos of the company. And then I think with AI over the last couple of years, we felt like, “Whoa, we really need to make a pretty big shift.” Like I said, the risk of disruption is high, with very big opportunities to shift the product experience in a new direction. It now requires pulling decision-making back in toward the center a bit, and giving a much clearer strategic direction to the team, so that we’re all working in concert toward one thing. Because the whole app really has to move together. Different parts of the app have to talk to each other in ways that when we weren’t going through much change, wasn’t as essential. That said, we still have very highly cross-functional product teams where product managers sit with a dedicated designer, researcher, data scientist, and tech lead to attack very mission-oriented problems. You mentioned “surfaces” and “missions.” Are those expressed as just the tabs at the bottom of the app? Is that how they’re broken down, or are they actual user journey missions? That’s what I mean — surfaces versus missions. I think we’ve gone in different directions. There’s never really a clear line of one versus the other. Do you own the Discover tab, where users just discover new people, or is your job to help people find the right person? In that case, you have to think more cohesively about operating across different surfaces or parts of the app. Now we think about our teams operating less as individual surface units and more as part of a cohesive dating-outcomes team, where people feel a bit more flexible moving around to different surfaces. How do you think about assigning product managers to those teams? Because PMs, at least in my experience, are like, “I own this square, and I will mess with this square to make this number go up as much as I can.” But “I can mess with all the squares” is really hard, right? Yes, that’s why we have strong directors at the VP level who oversee an overall mission the way that a head of dating outcomes or a head of growth, who’s coordinating a set of product managers, would. And again, we ask our PMs. Their primary identity is as a dating outcomes PM, not as a discover PM, or a profile PM, or something like that. And while day to day most of their work may focus on the profile and identity work, they see themselves as very much operating as part of this team. That feels like something you evolved to. You’re a relatively young founder. I think you founded the company right out of Harvard Business School. How has your decision-making framework evolved? How do you make decisions? That’s also hugely evolved. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned through doing it all the wrong ways first and then eventually getting to the right way. When you’re a founder and you have a small team of 10, 20, or 30 people, you’re just making decisions by the seat of your pants. What feels good? What feels right? You’re just using your own gut. As we started to get toward 100 people or so, what I noticed was I would be making different decisions on different days that weren’t always consistent. They were based on my mood that day or whatever data was in front of me or what I had last read or whatever. I was just finding I was getting pretty inconsistent. So what I started trying to do was to write down my whole management algorithm. I started putting it in a Google Doc, like “Here’s how I make decisions, here’s what I believe is true.” I started publishing that to the whole company, so everyone could just read it. We would be just very transparent about how we made decisions. It was around the time that I think I read Ray Dalio’s book Principles, and got super dialed in on how we make decisions. What are our principles, and what do we believe is true? Then I opened it up so everyone could comment on it. We would have long debates in the comment margins of a Google Doc to consider everything from our product-strategy principles to whether Hinge should have a dress code. Literally anything. It was all just there so that everyone could debate it. We had hundreds of principles, and then as the company got even bigger and we got to 300 or 400 people, it was very hard. One, you just can’t have these endless debates in Google Docs anymore. Also, the principles started to stabilize. There wasn’t as much debate and churn anymore, and then it actually became an exercise in distilling down the most essential things to communicate about our culture. I worked a couple of years ago to write an internal book called How We Do Things, which distilled it all down to four or five principles. For example, what are the most fundamental things to understand about how we make decisions here? And then individual teams and individual projects would then write their own principles that were more specific to what they were doing at any given time. One of our meta principles now is “decide with principles,” meaning that we don’t want decisions getting made based on some random person’s opinion that if tomorrow this person leaves the company and we hire someone else, they’re going to come in with a completely different set of ideas about how to do something. We really try to define our principles first, agree on those principles, and then see how our work maps to them. I’m happy to talk about what the other three principles are if you want, but that’s the framework we use to make decisions now. Yeah, talk about them a little bit. There’s a beautiful website, we’ll link to it. It has storytelling, it’s well done. But tell people what the other three principles are. So the next one is “love the problem.” What I would notice is we would get an inclination around a user problem, which maybe was not even validated 100 percent. Then we’d start getting feature ideas, and we’d get very attached to a feature, and sometimes the feature would drift and not even be solving the original problem. What I found was, if you want to build breakthrough innovative product features and products, you have to spend extra time with the problem to really understand the why behind the why behind the why of of it. You need to ask, “What’s really going on here? Can we really get deep into our users, into the data, into our users’ experiences?” You have to go to that level to get insight that just isn’t available on the surface, and then stay really committed to that problem. And that’s what, again, allows for innovation. I think for a lot of Silicon Valley, the strategy is just to throw feature ideas against a wall and see what sticks: “Let’s see if this works. Oh, it doesn’t work, throw that out, let’s try something else.” When you have a lot of deep conviction around a user problem, and you really know you want to solve it, then you have the resilience to try and try again to solve that problem, even if your first or second iteration doesn’t make it. So one of the most foundational of our principles is, “love the problem.” Fall in love with the problem, don’t fall in love with the solution, as you must be willing to give up the solution at any given time if it’s not solving the core problem that you’re trying to solve. So that is “love the problem.” Next is “keep it simple,” meaning that I think the best solutions are always the most elegant solutions. Overall, we want to keep the product very simplified and minimal. Our colors are black and white. If you look at the Hinge product today, it’s very clean, it’s very simple. We’re always stripping away features that don’t make sense and just recognizing that there’s complexity. There’s a cost to complexity every time you add a feature. So even if you add a feature, if it’s only marginally beneficial, the cost of the complexity and maintaining that feature versus the marginal benefit it adds will end up gunking up the app over time and slowing you down over time. That’s a hard conversation to have with product managers, because they’ll work for months on a feature and they’ll ship it and say, “Yeah, it didn’t harm the user base, we like it, and it even moved this metric over here by 2 percent.” And you’re like, “Well, the cost of complexity is high, and so we need to focus on things that are actually going to have a major impact.” Are you all the way two features out for every feature in? Do you think about it that way? I know some founders do. I haven’t heard that before. I don’t necessarily think that way. But I do believe in constantly reevaluating what’s in the app, asking what needs to stay, and having a high bar for building a new feature. So does it actually accomplish what we need it to accomplish, and is the complexity worth the cost? So that’s the third one now. The fourth, the last one, is “tend to trust.” I just find that trust is the lifeblood of an organization. You have to do a lot of work to proactively cultivate and tend to trust by creating strong interpersonal relationships, by creating lots of opportunities for transparency at the organization. We have always been very, very transparent about where the organization is headed. So much so that we had to make all Hinge employees Match Group insiders so they couldn’t trade Match Group stock except during trading windows, because we would be so transparent about where we were, what our financial position was. Everyone should know that all the way down to any position at the company. I think the trust that you create both interpersonally and from the leadership on down to the rest of the organization is absolutely essential. It just saves you a lot of headaches when it comes to internal politics and all those types of things. Let’s put this into practice. You obviously made a big decision to refocus on AI. How did that come about? Did you wake up one day and say, “Oh boy, it’s happening”? Was it that Match Group put out a press release with OpenAI saying, “We’re going to work together”? Did you read that and say, “I got to figure this out”? How did this come about? Certainly the release of whatever version of ChatGPT that sent shockwaves through the world was a pretty big wake-up call. Obviously, we’d already been using machine learning and things like that in the interest of safety, and in our algorithms, our recommendation algorithms. But I think the shot across the bow that came from the release of ChatGPT [with GPT-3.5] was what really woke us up to the potential capabilities here and to realizing that this could be a major disruptive force in a way that we hadn’t really seen since we started Hinge. It took a bit for us to get our strategy clear about what our thesis was on how this was going to affect matching and dating in the future. It wasn’t immediately apparent, but I think we have a pretty clear thesis now, and we’ve started to organize the company around that thesis. What’s the thesis? That there’s two main vectors that AI is going to impact: dating and matchmaking. I think the big story is AI is going to move Hinge much closer to the experience of working with a personalized matchmaking service, and away from the experience of feeling that you are joining a social platform on your own as you try to find your person. So what does that mean? Two big pieces. One is personalized matching, and the other is effective coaching. On the personalized matching front, we should be able to move much further beyond the world we are in today, which is our users speaking to us in essentially Morse code as they try to communicate to us what they like and what they don’t like. The idea is that they would be able to speak much more directly to us with “here’s what I’m looking for, here are my values, here’s my personality, here are my interests.” It means Hinge being able to listen to them and hear their preferences, and even integrate things like relationship science into the app to better understand what types of people are compatible and what types of people are not long-term compatible, and introduce them to a much more curated, higher-quality, less-quantity list of people, where they have much more trust that if you’re introducing them to this person, this is probably someone they want to go out with. We’ve already seen big gains, by the way, just by using the power of LLMs to drive more of our recommendation systems using the data we already have. But we released a new algorithm a couple of months ago that increased matches and dates by like 15 percent, and that’s just using the same data. But now we can start to use much more of that unstructured, nuanced data, with people talking to us in their own voice about who they are and what they want, which we can use very effectively. So that’s the whole personalized matching front. Then there’s the effective coaching front. A lot of our users struggle to get out on that first date, and they often don’t know why. I have friends who are incredible people, and they’ll ask me to take a look at their Hinge profile. I’m flabbergasted that this is their attempt at putting themselves out there. So we’re starting with pretty basic things. Hinge has these prompts, which are short questions designed to get you into a conversation, and you put them on your profile. A lot of people write great responses to prompts, but a lot of people write not-so-great responses, often just one-word answers that just don’t work. We found it’s just incredibly effective to have trained an AI model on good-prompt responses and give people feedback. And it’s mostly like, “Can you say more about that?” [Laughs] Don’t just put “no.” Yeah, and to be a little bit more specific and tell a little bit of the story. Good answers invite another question back, or get a conversation going. So we can give people those nudges so they write good prompts, so that they choose good photos. We have a team called Hinge Labs, which is always looking at why some people succeed, and why some people don’t on the app. Some of it is, again, simply building product features that help solve those problems, but another part of it is just giving guidance and notes about how they can be using the product better. We have traditionally published those in date reports, and we publish them in the press and we place them in the help center. But for the most part people just don’t read them. But the idea that we can take this body of knowledge we have about how to succeed on Hinge, and then look at how our users are using Hinge, and then deliver the right piece of advice at the right time to the right user, I think is going to be pretty transformative for a lot of people. There’s a pretty fine line between that and what I see lots of people already doing all day long, which is just talking to ChatGPT, just hanging out. We had Eugenia Kuyda, the CEO of Replika, on the show, and she said, essentially, “My plan is people are going to date AI bots that will coach them up into being fully formed people, then we’ll release them into the dating pool, and they will have confidence and self-assuredness.” Again, there’s a fine line between prompting someone and coaching them inside Hinge, and we’re coaching them in a different way within a more self-contained ecosystem. How do you think about that? Would you launch a full-on virtual girlfriend inside Hinge? Certainly not. I have lots of thoughts about this. I think there’s actually quite a clear line between providing a tool that helps people do something or get better at something, and the line where it becomes this thing that is trying to become your friend, trying to mimic emotions, and trying to create an emotional connection with you. That I think is really playing with fire. I think we are already in a crisis of loneliness, and a loneliness epidemic. It’s a complex issue, and it’s baked into our culture, and it goes back to before the internet. But just since 2000, over the past 20 years, the amount of time that people spend together in real life with their friends has dropped by 70 percent for young people. And it’s been almost completely displaced by the time spent staring at screens. As a result, we’ve seen massive increases in mental health issues, and people’s loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I think Mark Zuckerberg was just quoted about this, that most people don’t have enough friends. But he said we’re going to give them AI chatbots. That he believes that AI chatbots can become your friends. I think that’s honestly an extraordinarily reductive view of what a friendship is, that it’s someone there to say all the right things to you at the right moment The most rewarding parts of being in a friendship are being able to be there for someone else, to risk and be vulnerable, to share experiences with other conscious entities. So I think that while it will feel good in the moment, like junk food basically, to have an experience with someone who says all the right things and is available at the right time, it will ultimately, just like junk food, make people feel less healthy and mo re drained over time. It will displace the human relationships that people should be cultivating out in the real world. How do you compete with that? That is the other thing that is happening. It is happening. Whether it’s good or bad. Hinge is offering a harder path. So you say, “We’ve got to get people out on dates.” I honestly wonder about that, based on the younger folks I know who sometimes say, “I just don’t want to leave the house. I would rather just talk to this computer. I have too much social pressure just leaving the house in this way.” That’s what Hinge is promising to do. How do you compete with that? Do you take it head on? Are you marketing that directly? I’m starting to think very much about taking it head on. We want to continue at Hinge to champion human relationships, real human-to-human-in-real-life relationships, because I think they are an essential part of the human experience, and they’re essential to our mental health. It’s not just because I run a dating app and, obviously, it’s important that people continue to meet. It really is a deep, personal mission of mine, and I think it’s absolutely critical that someone is out there championing this. Because it’s always easier to race to the bottom of the brain stem and offer people junk products that maybe sell in the moment but leave them worse off. That’s the entire model that we’ve seen from what happened with social media. I think AI chatbots could frankly be much more dangerous in that respect. So what we can do is to become more and more effective and support people more and more, and make it as easy as possible to do the harder and riskier thing, which is to go out and form real relationships with real people. They can let you down and might not always be there for you, but it is ultimately a much more nourishing and enriching experience for people. We can also champion and raise awareness as much as we can. That’s another reason why I’m here today talking with you, because I think it’s important to put out the counter perspective, that we don’t just reflexively believe that AI chatbots can be your friend, without thinking too deeply about what that really implies and what that really means. We keep going back to junk food, but people had to start waking up to the fact that this was harmful. We had to do a lot of campaigns to educate people that drinking Coca-Cola and eating fast food was detrimental to their health over the long term. And then as people became more aware of that, a whole personal wellness industry started to grow, and now that’s a huge industry, and people spend a lot of time focusing on their diet and nutrition and mental health, and all these other things. I think similarly, social wellness needs to become a category like that. It’s thinking about not just how do I get this junk social experience of social media where I get fed outraged news and celebrity gossip and all that stuff, but how do I start building a sense of social wellness, where I can create an enriching, intimate connection with important people in my life. The connection between the wellness industry and the rise of social media is a whole other podcast, and maybe a PhD thesis, too. There’s a whole lot there to unpack. I take your point though, that maybe using our phones in healthier ways is the future. It will make us better, and that will be a reaction to the negativity we see from phones today. Literally as we speak, I’m sure Elon Musk and Donald Trump are continuing to tweet at each other in an unhealthy way for maybe the future of the entire planet. But you’ve got to use AI today. You have prompt feedback running in the app today. You’re helping people pick better photos. The flip side of that is that they might just use AI to generate the content. Can you detect it if your prompt feedback says, “Hey, that’s not a good answer,” and someone runs away to Gemini or ChatGPT and comes up with a better answer that doesn’t actually reflect them? I think about this like the extreme photo filters, which used to be popular on Instagram back in the day. Ultimately, you are going to have to go meet up with this person on a real date, and so you want to come across as best as you can, because, obviously, you’re not going to bring ChatGPT on your date with you. I’m worried about this. I want to say that I’m worried about this. So it’s not a winning strategy. That said, do people ask for advice and little tweaks? They already do it today. They ask their friends, “How should I respond to this text message?” So in some sense, I don’t see it that differently, because you will have to meet up with this person eventually and show up as the real you. Would you add that feedback inside Hinge? Hinge obviously has messaging features. Are you going to add a little coach into the messaging feature to say, “Hey, don’t be a dick”? That already exists. It’s called “Are You Sure?” That’s AI-driven to make sure people don’t send inappropriate messages. But yeah, again, the right nudge at the right time, because I think if we build the right tools within Hinge that are appropriate for dating, people will then use it and be less likely to run out to ChatGPT and use [the feedback] in ways that are probably less appropriate. Nudging people to say, “Hey, you guys have been chatting for a bit. Did you know that most people, after they exchange this many messages, usually just go on and move to a date?” Or, “Hey, it seems like the conversation has died. Here’s something interesting that you may not have noticed on their profile that you can ask about.” Little things like that, certainly. One of the interesting dynamics here is you’ll add more and more AI to the digital experience people have with each other to make them perform better or act better or be more interesting, whatever it is. And then they’ll go on a date, and then they might leave your platform. They might switch to iMessage or call each other on the phone. I don’t think Gen Z is calling each other. They’ll do something else. They’ll go on Discord. How do you bring that experience along for the ride to say, “We’re going to continue to stay here and help mediate and coach you through this relationship”? We’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do just to get people out on the first date. And at the same time, I do think there’s actually a lot of opportunity to help coach people through that experience. How to show up on a first date. What to talk about on a first date. How to build intimacy over time, how to ask about the right things to determine compatibility. So I think there are definitely opportunities for that. It’s not on the 2025 road map, but it’s certainly something I’m thinking about. Do you worry that people are going to just upload full AI avatars on Hinge and catfish each other to death? We have a very robust trust and safety team that is thinking two to three steps ahead about how to mitigate things like that. I have spent too much time talking about watermarks in AI and SynthID, and there’s lots of episodes of the show that are deep in the AI watermarks game, and it has effectively come to nothing so far. There’s just a lot of problems there. Are you able to say, “Okay, we can detect a full AI photo here”? There’s so many signals when it comes to creating a dating profile from the phone number you use and the email you use and your IP address, all those things like that, that we have a very multifaceted way of determining the authenticity of profiles. I’ll say that. Running these models is costly. There’s lots and lots of different kinds of models you can run at different costs. Are you using lots of models? Are you sending everything to GPT-4? How does this work for you? We use different models for different things. Sometimes we build them completely internally. As you said, it’s public that we have a relationship with OpenAI. So we use different things and are always balancing cost and performance against our ability to build in-house versus not. Do you see that trend shifting over time? I’m very curious about what the frontier models can do versus what the cheaper, more efficient models can do. Have you seen that shift over time as you’ve started to deploy these tools? For one, we’ve seen the cost of the frontier models just decline precipitously, which is pretty interesting to watch. But I’ll say that there are models, even the prompt feedback model, that are very, very specific and discrete, and that we can mostly build internally to understand. Do you run that in your cloud and your data center? Or are you running that on people’s phones? I don’t actually know. I think that’s in the cloud. I’m almost positive that one is in the cloud. The reason I’m asking is that to do any of this well, you need more and more data from people, and you’re asking them to generate more and more data. For instance, “That’s not a good answer; tell me more about yourself,” is more data and it’s data that you’re now storing. In particular, it’s data about gender, sexuality, and dating preferences — that’s stuff the government suddenly has a very unusual and somewhat threatening interest in. Are you worried about that? That the Trump administration or some future administration would show up and say, “Tell me all of the transgender people on your platform”? Obviously, we have very, very sensitive data that we have very, very clear protections around. And we haven’t seen anything like that. So you haven’t had any of those incoming requests yet? No. The Trump administration has also said it’s going to start scanning social media profiles for references to Palestine, and for comments about Trump himself. When you talk about matching people and values, those things come up. Has there been any request for Hinge profiles from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE or any of these other parts of the Trump administration that are doing this social media scanning? No. The reason I’m asking is the amount of data you might collect is very, very personal. It seems like a rich target. Have you thought about the planning for how big of a target this might become as you prompt people to input more and more data with AI? Certainly. I think we’ll have to handle those things as they come. We’re obviously in a very uncertain time right now, but I will say that we are primarily a platform about creating intimate one-to-one connections where people should be able to express themselves in the way they see fit, and describe themselves and their own sexuality and their own gender in the way they need to do. That will inevitably touch on people’s very private lives. I view that as absolutely sacred and fundamental to our mission, and people feeling safe to express themselves is absolutely critical. So those would be our very highest priorities, and I imagine not top priority for social media, where people are blasting posts to thousands, or millions, of people. Our platform is not about one-to-many posting and conversation. It’s about intimate one-to-one connection and one-to-one conversations. I think I would warn you that having a data pool of that kind might make you a target. I’m curious how that plays out over time, particularly in this administration. There’s some platform dynamics here as well, like iOS and Android exist. They are platforms. They’re also themselves rich targets for the government. Overall, there’s a push for the platforms to do age verification themselves. There’s laws now in certain states, and in other countries, that the Apples and the Googles of the world have pushed back against in various ways. Do you think they need to do it? Do you think that it’s at the iOS and Android level that you need to do the age verification? Because this is a core component of bringing people onto Hinge. It’s not for children. It’s certainly not. We’re 18-plus and we have our own age verification methods. But yeah, we have been pushing for these platforms to do age verification themselves because they have even more robust ways to do it. The arguments in response — when you listen to Apple and Google push back against these laws — is that it would be too hard. It would create a censorship regime, that the app vendors need to be liable for this. Have you seen any movement in that dynamic? I think at the highest level, this is one of the big dynamics of how we might regulate platforms in the future. I am staying much closer to product development and where we’re going with AI right now than I am to that. Your monetization method is obviously a premium version of Hinge. I think one tier is $55 a month. There’s another tier that’s $45 a month. The big news in the platform world is that Apple is no longer allowed to prevent alternative payment systems. Match Group, in particular, has been leading this fight. It’s in all the press releases. Has that changed the dynamics of Hinge for you? I don’t know if it changes the dynamics, but it’s certainly going to give us more flexibility in giving users options to be able to pay in different ways. I think that’s good for everybody for sure. Have you launched an alternative payment service yet? We have not. Would you like to? Yes. How soon? Certainly by the end of the year. Is that going to be a Match Group payment service or a Hinge payment service? How do you think about that? These are things that we’re figuring out, but most likely Hinge. That would return somewhere on the order of 15 percent to 30 percent depending on how the billing works for you at your scale and recurring subscriptions and all that. Is that just going to be pure margin? You’re just going to get the money back? Well, I think it changes the equation on many fronts. It allows us to invest more in the company. It changes how we would price, so no, I think it could result in lower prices. It could result in more investment in the company, or it could result in more margin. It’s probably some combination of all three of those. Match Group has been doing this fight for a long time, and you’re already describing how you might change pricing or the lifetime value of customers. Fortnite maker Epic Games fought this fight for five years. At the very end, the judge says, “I’m very mad at you, Apple. You can’t do this anymore.” Did you immediately start making plans that day or were you like, “This is going to get appealed, we have to wait”? There’s been back and forth and appeals and stays and things like that. I think just a couple of days ago, the appeal was denied. So I think that made it pretty real. Just to put the decision-making into practice, did you say that day we need an alternative payment system? Certainly the day that the original ruling came out, we started to plan. What does that planning look like? Is it, “I’m going to call Stripe”? Put us in your shoes. That happens. Someone comes to you and you say, “Okay. We need to start to plan.” Walk us through that moment. Just like anything else at Hinge, I think that we stay grounded in our principles. We look at the big picture. We look at the teams and the road maps and the things they’re focused on right now, and we think, “Does this new information change anything? And as we look at our growth team, does it make sense to build the next monetization or expansion feature? Does it make sense to pivot resources over to this thing?” And given, as you said, the 15 percent to 30 percent gain that’s on the table, it’s a pretty high priority. There’s an ecosystem of companies that might be building this stuff more centrally, that might be charging different rates. I’m excited about that. It’s wonky and boring. There’s a reason we’re ending the episode on payment systems. A whole new industry I think will emerge. Well maybe not an industry, but certainly a suite of services will emerge around this to allow people to manage subscription payments, cancellations. It’s certainly nuanced. But at the end of that, what you want is rates to come down. Where do you think the rates should be? I know no one has ever thought they should be at 15 percent or 30 percent. Where do you think they should be with a little more market competition? When you stack the credit card payment processing fees on top of the fees around customer service and all the nuance of managing those, I do think it comes down to the 5 percent to 10 percent range. When you think about recovering that up to 20 percent, are you thinking, “Okay, I can use this to lower prices and grow,” or is it that you have to build many, many more AI features to compete against the coming onslaught of AI chatbots? [Laughs] I think we’re very, very focused on innovating for the future. Like I said, it changes the equation, so it’s on all three fronts. It’s lower prices, it’s higher margin, and it’s more investment in the company. But it certainly gives us major opportunities to invest in the core product experience at a time when there’s massive disruption. So it’s a particularly critical time to be doing that. There’s a lot of talk about platform shifts. You’ve talked about platform shifts here. People might be using Hinge differently, because they have AI tools or because the AI tools are helping them find one another more efficiently, or better. A lot of the platform shift I hear about is, “Oh, we’re going to have new devices. We’re going to have new form factors. People are just going to talk to ChatGPT in the bar.” Maybe we’ll just have agents that represent us, and they’ll go on dates for a while, and come back and say, “You should go on this date with this other person we found on Hinge,” because the agents have fallen in love, and now you just have to not screw it up. That takes the screen away. That takes your surfaces and your missions and puts them in a totally different place. How are you thinking about that level of shift? Is it even on your radar? Yeah, I’m thinking about it right now. I think we overuse the form factor of our mobile devices right now for all kinds of things that it doesn’t need to be used for. I think a lot of those will be siphoned off into some other form factor. I especially think audio and voice is going to be a very big piece of it. But I don’t think that means that the form factor completely goes away. There are things that you need visual cues and references for where a screen is still going to be the dominant form factor. At least a piece of the dating equation is going to be that, for sure. Do you think we’ll get to a place where people’s agents are just dating each other and then reporting back? No, I don’t really think so. I think there are much better– Isn’t that what’s already happening in the matchmaking algorithm, in a very reductive way? Isn’t that what’s going on? I think in a very abstractive, reductive way, you could say that. But that’s not really what’s happening. We are not simulating dates. I think it’s a very expensive and inefficient way to do something that is actually much more straightforward. There’s just a part of me that says you’re going to have some competitor that attempts this, and we will all have to contend with it. I just think that’s a bit of a red herring for trying to map someone’s psyche and guess how they’re going to act. That adds a lot of complexity when actually you can just talk to people very directly about who they are and what they’re looking for and what matters to them, and compare that against someone else and what they describe, and actually make a lot of good connections and [get a] clear understanding in figuring out who should match with whom. Justin, this has been great. Tell people what’s next for Hinge. What should they be looking for? It really is the evolution of the product. I think that the shift to AI is going to be bigger than the shift to mobile for the industry. If you think about the big picture of what mobile did, it just made the process more approachable, faster, more fun, easier. But it was still the same fundamental experience of just cruising for people and trying to find someone based on very limited information, matching with them, trying to figure it out, going on a date, realizing this is not your person, trying to find the next date. We’re moving much closer to a world of really deep understanding of compatibility. Being able to zero in on the right person very quickly. It’s going to be a very transformative experience that I think is going to very much change people’s understanding and perception of the industry. So I’m really looking forward to the next couple of years, because I think that we will see more change than we’ve ever seen in the industry before. We’ll have to have you back to check in on how it’s going. Thanks so much for coming on Decoder. Great. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

Title: Defense And Energy Holdings May Help In New Climate

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A Dassault Rafale C fighter jet. Dassault Aviation is one of 23 stocks currently in my model ... More portfolio. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, with the possibility of retaliation by Iran, poses new risks for U.S. stock investors. With four defense stocks and two energy stocks in my standard portfolio, I feel reasonably well positioned. Once a year in this column, I give a snapshot of my holdings in a typical medium-risk account. My biggest concentration at present is in industrial stocks, most of which are defense stocks. U.S. relations are tense with China, Russia, South Korea and of course Iran. I own Dassault Aviation SA (DUAVF) in France; BAE Systems Plc (BAESY) in Great Britain; and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) in the United States. A quasi-defense holding is Babcock International Group Plc (BCKIY) of Great Britain. Babcock services reactors in nuclear subs, and does other nuclear work. Sterling Infrastructure Inc. (STRL) does engineering and construction, with a specialty in data centers. Its stock is up more than 800% in the past three years. My final industrial holding is Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI), which makes refrigerator coils and other plastic and metal parts. I expect the U.S. stock market to run into some trouble in the next few months, partly because of international strife and rocky federal budget negotiations. Therefore, my second-biggest concentration is in health-care stocks, because the health sector usually holds up pretty well in rough markets. I own Chemed, the largest U.S. hospice operator, and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), a large insurer and operator of medical practices. In pharmaceuticals, I own Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Sanofi SA (SNY) in France, and Novo Nordisk AS (NVO) in Denmark. I’m fairly light in technology stocks – lighter than I want to be, in fact. Most clients have about 5% of their money in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which makes chips for most major semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm and Broadcom. Also weighing in around 5% is Jabil Inc. (JBL), best known for circuit-board assembly. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is classified as a communications services stock, not a tech stock, but it has an undeniable tech flavor. It is the parent of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. I’ve long been a fan of Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), so it’s not surprising that JPMorgan is in my portfolio. I also hold Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group Inc. (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan (which holds a 23% stake in Morgan Stanley). A small holding is First Trust Nasdaq ABA Community Bank Index Fund (QABA), an exchange-traded fund that holds shares in about 100 small and medium-sized banks. I also own Berkshire Hathaway, which is a conglomerate but is classified as a financial stock because of its extensive insurance holdings. This is the domain of Warren Buffett, considered by many the dean of U.S. stock pickers. Buffett has said he will step down as CEO at the end of this year. Among consumer stocks, my biggest holding is Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM), the largest U.S. egg producer. I also own Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH), a mid-sized homebuilder in a fragmented industry. Meritage concentrates on the sunbelt, where growth is faster than in the Northeast. Given my concerns about the market, the federal budget deficit, and the fraught international scene, I think it’s prudent to own some gold now. Most of my clients have about 6% of their money in SPDR Gold Share ETF (GLD), which represents a share in a large pool of physical gold. An old favorite sector of mine is energy. Diamondback Energy Inc. (FANG) is a pure play on the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. TotalEnergies SE (TTE) is the largest oil company in France, and also has significant operations in solar and wind. When I buy a stock, my desired holding period is usually three years or more. But in practice, my average holding period is about two years. Some of the stocks I recommend today will doubtless be out of my portfolio a year hence. In most columns, I include a disclaimer: Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Since today’s column is about the stocks I actually own, I will give my firm’s actual performance (on a composite of individual accounts). In the 25 ¼ years through March 31, we have achieved a cumulative return of 764%, compared to 511% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index. In the 12 months through March 31, however, we trailed the index, 5.35% to 8.25%. Disclosure: I own all 23 stocks recommended in today’s column, both personally and for clients.

Title: Amazon Ramps Up Enshittification With Even More Ads On Prime Video
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/23/amazon-ramps-up-enshittification-with-even-more-ads-on-prime-video/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T12:25:00Z
Full Content:
(Mis)Uses of Technology Back in early 2024 Amazon announced that Prime Video customers (who already pay $140 per year) would be charged $3 extra every month just to avoid ads that didn’t previously exist. It was just the latest example of “enshittification” in a streaming sector all out of original ideas, desperate to provide Wall Street with impossible skyward quarterly growth — regardless of consumer annoyance or brand harm. When originally announced, Amazon promised it would try to keep the ad load to three-and-a-half minutes per hour to try and be less annoying than its competitors. But the march toward enshittification yields to no one; 18 months later and Amazon has already doubled that volume of advertisements per hour: “According to six ad buyers and documents reviewed by ADWEEK, the current ad load on Prime Video now ranges from four to six minutes per hour. And while that could bring down CPMs, buyers will be watching whether this impacts user experience.” In the modern era it’s simply not allowed for a public company to offer people an affordable product everyone really likes. The unyielding pressures for quarterly growth at any cost inevitably result in the cannibalization and enshittification of most of your favorite products. It’s obvious everywhere; but particularly in newer industries (like say, video streaming) that were disruptive just a few years earlier. Amazon has told eager investors but hasn’t bothered to communicate the latest enshittifcation to consumers yet. When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) and if it was it would be okay because Amazon is focused on “improving ad experiences”: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” As new growth in streaming customers has slowed down, giant media companies have relegated to seeking old ways to give Wall Street their sweet, sweet, improved quarterly returns. That means not just price hikes, but layoffs, pointless mergers, less money spent on content and residuals (meaning they’re too cheap to keep popular programs online), and crackdowns on things that used to be consumer benefits, like the lax treatment of things like password sharing. The short term stock boosts and tax gains from this kind of gamesmanship and consolidation disincentivizes execs from learning anything useful from the experience. By the time consumers begin a backlash and the brand begins to tank, the executives who led the charge are already off working at a different company on the basis of their “savvy deal-making prowess.” It’s purely extractive and utterly pathological. Consumer interest, employee welfare, and the long term integrity or quality of the brand or product simply have nothing to do with it. In this case, streaming companies are going to keep pushing their luck until piracy sees a massive resurgence (which is already starting to happen), at which point the executives will blame everyone and everything but themselves. Instead of any sort of self-awareness of the doom cycle they participate in, they’ll do something even more harmful: like lobbying Congress to make VPNs illegal. Filed Under: ad load, advertisements, amazon prime, competition, consumers, enshittification, streaming, tv, video Companies: amazon Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown So they’re going to stop showing ads? Hold on, they didn’t say they were gonna do that—just that they’re “committed to” doing it, whatever that means; it’s certainly not a guarantee you can collect on. And, of course, they didn’t say it would be an improvement for the viewers. Maybe they’ll “improve ad experiences” for the advertisers, but I suspect the real improvements be for their own employee-bonuses and for Jeff Bezos’s pocketbook (which may imply accidental short-term benefits to minor shareholders, too). Thank God! I sure was getting bored of watching shows without ads! Giving up Amazon Prime turned out to be much easier and painless than I expected, and that was before they started enshittifying in earnest. Amazon in general turns out to be ridiculously easy to walk away from. I highly recommend doing so. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it.

When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) […]: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” This is not a lie, just your standard marketing double-speak. It doesn’t say what Karl says it does. It never actually says ad load isn’t increasing, or won’t be increasing. Rather, it avoids the question entirely, and answers an unasked question about their “commitment” instead. Even their “commitment” is compatible with increasing the number of ads shown, as long as they’re not “simply” doing that. “Improving ad experiences” (for whom?) could include increasing the number of ads. That’s not “simply increasing the number”; it’s increasing the number, combined with doing some other stuff. People have been complaining about the enshittification of Amazon’s shopping site for about a decade now, to no avail. Apparently, counterfeit products are a big concern. I don’t shop there, but I do come across Amazon links from search engines sometimes, and it’s astounding how often (for the last year or two) I’ve seen errors about something failing on Amazon’s end, and asking me to try again. When it does work, even if the search has a brand name, the screen’s often full of other brands instead, and I have to scroll to find whatever the search was for. And most reviews aren’t without logging in now. The thing to remember about Amazon Prime is that most of its customers probably never subscribed because of the streaming. They subscribed for the free shipping, and maybe at some point started watching the video service because it was bundled. If Amazon can get them to not watch the video service, but to stay subscribed, that’s the ideal outcome. Youtube already have dominated the news about war against adblocking, copied Hulu’s pause ads on TV and mobile app, and introduced double non-skip ads. Amazon charges you AND serves you ads. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads (other than sponsors content within the video, if the content creator does that). BIG difference there. You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You’re just one person, and evidence suggests this is not a widespread view. Newspapers and magazines generally did both, plus abused people’s personal data by selling it to postal spammers. (While dead media may not be a great example, that’s not the reason it died.) You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. That’s why I’ve never had a subscription for Sky. Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. They haven’t. I had cable TV (via older relatives) in the 1980s and 1990s, and don’t recall the provider advertising except on the TV guide channel (and maybe the bills, and radio and TV stations). The main ads anyone saw were from the broadcast channels that the cable provider was being paid to relay. What were they gonna do, black those out? Eventually, cable-only networks did appear, some of which had advertising. That sucked, but, again, it was done by the channel providers, not the cable providers. A lot of people, by the way, have been telling satellite and cable TV providers to take a hike. Techdirt’s written about “cord-cutting” many times—but, at this point, I think it’s kind of done, and subscriber counts are going down more due to death than cancellation per se. (If you haven’t watched live television in a while, you may not have noticed that the ads have become targeted to old people—hearing aids, motor-reclining chairs, etc.) If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads Maybe not on YouTube, but are they still collecting viewing data and using it for ad targeting elsewhere? Fuck Hulu. – 🇨🇦 “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences Translation: “Our commitment is to ramp up our spying and data mining even more, so as to present viewers with advertisements for items, for example, that they’ve talked about in the presence of an Amazon Echo” Every thing you want to watch on it costs extra. What are you even paying for? What are you even paying for? Generally, people are buying it for the free and faster shipping. Sure, Amazon touts other benefits such as video, but it’s best for them if people don’t use any of that. Preferably not even the shipping benefits (there are ways to get them for free without Prime, and if a subscriber falls into such patterns by accident, their Prime subscription is just free revenue for Amazon). Last I checked uBlock Origin worked on Prime Video ads, but it’s been a little while since I watched Prime Video. In biology, unchecked constant growth is known as cancer. And if capitalism is not brought under control, it will go on to drive humanity right to extinction. I wouldn’t mind the commercials if they were more relevant to my interests. Yes, I know people find relevant ads to be creepy and intrusive, but my point is that Amazon already collects so much data about my shopping habits that I shouldn’t see the same drug ads that I see on regular TV. I stopped watching CBS This Morning because it became drug ads interrupted by a news segment. If I were advertisers, I’d be more picky about the data that the streaming services provide. Do people interact with the ads, such as scanning the QR code, or ignoring it? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? I don’t know what’s cheaper, but I think the bottom line is that advertising companies are able to convince their clients that, whatever it is that the ad company is doing, it’s working. I mean, their business is basically to sell people stuff they don’t need; that doesn’t just apply to the ad viewers. Or if they weren’t the same damn 2 commercials over and over again? Streaming was only ever of value when it was more convenient than piracy. That is no longer the case. It is worse. I paid for ad free, but it has suddenly gone away. Bye Amazon i got’s me one of them raspberry pi’s. it’s nicely loaded with ad blockers! so the likes of prime and you tube can fuck right off! 100% add free! well almost….some video’s have sponsored ads presented by the channel host/ maker. but that can be skipped through. YouTube Premium has rapidly increased in cost over the few couple of years. All the content is freely produced by content creators – nothing is paid for directly upfront any more as far as I know. The content creators are constantly complaining about the lack of revenue. Alphabet keeps promising “improvements” for the increasing price. But as a user I struggle to think of a single improvement, let alone one that benefits me. There are heaps of features I’d love to see but there is no process for users to offer feedback, the only feedback is from content creators and advertisers. If the price increases don’t benefit me or the content creators , that leave one last beneficiary of the price hikes… Over the years I have successfully “voted with my wallet” away from so many services but YouTube really feels like a monopoly – I paid for Pandora for a year but its just too small and found myself just going back to YT. I think only an antitrust action can save the users from Alphabets unbridled greed. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Have a Techdirt Account? Sign in now.

Title: I had a comfortable life in Big Tech, but something unsettled me. I quit to start my own company — now I feel more fulfilled.

Time Published: 2025-06-23T10:03:13Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 41-year-old Srikanth Narayan, the CEO and founder of Cache, from the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity. My career began in San Francisco. I've been in Silicon Valley ever since, working at both startups and Big Tech companies. In 2021, after roughly eight years working at Uber and then Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, I decided it was the right time to take a leap and become an entrepreneur. I had built a healthy financial cushion and was ready to take a risk and create a new company. I noticed a problem around Big Tech compensation — concentration risk. I saw an opportunity to help build a solution and educate employees on this risk. Entrepreneurship has been a lot harder than working in Big Tech, but I've found it far more fulfilling. Prior to founding Cache, I spent most of my career focusing on data visualization. In 2014, Uber recruited me to lead a data visualization application suite. I stayed at Uber for six years and eventually became a staff engineer. If you work at a company like Uber for a long time, a lot of your compensation is in the form of stock, sometimes outsizing your cash compensation. As the company grows and does well, your net worth grows in line with the stock. This creates wealth for the people who hold that stock, but having way too much of your net worth in a few stocks means you're taking undue risk. Take Tesla. In recent months, some people who worked at Tesla may have seen their net worth fluctuate due to the changing value of the company's stock. People tend to hold on to these massive stock positions due to inertia and because the taxes for reallocating stock can be very expensive. I joined Uber at a good time. The company mostly did well and went public in 2019. All of the wealth I had accumulated in stock became real money on the open market that I could sell or trade. However, I had a lot of low-basis stocks that would trigger a high capital gains bill if I sold them. When I joined Waymo in 2020, my Alphabet colleagues talked about similar problems. I found this issue unsettling. A steep drop in stock price at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic affected my portfolio. I hired a wealth manager to help me find solutions for concentration risk. They showed me products that help people of high net worth manage concentration risk. One option is depositing concentrated stock into an exchange fund where others have done the same, and receiving fund units in return. This method can diversify your portfolio while deferring capital gains taxes. It sounded like a great product, but none of my peers had heard of it. It seemed to only be available at private banks, and only for people of a certain net worth. From what I saw, the exchange funds required a lot of human operational coordination. There seemed to be little innovation in this area to improve efficiency. I saw a massive business opportunity. I wanted to make products like this more efficient and available more broadly. I resigned from Waymo in late 2021 to start my business, Cache, which I formally launched in March 2024. We're a specialized brokerage for people holding large stock positions. Our flagship product is an exchange fund that helps people diversify their portfolios. My experience at Uber gave me an understanding of how to turn an idea into a full-blown vision as a founder. I designed products at Uber that became widely adopted within the company. This took engineering work and entrepreneurial spirit. However, moving from corporate life to building a company myself involved a lot of learning on the job. There wasn't really a manual I could follow for building an exchange fund, so we had to do a lot of R&D. There were many steps involved, including working with the SEC and FINRA to get the right registrations, since the industry is highly regulated, and building the technical infrastructure for a brokerage system. I was one of the first users of my own product, and I invested a lot of my Uber stock in our exchange funds. Running a startup is very different from working at a Big Tech company. I'm probably working triple the time I was before. Being employed in Big Tech was a very comfortable life. You worked on challenging problems and got paid well to do it. While I enjoyed this, I also wanted to figure out my own path. The entrepreneurial journey has been more fulfilling. I've had to go through personal trials, such as not paying myself for the first year after leaving Waymo. Because of my financial cushion from working in Silicon Valley, the stress of this didn't really bear on me. I'd made sure I had several years of living expenses in reserve before taking the leap. Becoming an entrepreneur requires drive and conviction. It's a very hard journey, and often, market forces will be against you until they start working with you. The glamour of being a startup founder or of an exit is the wrong reason for forming a company. It should be about self-fulfillment and a passion for building something from scratch and making a change in the world. Do you have a story to share about leaving Big Tech?

Title: Your Echo Devices Can Do So Much More With These 200 Voice Commands

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement These go-to Alexa commands save time, simplify tasks, and make daily life easier. If you have the latest Echo Dot with Clock, you can start using these voice commands today. Alexa has come a long way since its early days as a basic voice assistant. What once felt like a novelty for playing music or checking the weather is now a powerful tool for managing your entire home. With the launch of Alexa Plus and its new AI-powered features, Amazon's voice assistant is smarter and more capable than ever before. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a must-have tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now is the perfect time to see how much more useful it has become. with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Title: Move over, Magnificent 7: Goldman Sachs proposes the ‘Prom 10,’ China’s top stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and BYD
URL: https://fortune.com/asia/2025/06/23/goldman-sachs-china-prominent-10-magnificent-7/

Cecilia Hult is an editorial intern based in Hong Kong. Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S. It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%. Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI. But what about China? Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services. Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years. The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy. The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC. E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies. Meituan, China’s food delivery giant, is another Prom 10 stock. The company holds a 70% market share in the delivery space, and is expanding to new markets like Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Yet the stock has taken a beating in recent weeks due to fierce competition from JD.com, another e-commerce giant. BYD, the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, and Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone brand that’s recently expanded to cars, also hold spots in Goldman Sachs’ “Prom 10.” Chinese EVs are quickly winning over customers both in China and overseas, due to the affordable price points and appealing designs. That’s helped boost the shares of both companies: BYD and Xiaomi are up by around 45% and 60% respectively. Midea Group is one of China’s leading manufacturers of home appliances and another Prom 10 stock. The company debuted on Hong Kong’s stock exchange last year, raising almost $4 billion. Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, and Midea are all on Fortune’s Global 500, which ranks the world’s largest companies by revenue. Rounding out the Prom 10 are NetEase Games, the second-highest grossing gaming company in China; Hengrui, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer; Trip.com, a travel booking platform; and ANTA, the world’s third-largest sportswear company, behind Nike and Adidas. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman, The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist (1998) Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer calling for a repeal of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which provided hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to unreliable wind and solar. TWTW continues with the significant omissions in proclamations by NOAA and other organizations in claiming increasing carbon dioxide is acidifying the oceans. TWTW discusses assertions by organizations and individuals that climate misinformation should be criminalized, ignoring the fact that such organizations and individuals rely on information that fails to meet the standards of the scientific method. TWTW questions what is meant by an existential threat, then concludes with a presentation of part of the program of the upcoming DDP conference and where to register to attend in person or by Zoom. ********************* Repeal IRA Subsidies: Last week, TWTW focused on a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer emphasizing Gold Standard Science. “Scientific Knowledge Is Determined by the Scientific Method, Not by Government Opinion, Consensus, 97% of Scientists’ Opinions, Peer Review, Models that Do Not Work, or Cherry-Picked, Fabricated, Falsified or Omitted Contradictory Data.” This week, the CO2 Coalition published a paper by the same two authors titled “IRA Climate Subsidies Should Be Repealed.” The authors state: “Physics demonstrates that the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) trillion-dollar climate subsidies rest on false science. The real science, which is virtually never reported, is that the IRA subsidies of $4.7 trillion (Cato’s estimate to 2050) aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have no climate benefit, for two separate and cumulative reasons: First, the physics of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases shows that reducing them to net zero will have a negligible effect on temperatures and extreme weather. At present, there are no effective replacements for fossil fuels, and eliminating them will be disastrous for people worldwide. The scientific fact is that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the world’s food supply by about 40%, with a trivial effect on Earth’s climate. Second, the theory that GHG emissions are the primary driver of climate change is based on false science, such as consensus, theoretical models that do not work, fabricated and falsified data, agenda-driven peer review and government opinions. None of this is real science. (See our June 7, 2025, paper for details, Physics Demonstrates That Increasing Greenhouse Gases Cannot Cause Dangerous Warming, Extreme Weather or Any Harm.) In summary, IRA subsidies will waste trillions of dollars for no climate benefit, reducing carbon dioxide emissions will reduce the amount of food worldwide, eliminating fossil fuels will be disastrous for people worldwide, and the trillions of dollars would be better spent improving Americans’ standard of living. Accordingly, all the IRA climate subsidies should be repealed ASAP.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Another Significant Omission: The false Endangerment Finding by the EPA under Lisa Jackson in 2009 under the Obama Administration asserts: “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and to endanger the public welfare of current and future generations.” The finding ignores or omits contradictory evidence including the only comprehensive global temperature data existing, the estimates of temperature from satellite evidence calculated since 1979 by Roy Spencer and John Christy and published monthly by the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Similar calculations by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) independently verify their results. In 1998. Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS discovered that UAH failed to correctly compensate for orbital drift. When the error was discovered and verified, Spencer and Christy quickly made appropriate adjustments, in keeping with the scientific method. Errors need to be exposed, verified, and corrected. Ignoring them or omitting them is contrary to the scientific method. For years, NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research has funded the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), a climate modeling laboratory at Princeton. NOAA also funds the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), which is a collaboration between GFDL and Princeton University. For over forty years, GFDL and CIMES have ignored UAH data and have omitted validating their models against atmospheric data, which is where the greenhouse gas effect occurs. NOAA funds organizations that systematically ignore the scientific method and fail to test their predictions against physical evidence. The findings of these organizations cannot be considered scientific. Another NOAA activity that is considered scientific but fails the scientific method is ocean acidification which was boosted when environmental ecologist Jane Lubchenco was administrator of NOAA during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. The claim that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will acidify the oceans contains a bit of scientific fact surrounded by a bodyguard of lies and omissions. As a gas, water vapor contains no CO2 and has a pH of 7 which is neutral. But when it liquefies in the atmosphere and falls as rain, it absorbs CO2 making a weak acid, carbonic acid. All rain is carbonic acid and has a pH ranging from 4 to 6. Thus, it is common that in land areas with moderate to heavy rainfall, such as the tropics, the soils are acidic. Millions of years of rainfall have washed CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans. Roughly, there is about 50 to 60 times more carbon dioxide in oceans than in the atmosphere. So, direct rainfall will slightly increase CO2 in the oceans, slightly lowering the pH. Yet after millions of years of rainfall, the oceans are alkaline with pH of about 8.1. A fact that NOAA and others ignore. To recall, the acidity or alkalinity of a solution is measured by the pH scale with 7 as neutral. The scale is a base 10 logarithm. Alkaline drain cleaner has a pH of about 14; bleach has a pH of about 13. Is bleach 10 times more acidic than alkaline drain cleaner? Hen eggs have a pH of about 8 (oceans 8.1); sweet cream butter has a pH of about 6.0 to 6.7. Does cooking eggs in butter make them acidic? Further, the areas in the oceans, called Marine primary production areas or regions, are areas where ocean upwellings bring carbon dioxide and other nutrients to the surface and marine life flourishes. Examples are the Grand Banks in the Atlantic off Canada, the area off Monterey, California, off Canada and Alaska, and off most of Europe. As with most such distortions, the claim of ocean acidification requires a huge ignorance of geological history. Mollusks evolved in the Cambrian explosion of life, about 540 million years ago, when CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were about ten times what they are today. Marine creatures with shells containing calcium carbonate evolved before then, with even higher concentrations of CO2. Great limestone beds were laid down during the hot, high CO2 Cambrian period. Reef building corals evolved around 245 million years ago. Since then, Earth has experienced periods far hotter than today and periods with CO2 concentrations far greater than today. Reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues. The coral provides the algae with a protected environment and the carbon dioxide and nitrogen (for chlorophyll and other compounds) needed for photosynthesis, while the algae, through photosynthesis, provides the coral with energy, nutrients, and their vibrant colors. Changes in water temperatures, salinity, or solar irradiance can cause corals to expel the algae, turning them white. They are not dead but may need a different variety of zooxanthellae, which are diverse with many clades (groups of organisms believed to have a common ancestor) and types. There is no reason to assume that a modest lowering of pH will kill corals any more than slow changes in temperatures will kill them. However, human causes including sediment from land disturbances and destructive fishing practices such as using dynamite and cyanide do kill them. Water running into the oceans for millions of years often passes over many types of alkaline material resulting in a pH of about 8.1, alkaline. The best scientific explanation why increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will not acidify the oceans TWTW has seen was written by the late Roger Cohen and William Happer ten years ago. The paper is mathematical, but the summary is clear. The authors begin the section titled Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean with: Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2 and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4− 2, which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water. Further, the authors explain how weak acids (notably carbonic acid (H2CO3)) make rainwater slightly acidic, with a pH = 5.4 (vinegar has pH ~ 3). The authors estimate that if the oceans were not buffered by weak acids, the oceans would have a pH of about 11.4. The Summary states [figures not shown here, boldface added]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed. For example: • The oceans would be highly alkaline with a pH of about 11.4, similar to that of household ammonia, if there were no weak acids to buffer the alkalinity. Almost all of the buffering is provided by dissolved CO2, with very minor additional buffering from boric acid, silicic acid, and other even less important species. • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the pH of ocean water from about 8.2 to 7.9. This is well within the day-night fluctuations that already occur because of photosynthesis by plankton and less than the pH decreases with depth that occur because of the biological pump and the dissolution of calcium carbonate precipitates below the lysocline. [The depth where the rate of dissolution of calcium carbonate starts to increase significantly due to these changes in pressure and temperature.] • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the carbonate-ion concentration, [CO2− 3], by about 30%. Ocean surface waters are already supersaturated by several hundred per cent for formation of CaCO3 crystals from Ca2+ and CO2− 3. So, scare stories about dissolving carbonate shells are nonsense. • The ocean has only absorbed 1/3 or less of the CO2 that it would eventually absorb when the concentrations of CO2 in the deep oceans came to equilibrium with surface concentrations. Effects like that of the biological pump and calcium carbonate dissolution below the lysocline allow the ocean to absorb substantially more than the amount that would be in chemical-equilibrium with the atmosphere. • Over most of the Phanerozoic, the past 550 million years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been measured in thousands of parts per million, and life flourished in both the oceans and on land. This is hardly surprising, given the relative insensitivity of ocean pH to large changes in CO2 concentrations that we have discussed above and given the fact that the pH changes that do occur are small compared to the natural variations of ocean pH in space and time.” This is another instance where US government “science” is so politicized that it becomes nonsense.

This Summary for Policymakers summarizes findings from the larger Synthesis Report “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review” (SR2025.1). The central conclusion of the Synthesis Report is that powerful actors—including corporations, governments, and political parties—intentionally spread inaccurate or misleading narratives about anthropogenic climate change. These narratives circulate across digital, broadcast, and interpersonal communication channels. The result is a decline in public trust, diminished policy coordination, and a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction. There is a severe gap in research on climate information integrity in the Global South, where impacts are likely to be significant but poorly documented. Key takeaways from the synthesis include: 1. coordinated misinformation campaigns actively shape climate narratives; 2. scientific consensus is frequently misrepresented in media; 3. regulatory enforcement and access to data remain uneven globally; 4. information integrity research is heavily concentrated in the Global North. The report concludes with an assessment of policy recommendations that have been made over time, identifying for policymakers the four areas where impact has been consistently positive: • legislation to ensure standardized carbon reporting and labelling, • litigation to ensure enforcement of the standards, • coalition building across stakeholder groups, • education of policymakers and the public. This study delivers the first global, systematic assessment of information integrity about climate science. It draws on research by hundreds of scholars and thousands of peer-reviewed studies published over the past decade, with a methodologically rigorous review of 300 papers on policy solutions. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers must enact to shield humankind—and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat. In short, this group proclaims that it understands scientific knowledge from “scientific consensus” and any group presenting physical evidence contradicting them should be punished. This organization produced another report titled: “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review.” It claims that [citations omitted here but in report, boldface added]: “The United Nations (UN) has played an important role in placing the issue of information integrity on public and policy agendas, including for the area of climate change. In 2024, the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity were presented; that year also witnessed the launch of the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, spearheaded by Brazil and coordinated through UNESCO. The Global Principles highlighted the need for ‘independent, free and pluralistic media’ around the world as vehicles of information and opinion formation. They also called for more “transparency and research” into whether and how traditional media and online communication platforms maintain information integrity in the public interest. That publication, however, stopped short of offering an explicit or operational definition of information integrity. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers (see SFP2025.2) must enact to shield humankind— and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat.” Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall uncovered a UN Human Rights Council report that calls for punishment of those who oppose abandoning fossil fuels. The summary of the report states: “The present report clarifies States’ international human rights obligations and businesses’ responsibilities to phase out fossil fuels and related subsidies within the current decade. The interlinked, intergenerational, severe and widespread human rights impacts of the fossil fuel life cycle, coupled with six decades of climate obstruction, compel urgent defossilization of our whole economies, for a just transition that is effective, human rights based and transformative in protecting the climate, nature, water and food on which life and health for present and future generations depend.” [Boldface added] For example, Richard Lindzen and William Happer used the scientific method to expose the folly of Net Zero. Are they to be punished for producing physical evidence contradicting the claims of the UN organizations which, for years, have led the effort to abandon fossil fuels which are needed for reliable electricity, heat, and transportation? Do UN bureaucrats and their defenders believe they have the right to determine the truth of scientific principles? The quote of the week is: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman. If misinformation on the causes and extent of climate change becomes a criminal offence, would the UN be a criminal organization? Has the UN become an advocate for causing destitute poverty and starvation (by prohibiting use of artificial fertilizer which produce greenhouse gases)?

The decision of the judges is final. ********************* Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved. DEMAND: On June 20, the business day with the longest period of sunlight, the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) reported that the demand trend for electricity fell to its lowest point at about 12:30 pm (local time) with a demand of 19,500 MW. About 6:30 pm demand began peaking at 28,000 MW and remained there or above until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW. Except between about 10 am and 3 pm, demand did not go below 22,000 MW. SUPPLY: On the same day, renewables (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biomass, Biogas, and Small Hydro) reached a near peak of about 25,000 MW at 8:30 am and remained there or more until 5:30 pm when they fell dramatically to about 7,500 MW at 8 pm where they remained the rest of the evening. When it is functioning solar is the biggest generator at over 18,000 MW with wind second at about 5,000 MW. Large hydro provided an average of about 3,750 MW for the rest of the evening and Nuclear about 2,280 MW. The rest of the electricity came from imports (mostly coal and other fossil fuels), and batteries. The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. On the longest business day of the year for sunshine, after 8:00 pm CAISO needed 28,000 MW of power until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW while renewables were delivering 7,500 MW and batteries were delivering between 7,000 and 8,000 MW until 10 pm when they declined. Based on rough calculations, just for that evening (8 pm to midnight) CAISO needed 110,000 MWh of power while renewables delivered 30,000 MWh and the power delivered by large hydro alone was about 14,280 MWh. Thus, taking away nuclear, the shortfall would be about 35,000 MWh. Existing batteries delivered about 27,000 MWh and California just approved the “World’s Largest’ Energy Storage Site” with 4,600 kWh (4.6 MWh) of battery storage with no costs given. If California goes net zero with no nuclear, what will California do on a cold, windless night in January? How will it replenish its batteries? If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California? According to the US EIA, except for isolated Hawaii, residential electricity prices in California are already the highest in the country. In March, the US national average was 17.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, while in California it was 32.41 cents per kilowatt-hour and Hawaii 41.11.

Santer, Susan Solomon, et al., PNAS, June 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. [SEPP Comment: A thought fantasy, not a thought experiment. The state-of-the-art climate models produce results that are wrong. Why bother with a thought experiment until the state-of-the-art models produce accurate predictions that are supported by physical evidence? Further, in the mid-19th century, Europe was emerging from the Little Ice Age which killed hundreds of thousands from starvation and related diseases. Why would warming be considered harmful to humanity? Finally, the authors cite the early work of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius but not his 1908 paper which admitted his early work was wrong.

This sponsored “journalism” by the infamous Seattle Times ClimateLab, is based on a report by a well-known climate change advocacy group, Climate Central. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? A weak wind By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, what has the Washington Post to say on the quietest hurricane season globally since 1970? Why, it was completely quiet about it. (As it was on “climate” save for a mention of a prediction from the Climate Prediction Center.) Unless you count “This spurt of activity shows no signs of ending for now.” Yes. “This spurt of activity” is actually how they describe the quietest start to a season in more than half a century. Satire can’t keep up. And no matter how cynical you get, it’s not enough. Major Errors in Seattle Times ClimateLab Article on Sea-level Rise By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, June 20, 2025 My frustration with the often false, misleading, and exaggerated information pushed by the Seattle Times ClimateLab is frequently expressed in this blog, but the tall tales provided this week is worth a rating of at least four Pinocchios. The story suggests that the Samish Tribe of NW Washington has to “race” to document their heritage sites because rising sea level and “intensifying storm surges” remove any chance to understand their significance.” In reality, none of this is true. Communicating Better to the Public – Exaggerate, or be Vague? Researchers discover microplastics at all ocean depths New NSF-supported study helps inform efforts to safeguard fisheries and protect human health Press Release, NSF, June 16, 2025 Link to paper: The distribution of subsurface microplastics in the ocean By Shiye Zhao, et al., Nature, April 30, 2025 From the abstract: Although microplastics can be found throughout the oceanic water column3,4, most studies collect microplastics from surface waters (less than about 50-cm depth) using net tows. Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column.

May be hot, maybe not By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 Point zero six above 2020? Can they say with a straight face that they’ve measured global temperature comprehensively to that degree of precision? Of course not. We’re not even buying the 0.1, let alone the 2 that followed it. As for that estimated 1850-1900 average, as we’ve said before, if you think we know the temperature for every square foot of what was then the Belgian Congo in 1873, or the mid-Pacific, or for that matter Rome, you are a chump or worse. IRA Incentives Fuel U.S. Solar Manufacturing Surge By Aaron Larson, Power Mag, June 11, 2025 The centerpiece of this revival is the IRA’s comprehensive package of tax incentives designed to rebuild America’s solar supply chain. The domestic content bonus tax credit offers project developers an additional 10% on top of the base 30% investment tax credit (ITC) when they use U.S.-made components. This creates demand-side pull for domestically manufactured solar products. According to U.S. Treasury Department data, more than $196 billion in clean power investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage, demonstrating the market’s strong response to these incentives. [Boldface added] [SEPP Comment: More deceit, America never had a solar supply chain to rebuild.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Amber Alerts For Sunny Weather By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 19, 2025 “Amber heat health alerts are in place across the whole of England with temperatures likely to exceed 30C [86F] for the first time this year.” Meanwhile back in the real world, summer remains the season when deaths tolls are at their lowest: ‘Climate Grieving’ at UK Centre for Climate Psychology By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, June 17, 2025 The organization has a flagship book, Climate, Psychology and Change: Reimagining Psychotherapy in an Era of Global Disruption and Climate Anxiety.

Our food systems will break down. Billions will be forced out of their homes and countries. This means war, starvation, slaughter, and rape on a global scale. And the collapse is coming here, too. The science is clear: the use of fossil fuels must end, immediately, if we hope to survive. Instead of leading the transition, our government gambles our future on unproven technologies and hopeful thinking… while quietly continuing to fund and faciliate the fossil fuel death project. Questioning European Green Kathryn Porter Reviews The Spanish Blackouts Report By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 Link to: Should NESO [UK Electrical system operator] be allowed to lower its minimum inertia requirement? By Kathryn Porter, Watt-Logic, June 18, 2025 From Porter: Whether this ambition will be possible even with the dodgy carbon accounting rules is unclear. In the summer months, gas power stations are often turned up by the system operator in order to stabilize the grid, providing important inertia to control voltage across the network. Throughout the summer, NESO has observed unexplained voltage oscillations (which I will discuss in another post – this is being held up by junk frequency data being reported to Elexon which has yet to be corrected, despite Elexon requesting re-submission), including on the day before the Iberian blackout. These oscillations can, in extreme circumstances, cause the type of grid failure that led to the loss of eleven lives on 28 April in Spain and Portugal.

Questioning Green Elsewhere G-7: Africans Deserve Real Electricity By Brenda Shaffer, Real Clear Energy, June 17, 2025 Data on electricity access in U. S. government, IEA, World Bank, and UN reports should be categorized as reliable or not. Africans receiving a few hours a day of unreliable power should not be counted as achieving full electricity access. ‘Net Zero’ Is Collapsing in U.S. States By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, June 16, 2025 Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, how’s that green transition working for you? Oh. Not so good? For instance, from way down south we hear that “The initial cost of producing green hydrogen from Australia’s two largest projects will be more than four times the price of rival energy sources, posing a fresh setback for Labor’s bid to deliver a major new export ­industry by 2030 and meet net-zero goals.” And you told us you had it all figured out. Blockbuster: Mark Carney, Mr Net-Zero-Banker himself, now uses oil, gas to make Canada an Energy SuperPower By Jo Nova, Her Blog, June 17, 2025 The US is the world’s top producer of oil at the moment, with 44 billion barrels of oil in reserve. Amazingly Canada has four times as much — or 171 billion barrels of oil in recoverable reserves, says the Telegraph. It’s amazing how stupid rich countries can be — to leave, as Alberta’s premier says, “$9 trillion worth of oil wealth we have in the ground”? Speaking of stupid, perhaps the greatest and saddest irony is that Mark Carney once was the green-extreme Governor of the Bank of England. And while there, he helped tie the UK down in carbon markets and energy transitions that still cripple their economy.

Energy Issues – Non-US Spanish Blackouts Due To “Miscalculation”! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 18, 2025 “The massive power cut that plunged huge swathes of Spain and Portugal into chaos earlier this year was caused by a miscalculation, the Spanish government has said.” No, Sky, it was not a miscalculation. It was the inevitable result of running the grid mainly on highly variable, low inertia renewables. That in turn was the consequence of deliberate government policy.

The Lethal Fog of Clean-Air Hypocrisy By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, June 18, 2025 Why do environmental extremists expect Nairobi, Dhaka or Lagos to skip the rational evolution of energy use that so benefited the lives and economies of the U.K. – and of many other western nations? Why do they think an African mother should wait decades – or forever – to cook without smoke? The answer lies in an elitist worldview that treats energy as a lifestyle choice rather than a lifeline. America as a Reliable Energy Partner By Fred H. Hutchison, Real Clear Energy, June 19, 2025 The statement that drew the fierce rebuttal was that “for fifty years Europe saw Russia as a reliable natural gas supplier… and now there is growing concern that Europe may be headed towards over reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States.” NESO Winter Outlook By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 “The National Energy System Operator (Neso), which oversees Britain’s electricity grid, said it would import power from France and other nearby European neighbors this winter to help backstop the network.” Homewood: NESO don’t publish the actual numbers – this will wait till their full Outlook later in the year. But they are projecting around 15 GW of renewables, which looks grossly optimistic. There will be no solar power generated when demand peaks in early evening, and we have regularly seen wind power drop to less than 2 GW. (Biomass, it appears, is included under thermal).

The flashpoint is centered on when large customers seek to bypass conventional transmission planning and cost allocation by co-locating directly with generation sources. That practice, often framed as “behind-the-meter” or “non-network” load development, has raised concerns from grid operators, utilities, and regulators who argue that even ostensibly self-supplied data centers still rely on the broader grid for backup, balancing, and reliability services.

The ultimate goal of energy tax credits is not to reduce tax burdens, but to help companies bring a larger amount of lower-cost and cleaner energy to the market — benefiting the American people. Cash is often preferable to tax credits in accomplishing that goal. The third policy is all the more relevant given this demand surge: restoring support for solar leasing companies. Solar leasing directly benefits U.S. homeowners by allowing them to install panels on their property with a monthly payment plan instead of swallowing the upfront cost. Not only does rooftop solar drive down consumer electricity costs, but it also gives Americans more independence by helping them to get off the grid and cut their reliance on utility companies.

By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, June 16, 2025 The greatest oxymoron statement of all time: ‘Renewable Energy’ By Ronald Stein and Roger Caiazza, America Out Loud News, June 16, 2025 Wind and solar projects that generate electricity under favorable weather conditions only exist because of government subsidies that finance these projects. To date, none of the wind and solar projects around the world have ever been financed with private capital, as there is no return on such investments. Claims that renewables are cheaper overlook the costs of backing up those sources when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. When included, costs are much higher.

At the bottom of the vogue for this exotic term may be the basic human fear of death. By Andrew Hartz. WSJ, June 16, 2025 TWTW Summary: The clinical psychologist and the founder of the Open Therapy Institute begins with: “So-called existential risks seem to be everywhere. Climate change, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, pandemics and more threaten to return us to nothingness. Most people using this term aren’t consciously evoking the philosophy of Sartre or Camus. Still, they may be drawing on associations with existentialism more than they realize and unconsciously expressing deeper concerns about morality and meaning. In psychoanalysis, it isn’t unusual for a word to have an unconscious double meaning. For example, a patient in therapy might say that she can’t ‘bear’ children. She could consciously mean that she’s unable to get pregnant, while also unconsciously communicating that she can’t stand children. Or a grieving patient who’s struggling to find the right word might say, ‘I’m at a loss.’ Similarly, the word ‘existential’ points to catastrophic global threats, but it also echoes the concerns of existentialist philosophy, which addresses a range of topics from freedom to alienation. But the term is most strongly linked in the public imagination to issues of death and meaning. Saying an issue is ‘existential’ can express that it’s deeply tied to one’s fear of dying and need for purpose. We don’t have to overthink every word we say or hear, but there are signals that a word may have an unconscious double meaning. Therapists tend to think this phenomenon is most likely to occur when a word is used in an odd way—when it’s emotionally charged, when it’s repeated excessively or when it has clear resonance with one’s psychological concerns. The recent political use of the word ‘existential’ seems to check every box. People in the U.S. are shouting about how politics is ‘existential’ at the same time that American society is suffering from a marked crisis of purpose. The term is strange and was used rarely in the past, but its use has been increasing as people have become less able to tolerate the risks and uncertainties of life. Recent events—the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, the increasing secularization of society—could have triggered Americans’ existential concerns. Perhaps other factors are at play as well. For many, social-media platforms intensify feelings of insignificance. A loneliness epidemic might heighten anxieties about meaning. Distrust of authority can lead to feelings of confusion and insecurity. Whatever the causes, the sense that everything is an existential crisis is likely exacerbated by the increasing emotional fragility of younger generations. A prominent psychological theory, Terror Management Theory, posits that all people have anxiety about their mortality and that they cope with it in predictable ways. A robust body of evidence indicates that when people are reminded of their death, they try to boost their self-esteem, take steps to create a legacy and defend their worldview—be it secular or religious. An extension of this theory is that people cope with anxiety about death by focusing their fears onto something more tangible, such as a current political cause. That cause can then become emotionally loaded with all of their anxiety and distress about mortality. This temporarily makes their anxiety feel more manageable, but it’s likely to contribute to fanaticism and emotional dysregulation around politics. Political causes aimed at tackling ‘existential’ risks are often associated with safety culture. People seem to have an unconscious hope that regulations could protect them from ever dying. Sometimes, these rules and rituals even take on an obsessive-compulsive quality, as if the repetitions will magically stave off unknown risks. Many Covid practices had this flavor.” The author states the most clinicians think that fears of annihilation are fundamental influences on behavior which results in outlooks such as the world is going to be destroyed. He then concludes with: “Often, people come to yearn for an omnipotent state as the means to protect them from all their fears. They imagine total state control to protect them from all the internal feelings they can’t tolerate. Anxieties like this can easily become fodder for authoritarianism. Politics won’t solve our deeper problems. Meaning and purpose have to be found on one’s own, and people must develop ways to manage the uncertainties and risks of life. This can be challenging, but it’s the only path toward fulfillment, wisdom and freedom—to say nothing of mental health.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

As Billy Bob would say – “you gotta be shittin’ me!” Apparently, giving children a free school dinner (30 odd weeks a year) will save them from a life of poverty. I grew up in the 60s in a large, one-parent family. The stigma of handing over my free dinner ticket to the dinner ladies never left me; in fact, it drove me to make sure I never had to ask for a handout ever again. I’m not rich, but I’ve done ok for myself. Although I’m not sure today’s kids have enough gumption to get off their fat arses and make something of themselves. As the ocean warms, a new study found it’s also changing color https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article308985125.html Supreme Court Rules Fuel Producers Can Contest California’s Emissions Regulations The 7-2 ruling emphasized that it was not considering the substance of the dispute itself, but solely whether the producers had the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. The justices in a 7-2 ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to throw out the lawsuit by a Valero Energy (VLO.N) subsidiary and fuel industry groups. The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to let California set its own regulations. “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority. What is this? “ If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California?” I was not aware that CA exported nuclear power to the BPA. “An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” What a name! Why not just call themselves “The Ministry of Truth”? The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. And what is so ridiculous is that even could they manage to do it, it would have no material effect on the level of global emissions. Because California is not a big enough emitter for it to make much difference to the global total. It is utterly crazy how people insist on doing these expensive and completely ineffective things ‘because climate’, when even if the theory is correct, they will make no difference to the climate.

Δ Overall, the index slipped a scant 0.02%, as six pillars lost ground and five pillars advanced. In doing so, the CE 100 pantheon outperformed all of its broader benchmarks, as, for example, the S&P lost 0.5%. Banking names surged the most, adding 3%. LendingClub advanced by 5.3%. The company announced the rollout of its LevelUp Checking. The new offering is designed to help consumers move away from reliance on credit cards, especially given record-high credit card debt, by incentivizing the use of debit with rewards tied to debit spending. Target customers are individuals with high FICO scores (around 725) and high incomes ($125,000 to $130,000) who, despite their earnings, often lack immediate cash and carry substantial credit card debt, CEO Scott Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told Webster in an interview. The new LevelUp Checking product gives members 1% cash back for everyday spending with a LevelUp debit card on grocery and gas, among other key categories. Members who have LendingClub personal loans can also receive 2% cash back for making on-time loan payments from the LevelUp accounts. JPMorgan Chase plans to launch a product called a “deposit token” that will serve as a digital representation of commercial bank money and will be available only to the bank’s institutional clients. The deposit token, dubbed “JPMD,” will provide an alternative to stablecoins and will be closely connected to traditional banking systems. JPMorgan Chase will launch JPMD on Coinbase’s public blockchain, Base. JPMorgan’s stock gained 3.8%. In the Pay and Be Paid segment, up 0.3%, Visa has partnered with licensed stablecoin payments orchestrator Yellow Card to explore stablecoin use cases and opportunities across the African markets in which Yellow Card is licensed to operate. Together, the companies will seek opportunities to help streamline treasury operations and enhance liquidity management as well as test integration opportunities with Visa Direct to investigate cross-border payment options, Visa said. Visa’s stock lost 4%. But buy now, pay later names were higher, marked by Sezzle’s 10% rally and Affirm’s 5% boost. As PYMNTS reported, Affirm has announced a new revolving pass-through loan sale facility in which PGIM Fixed Income, a Prudential Financial company, will invest up to $3 billion over 36 months by purchasing up to $500 million of Affirm loans at any one time. This facility, which marks an expansion of the companies’ existing capital partnership, will support Affirm’s offering of pay-over-time options to consumers, the companies said. The Be Well sector led declining stocks, losing 2.5%. Peloton dipped by 11%, trading lower since news earlier this month that Peloton introduced its own peer-to-peer resale marketplace, Repowered. Users can list their pre-owned equipment and accessories from the connected fitness company on the Repowered platform. Sellers determine the listing price, aided by a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. In the Enablers group, which lost 0.3%, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has reportedly accused Meta of offering nine-figure signing bonuses to poach his workers. Shares gave up 0.7%. Amazon’s stock lost 1.1%. In a message penned by CEO Andy Jassy, and as reported by PYMNTS, employees who have learned how to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. Jassy added that Amazon’s total corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company adopts AI. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message.

Cookies help us display personalized product recommendations and ensure you have great shopping experience. Accept X Since we took over Smart Data Collective, we’ve made it a priority to focus on how artificial intelligence influences the practical side of data mining. You often hear about machine learning in broad strokes, but we aim to look at how these tools handle the messy reality of raw data. You can’t overstate the damage poor data quality causes. It is estimated by IBM that this issue costs U.S. businesses over $3.1 trillion every year. Keep reading to learn more. There are many ways AI helps clean up large datasets, especially in eliminating duplicates, correcting formats, and filling in gaps. You might have hundreds of spreadsheets from various sources, but AI can bring consistency to it all. You save hundreds of hours compared to doing it manually. It is easy to forget how quickly companies have scaled up their spending on AI tools. CNBC reports that Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft alone plan to spend up to $320 billion on AI and datacenter infrastructure in 2025. You can see how high the stakes have become when tech giants place that much of their budget behind it. There are not many industries left untouched by this trend. You might assume only tech companies are involved, but even traditional sectors are leaning on AI for their data work. There are organizations earning over $500 million a year, and according to Computer Weekly, they’re putting 5% of their revenue into AI projects. You often need advanced tools just to keep up with the amount of data modern businesses generate. It is not just about cleaning and sorting—AI also helps find patterns in customer behavior, supply chains, and market trends. You can build models that predict when people are most likely to make a purchase or when a part in a machine is likely to fail. There are no shortcuts, but AI brings new power to long-standing business challenges. I still remember the first time I tried to scrape data from a website for a project. I was hunched over my laptop, wrestling with Python scripts, cursing at broken CSS selectors, and wondering if the website’s layout would change before I could even finish my code. Fast forward to today, and the world of data extraction has been completely flipped on its head. The rise of AI web scrapers has not only made my life easier, but it’s also reshaping how entire data teams work—making data more accessible, workflows more efficient, and headaches a lot less frequent. Let’s be honest: the sheer volume of data online is exploding. In 2024, the world created about 149 zettabytes of data, and that number is expected to hit 181 zettabytes by 2025. With 97% of businesses investing in big data and 81% saying data is at the heart of decision-making, the pressure on data teams to deliver timely, high-quality web data has never been higher. But traditional scraping tools just can’t keep up. Enter the age of AI web scrapers—where automation, context-awareness, and accessibility are changing the rules for everyone. So, what exactly is an AI web scraper? Unlike the old-school scrapers that rely on brittle CSS selectors or XPath rules, AI web scrapers use natural language processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition to “read” web pages more like a human would. Instead of telling the tool, “Go grab the third <td> in this table,” you can just say, “Extract product names, prices, and ratings from this page,” and let the AI figure out the rest. What’s really exciting is the rise of AI agents—these are smart automation bots that can interpret your instructions, adapt to different websites, and even handle dynamic content or subpages. Tools like Thunderbit are leading the way here, making it possible for non-technical users (like sales teams, marketers, or real estate analysts) to scrape clean, structured data in just a couple of clicks. No more late-night debugging sessions or praying that your script survives the next website redesign. Having spent years in the trenches with Python scripts and selector-based tools, I can tell you: traditional web scraping is a slog. Tools like Oxylabs, Bright Data API, Octoparse, and ParseHub all require you to set up extraction rules for each website. That means: And let’s not forget the skill gap. Most traditional scrapers require at least some coding chops, which means business users are stuck waiting for the data team to build or fix things. It’s a bottleneck that slows everyone down. Let’s break it down: building a robust scraper for a single site can take hours or even days. Maintenance is an ongoing battle—one small change in the HTML and your whole pipeline can grind to a halt. Add in the need for proxies, anti-bot measures, and infrastructure for scaling, and suddenly your “quick script” is a full-blown engineering project. And the kicker? All that effort is just to keep the data flowing. If you’re dealing with dozens or hundreds of sites, the maintenance alone can eat up a huge chunk of your team’s time and budget. Here’s where AI web scrapers really shine. By leveraging natural language processing and visual analysis, these tools automate the whole data extraction process. You don’t need to know HTML, CSS, or even what a selector is. Just describe what you want, and the AI agent takes care of the rest. This shift is huge for data teams. Instead of spending hours configuring and maintaining scripts, you can set up a new extraction in minutes. And because the AI understands context, it’s much more resilient to changes in website layout or dynamic content. I’ve seen firsthand how much easier things get with tools like Thunderbit. You just click “AI Suggest Fields,” let the AI read the page, and then hit “Scrape.” That’s it. No more wrestling with selectors or worrying about whether the site uses infinite scroll. The AI figures out what’s important, structures the data, and even handles subpages or dynamic elements. It almost feels like cheating—but in the best way possible. Let’s sum up the big wins: This is my favorite part. With traditional tools, you’d need a custom script for every site. But with AI web scrapers, a single tool can generalize across multiple websites. That means faster project turnaround, less repetitive work, and more time spent on analysis instead of data wrangling. For example, Thunderbit’s AI can scrape product listings from Amazon, property data from Zillow, or contact info from niche directories—all with the same workflow. That’s a game plan for scaling up your data operations without scaling up your headaches. Let’s get concrete. Here are some scenarios where AI web scrapers are making a real difference for data teams: For more on these use cases, check out Thunderbit’s blog. Dynamic websites used to be the bane of every scraper’s existence. JavaScript-loaded content, infinite scroll, pop-ups—traditional tools would choke or require complex workarounds. AI web scrapers, on the other hand, can mimic human browsing, interact with dynamic elements, and adapt to layout changes on the fly. This resilience means less downtime, fewer maintenance emergencies, and a lot less stress for data teams. It’s like having a super-adaptable assistant who never complains about late-night website redesigns. Thinking about making the switch? Here’s how I’d approach it: For a step-by-step guide, check out How to Scrape Any Website Using AI. Looking ahead, I see AI web scrapers getting even smarter and more integrated into business workflows. We’re talking about: The bottom line? Data teams will spend less time on extraction and more time on strategy, analysis, and decision-making. The rise of AI web scrapers is more than just a technological upgrade—it’s a shift in how data teams operate. We’re moving from manual, brittle, and high-maintenance workflows to a world where automation, adaptability, and accessibility are the norm. If your team is still stuck in the old world of manual scripts and selector headaches, it’s time to take a look at what AI web scrapers can do. Tools like Thunderbit are making it easier than ever to turn the web into your personal data warehouse—no code, no stress, just results. Ready to see what’s possible?

More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

June 22, 2025 09:33 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Bengaluru: Raymond Realty, which is scheduled to list on the stock exchanges on 1 July, is looking at faster growth through higher home sales and several project launches in 2025-26, said a top company executive. The real estate firm was demerged from Raymond Ltd on 1 May and will list as a standalone entity. Mumbai-based Raymond Realty clocked around ₹2,300 crore of sales in FY25, and is targeting at least 20% growth this year. It also expects a 20% return on capital employed. Also read: Gautam Singhania meets European royal Prince Albert II: Here's why they met, what they discussed & more By the end of FY26, it plans to launch six projects - two in suburban Thane, where Raymond owns about 100 acres, and four projects in different locations across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) - Wadala, Sion, Mahim and Bandra. The developer currently has six projects under execution. Raymond Realty's residential portfolio, combining projects under execution and the ones to be launched, has a gross development value (GDV) of ₹40,000 crore. Of this, projects worth ₹25,000 crore GDV would be in Thane alone. The remaining projects of ₹15,000 crore GDV are in MMR. “In the next 3-4 years, we will double our sales and portfolio size. As a company, we are trying to solve for two things in the industry - quality of projects and timely delivery. We also want to focus on post delivery service, and have started our own facilities management arm," Raymond Realty chief executive Harmohan Sahni said in an interview. Also read: Centre links part of state capex loans to new reforms in land, and digitization The demerger will consolidate the group's real estate business under a single entity, which, going forward, will further unlock the firm's potential as a pure-play property development vertical. The company will sell at a broad price range of ₹20,000-65,000 per sq ft, and is not looking to sell below that, or in the uber luxury category. “We can't go lower than ₹20,000-22,000 per sq ft. We will not dilute the brand, and it is not a price-sensitive market," he added. MMR, India's most valuable property market, stands as one of the leading contributors to pan-India launches and sales. Most of the projects Raymond Realty has signed are redevelopment projects. The newly signed projects, in Mahim and Wadala, are a Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) redevelopment and a slum redevelopment project respectively. Also read: Centre weighs easing conditions for interest-free capex loans to states “We will continue to pursue an asset-light model by signing projects through the joint development route as it is capital efficient. We are a net debt-free company," Sahni said. Beyond Mumbai, the company is exploring project opportunities to enter the Pune property market. “We are choosy about the deals we want to sign," he added. MMR among all the top cities witnessed the highest sales of around 155,335 units in 2024, almost the same as 2023. Pune followed with around 81,090 units sold. The two western markets together led residential sales last year, said Anarock Property Consultants. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity’s complexity

By Claire Sibonney, KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the co-payments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — “Star Wars,” “American Ninja Warrior” and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” ©2025 KFF Health News. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: What Analysts Think of Micron Stock Ahead of Earnings

Full Content:
Micron Technology (MU) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker's profits to more than double from a year ago. Analysts on average expect Micron to report revenue of $8.86 billion, up 30% year-over-year. It's projected to post adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or $1.61 per share, up from $702 million, or $0.62 per share, a year earlier. In March, the Nvidia (NVDA) partner posted quarterly revenue that topped analysts' expectations, thanks in part to data center sales tripling on growing AI demand. Of the 11 analysts covering Micron tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have a “buy” rating for the stock, alongside two “hold” ratings, though their consensus price target near $121 would suggest a decline from Tuesday’s close at $127.91. Shares of Micron have been on a tear in recent weeks, and have added over half of their value in 2025. The results also come after Micron earlier this month announced plans to boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development. The chipmaker said most of the money would be used for "two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia," and advanced its high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities. UPDATE—June 24, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.
